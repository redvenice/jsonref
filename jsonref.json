Chinese firms are using England\u0027s captain Harry Kane\u0027s (right) name, \u0027Ha Li Kai En\u0027 (哈里凯恩), to sell various garments, including babywear (file photo, left), swimming suits and skirtsSome of the applications were submitted by the football stars themselves though.Messi filed seven trademark applications in China in 2007 for a wide range of merchandise, including deodorant, toothpaste, postcards, alarm clocks and board games.On the other hand, Cristiano Ronaldo has 15 \u0027C Luo\u0027 applications made by himself in China to cover some rather unconventional businesses, including computer software, gemstones, Christmas decorations and even nursing homes.   MailOnline has reached out to the representatives of the footballers for comments.  Brazilian Neymar\u0027s (left) name \u0027Nei Ma Er\u0027 (内马尔) is used to sell tyres while Uruguayan Suárez (right), or \u0027Su Ya Lei Si\u0027 (苏亚雷斯), probably doesn\u0027t know there are \u0027Suárez\u0027 pots and pansFootball is one of the biggest sports in China, and successful football players are well loved by people of all age groups - from children to pensioners. But Chinese companies have a history of using the images and names of international  stars without  their knowledge or consent.The two most famous cases involved David Beckham and Brazilian footballer Ronaldo. In 2009, a company used a video clip of David Beckham - together with Victoria Beckham - to sell its Viagra-style, erectile dysfunction drugs in a TV advert, which was aired in prime time across the country.In the advert,  the image of Beckham was given a male voice-over, which gushed \u0027this is my secret weapon to satisfy Victoria\u0027.Beckham had not agreed for his likeness to be used and was said to be furious about the advert, according to a previous report.The drug was made by Beijing-based Sheng Shi Wei Tu International Biotechnology.A sales manager from the company told Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post that the advert had been approved by the Chinese authorities.          Brazilian footballer Ronaldo is shown apparently holding a box of Golden Throat sweets in an advertisement in 2003. The famous player hadn\u0027t agreed to the usage and sued the company          The image of David Beckham - together with Victoria Beckham - was used by a Chinese company to sell its erectile dysfunction drugs in a nation-wide infomercial in 2009In 2003, Brazilian footballer Ronaldo\u0027s image was used by  a pharmaceutical company, Golden Throat, without his consent.In the TV and printed advertisements, Ronaldo was seen smiling while holding a box of the company\u0027s throat-soothing sweets.The TV advert was aired extensively on national networks, including Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, for as long as three years.China Daily reported  that Ronaldo complained about the \u0027illegal\u0027 usage in 2007 and even hired lawyers to prepare for a lawsuit against Golden Throat.The report claimed that Ronaldo had missed seven contracts with an estimated total worth of €22.4million (£19.8million) a year because of the Golden Throat advertisements. However, the lawsuit didn\u0027t proceed due to unexplained reasons, reported Chinese financial news site yicai.com. Golden Throat subsequently replaced Ronaldo\u0027s image with that of Kaká, another Brazilian football player. Kaká was officially contracted by Golden Throat and was paid 14.3million yuan (£1.62million) for three years for the advertisements, according to yicai.com.           Chinese diary company Mengniu has allegedly paid £4.5 million for Messi to be its ambassador          Wahaha, a large beverage company, is the sponsor of Portugal national football team in ChinaChinese people\u0027s passion towards football stars is simply unbelievable. Any products with a football star\u0027s name or likeness associated to them would sell like hot cakes.On the other hand, Chinese copyright law and image rights are notoriously complicated, a factor that the advert makers may have considered would protect them from a lawsuit.While small Chinese firms compete to be the first to register football stars\u0027 Chinese names as trademarks, more and more high-profile Chinese brands  are shelling out to sign international football stars to represent their products.Mengniu, China\u0027s second-largest dairy company and an official sponsor of World Cup 2018, has hired Lionel Messi to be its ambassador. The signing fee is said to be 40million yuan (£4.5 million).Wahaha, China\u0027s largest beverage company, inked a deal with Portugal national football team earlier this year to be their official World Cup sponsor in China.Wey, a made-in-China car brand, engaged Cristiano Ronaldo in a minute-long advertisement to be aired throughout China during World Cup. Ronaldo is also the latest ambassador of the auto label, which is a namesake of its billionaire Chinese founder Jack Wey (魏建军).          Chinese President Xi Jinping is known for his passion for football. Xi (centre) is seen kicking a Gaelic football as he visits the Croke Park in Dublin on February 19, 2012These impressive commercial contracts also came after China Super League teams had spent billions in the past few years to buy top-notch players from European clubs.Meanwhile, Chinese advertisements are ubiquitous in the Russian stadiums during this year\u0027s World Cup - even though team China is not even in the game. Perhaps Chinese president Xi Jinping\u0027s passion for football could help explain the country\u0027s craze for the game. Xi once said: \u0027I am a football fan. Chinese football has been trying very hard.\u0027The leader\u0027s three wishes are for China to qualify for the World Cup, host the World Cup and win the World Cup. \u0027It\u0027s the secret weapon with which I can satisfy Victoria\u0027: David Beckham used to sell anti-impotence drugs in China... without him knowing | Daily Mail OnlineRonaldo to sue China\u0027s Guangxi Golden Throat Group"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/14/4E16F0B500000578-5937227-image-a-170_1531231102830.jpg","title":"The Queen joined Harry Meghan royals arrive RAF service","story":"    Left to right: Prince Charles, Prince Andrew (behind), the Duchess of Cornwall, the Queen, the Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace          Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three, were allowed to watch the spectacle from a window of the palace          The Queen, dressed in blue in a nod to the RAF, applauded as the fly-past roared over Buckingham Palace          Vintage military aircraft perform a fly past over the Queen Victoria Memorial and Buckingham Palace          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who yesterday christened their son Louis, appeared in excellent spirits on the balcony          The Earl of Wessex, Countess of Wessex and the Princess Royal attend a reception at Horse Guards Parade, London, to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force          Prince William, 36, right, shared a joke with his new sister-in-law the Duchess of Sussex, left, as they stood on the balcony          Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Michael of Kent attend a reception at Horse Guards Parade, London, to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force       Look beautiful in blue like Kate in a coat dress by Alexander McQueenShop the current collection at NET-A-PORTERIt\u0026#39s fair to say the Duchess of Cambridge has found a style that suits her and she\u0026#39s sticking to it.

I was the last cadet to wear it, and now she is wearing it. It is the best accesory.\u0027Although the Duchess is not a cadet they seem to think she was deserving of the brooch.

I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

Shepard, none of which had been seen for almost 50 years.The famous illustration maps the magical world of Winnie-the-Pooh and captures the unique personalities of A.A. Milne\u0027s much-loved characters.Eeyore is depicted with his head hanging sluggishly in the grass, while the energetic Roo bounces towards the \u0027sandy pit\u0027 where he plays.          The Hundred Acre Wood is possibly the most famous map in children’s literature, as the setting for the cherished adventures of Christopher Robin and his friends Winnie-the-Pooh, Piglet and EeyoreA solitary Winnie-the-Pooh sits thoughtfully looking out over the wood to his friend, Christopher Robin, who stands with boyish arrogance looking back.Sotheby\u0027s said: \u0027Once Milne had created the literary landscape of the hundred acre wood and surrounding features, it was Shepard who firmly established the visual setting. \u0027With typical Shepard humour the map is supposed to be the work of Christopher Robin (\u0027Drawn by me and Mr Shepard helpd\u0027) and includes a number of Christopher Robin’s own spellings (piknicks, raletions and rox).\u0027          The top illustration shows best friends Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh walking hand-in-hand to say their final goodbye at the top of the Forest. A.A.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet!

It helps Gareth wears one properly – well-fitting (never baggy) and with the bottom button unfastened (don\u0027t ask why, you just do).    Female celebs including Victoria Beckham, Catherine Zeta-Jones and cyclist Victoria Pendleton (right). Henry Deedes approves of Zeta-Jones\u0027s \u0027monochrome magic\u0027, and says Pendleton \u0027looks fabulous\u0027. However, he was unimpressed with Beckham wearing nothing underneath her waistcoat (left)But perhaps people feel they also in some way reflect this likeable young England side: They\u0027re bold, innovative, endearing – a hark back to more genteel, civilised era. So chaps, get rootling around your wardrobe to find that cast-off you wore several years ago to your mate\u0027s wedding.Now fasten it up – doesn\u0027t that snug sensation around your front make you feel more muscular, more, dare I say it, manly?Thanks to Gareth, waistcoats are cool and ripe for a comeback.Bring \u0027em home, boys."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/15/4E1F6A1D00000578-5941517-image-a-18_1531320504942.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan arrive meet Irish leader Michael Higgins","story":"    The Duke and Duchess will view the historic Book of Kells and visit The Long Room of the Old Library at Trinity College, which contains the oldest harp in Ireland after their walkabout          Located in the former Custom House Quay, the interactive museum tells the story of the 10 million Irish people who have emigrated across the world.

They were very conscious that this isn\u0027t just about history, that this thing is still going on around us today and it\u0027s relevant to what we do today. The couple both managed to make a speedy change of clothes before arriving at Croke Park museum\u0027Every inidual is moved by what they see, which is incredibly rewarding. It is an incredibly important story between Britain and Ireland.\u0027They were profoundly moved to see the memorial and hear the story behind it. It is part of our joint histories.\u0027Meghan was very strong on the link with the city of Toronto where she lived and Harry spent a lot of time. The city only had 18,000 inhabitants but as those ships came across in their droves, Toronto took in 38,000 disease-ridden, starving famine victims. In the stadium museum the couple saw replica jerseys used in the film Michael Collins, which depicted the shooting, as well as the whistle used by the referee that day and a match ticket.They also saw club records featuring Collins, a key figure in the Irish independence movement, from when he was secretary of the Geraldines GAA club in London between 1909 and 1915. It was the IRA operation led by Collins to kill 14 undercover British intelligence agents operating in Dublin - known as the Cairo Gang - that led to the security forces opening fire on the crowd at Croke Park.Out on the pitch they watched as groups of boys and girls played hurling, camogie - the women\u0027s equivalent - Gaelic football and \u0027fun and run\u0027, a rounders-like game designed to be inclusive for people with disabilities. As the couple met Joe Canning, the Galway player who is regarded as one of the modern greats of hurling and is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Ireland, Harry told him: \u0027Apparently you\u0027re like a god.\u0027Harry also met a red-headed boy in wheelchair, Nathan Kiely, seven, and told him how impressed he was with his freckles. Jennifer Lawless, 22, an intern from North Carolina, said: \u0027He said, \u0027You have more freckles than I have. Lovely freckles!\u0027Although the couple were both given hurleys - the curved stick used to hit the ball, or sliotar, in hurling - the duke passed up on the opportunity of having a go himself.It is, however, very difficult: even Joe Canning missed his first shot at goal when he was showing the couple how it was done by the experts. \u0027The first one was a disaster,\u0027 he said. \u0027I had to redeem myself with the second one.\u0027He added about the duke not having a go: \u0027He didn\u0027t want to do it. I was thinking he might, but he will stick to the soccer later on, I think.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a youngster taking part in a Gaelic games demonstration          Undeterred by the drizzle, the Duchess of Sussex even braved the grassy pitch in her stiletto heels  In 2011, Harry\u0027s grandparents The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the arena, as part of their historic state visit to IrelandAs the couple walked round the hallowed turf, Meghan in her high heels, one onlooker said: \u0027I would guess that that is the first time a pair of stilettos has been seen on the pitch.\u0027Chatting to youngsters from the hurling pitch, Harry picked up the hurley and said: \u0027That\u0027s really light, isn\u0027t it?\u0027Picking up a goalie\u0027s helmet, Harry asked Tom Whooley, nine, if he had ever been hit in the face by a ball. When he answered no, the duke asked him: \u0027Have you hit a ball into someone else\u0027s face? Not yet? Working on it!\u0027 \u0027Meghan was very well informed about this link and Harry knew a great deal too. They were very conscious of this.\u0027While the couple were viewing the memorial there a handful of cat calls from across the river.          Harry follows in the footsteps of  the Queen the Duke of Edinburgh who visited Ireland\u0027s largest and most iconic sporting arena, as part of their historic state visit to Ireland in 2011          The stadium is the venue for the highest profile events on the Irish sporting calendarOne man and a woman could be heard shouting Sinn Fein slogans and another lone man shouted a crude remark at the duchess. Neither appear to have heard it, however, said Mr Gillespie.The pair also met excitable fans - one of whom said Meghan had \u0027made her life\u0027. Dylan Mahon, who is from Grange Rath, Co Meath, is a member of St Colmcille\u0027s GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) club who met Harry at Croke Park.Afterwards Harry told him: \u0027You might have a beard soon - you never know!\u0027The visit to Croke Park was a chance for the couple to see children being coached in traditional Irish games. But it was also an opportunity for the duke and duchess, who are on the second day of their tour of Ireland, to see mementos of one of the most notorious days in Anglo-Irish history.On November 21, 1920, British forces opened fire at a Gaelic football match between Tipperary and Dublin, killing 14 spectators and players including the Tipperary captain Michael Hogan.The day, which became known as the original Bloody Sunday, has become enshrined in Irish folklore. But while the atrocity has lost none of its capacity to appal, a historic gesture of peace and forgiveness was made in 2011 when the Queen became the first monarch to be welcomed at Croke Park since the shooting.Now it is firmly on the itinerary for visiting members of the royal family.          At one point, Meghan urged Harry to have a go at hurling, but he politely declined to get involved     The couple chatted with the players who are involved with community outreach projects          Harry gave his wife a stern look as they held hands during their tour around the historic grounds          Croke Park is the headquarters of, the GAA. Prior to the Association buying the stadium in 1913, the grounds were privately owned    The couple were taken on a tour of the stadium\u0027s museum before going on to the pitch for a sports demonstration          The pair were pictured chatting and joking with young gaelic footballers at Croke Park           The Duke and Duchess heard about the important role that GAA plays in Irish life during their trip           The pair, accompanied by a security detail, strolled around the grounds of Croke Park           Meghan\u0027s second and final day in Dublin got off to a busy start performing two engagements before lunch time - and her wardrobe was equally busy          The Duchess of Sussex wore two outfits in the space of an hour and a half, in the form of an estimated total of £17,04 worth of designer labels  Meghan, 36, was pictured in a trouser suit for the first time since her wedding having last worn one to an awards event back in February             The couple looked delighted as they made their way out onto the pitch, despite the dismal weather           The pair were also shown exhibits from Croke Park\u0027s museum, including artefacts from the Bloody Sunday massacre          Meghan, 36, who brought one of her dogs to London when she relocated, looked delighted to meet the president\u0027s pets  As ever, Meghan looked ine in black velvet court shoes and a taupe green dress by designer Roland Mouret    The Duke and Duchess met with the President Michael Higgins at Aras an Uachtarain this morning          The Duchess of Sussex was snapped gazing adoringly at her husband Prince Harry as they attended a formal reception          The pair then made their way to Croke Park museum, home of Ireland\u0027s largest sporting organisation, the Gaelic Athletic Association  Meghan is a known friend of Mouret\u0027s with French designer Roland Mouret making appearances on her now deleted Instagram account so it came as no surprise to see her her opt for one of his pieces today          The Duchess of Sussex looked ready for business in the taupe dress and Fendi handbag - one of her most professional looks          The Duchess giggled as she stroked the large dog - and the pampered pooch looked just as pleased to meet the royal visitor      The Duchess of Sussex looked confident in her role as she smiled for the cameras at the official photo call          The Irish president and his wife looked delighted to meet the newlyweds on the second day of their visit          The Duchess of Sussex was the picture of polished perfection in the grey dress, black bag and black heels          Ireland\u0027s President Michael Higgins embraced the Duchess of Sussex while his wife, a former actress, giggled at a joke she made           Meghan put a hand on Sabina Higgins\u0027 back as they made their way back down to the steps to continue their day of engagements           The President and his wife cheerily waved from the steps of Aras an Uactharain as Meghan and Harry made their way to their car and on to their next engagement           Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex signed only with their first names in a visitor\u0027s book during the Presidential meetingIn a hurry, Meghan?

One containing the opening words of St Matthew\u0027s Gospel \u0027Book of Generation\u0027 and the other St Mark.The book comprises 650 pages on high quality calf velum.

Humphrys got more than £600,000 in last year\u0027s figures, but the BBC says t his salary will drop below £300,000    The pay of household name stars including Tess Daly is not knownBBC stars paid by BBC Studios, a TV production and distribution company, do not have to have their salaries disclosed. The company makes many of the BBC\u0027s popular programmes, but has been a commercial entity since April 2017 and is not funded by licence fee payers. Stars of programmes including Top Gear, Strictly Come Dancing, Planet Earth II, Doctor Who, Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys, EastEnders, Casualty and The One Show - all created by BBC Studios - are off the list, or have just portions of their salaries shown.For example, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman was last year in the £450,000 - £499,999 pay bracket, but in the 2018 report, she is in a £370,000 - £379,000 pay bracket for hosting a weekly show on Radio 2 and a \u0027range of programmes and series\u0027 on BBC.Her fee for hosting Strictly now does not appear.Casualty actor Derek Thompson, EastEnders star Danny Dyer and Strictly Come Dancing judge Dame Darcey Bussell are among those who were featured on last year\u0027s list, but have now dropped out.Some of the stars no longer the list: Zoe Ball, who made up to £300,000 in the last pay list, does not appear as  Strictly: It Takes Two is made by BBC StudiosMatt Baker and Alex Jones are also no longer on the list because The One Show is made by BBC Studios                                                       BBC accused of using \u0027smoke and mirrors\u0027 to mask how much rich-list stars are paidThe BBC agreed with the Government to publish its top salaries annually. But it includes stars only paid directly by the licence fee.This means a string of major celebrities, who are paid directly by production companies or the BBC\u0027s commercial arm, can be left out. It is thought a third of the stars who appeared last year may be absent this time.BBC Studios was created to let the corporation sell shows to rival broadcasters and compete with giants such as Netflix. It creates the likes of DIY SOS, The One Show and Strictly Come Dancing.

It will not be an official state visit with all the pomp and circumstance that comes with such a designation but, instead, a working visit.While her husband meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Melania will have her own agenda with Philip May. Melania\u0027s charm offensive: First Lady chats with Brigitte...He loves a parade: Trump to watch military display with...Awkward!

He has been out and bought a new suit,\u0027 Theresa May told theSunday Times.But Melania\u0027s time in London could be marred by the thousands of protestors expected to turn out for the Trump\u0027s visit.While the president is likely to avoid the worst of it - as he\u0027ll be having meetings and events in the British country side - the first lady will be in the capital city in the center of the storm.Details haven\u0027t been released on what school she will visit or where she will meet with veterans but children have long been an interest for the first lady. She announced her \u0027Be Best\u0027 campaign, centered on kids, in May.And Melania Trump is mimicking another first lady\u0027s visit to London. Michelle Obama\u0027s stop at a London\u0027s girls\u0027 school in April 2009 was where she felt like she found her feet as first lady. It may be the same for Melania.And while it\u0027s not a formal state visit, there will be plenty of opportunities for the first lady to shine.

She also met with school children at the Beijing Zoo in China and took a private tour of the Great Wall.She also tends to focus on children\u0027s hospitals when she travels aboard, having spent time with sick children on five of her last foreign trips.          Melania Trump will have her own agenda and events during the Europe trip          Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin, US First Lady Melania Trump, Argentinia\u0027s President Mauricio Macri, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend a G20 banquet in Hamburg last July          Melania Trump\u0027s events will be tied to her Be Best, kids\u0027 campaign          Michelle Obama met with kids at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Language School in London meet during a visit to the school on April 2, 2009When she was in Brussels last May for the NATO meeting, she stopped by the Queen Fabiolo Children\u0027s Hospital, where she spent time doing arts and crafts, posing for selfies, and giving lots of hugs. She also brought gifts for the children, including Dr. Seuss books and souvenirs from the White House. In Italy, the first lady charmed children she visited at the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome when she spoke to them in Italian. She also visited the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris.And she visited Hadassah Medical Organization, a leading Israeli hospital that is also known as a center of coexistence between Arabs and Jews, when she joined the president in the Middle East last May. After London, the first couple will head to Scotland, where Trump\u0027s mother was born and the president is expected to visit at least one of his golf courses. The last time he was in Scotland was as a presidential candidate. Finally they\u0027ll head to Helsinki for the president\u0027s sit-down with Putin.Melania Trump has had one-on-one time with Putin before. During a G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, last year she and Emanuela Mauro, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni\u0027s wife, sat on either side of the Russian president. She also ran interference with the president and Putin when the White House dispatched her to interrupt  a Trump and Putin meeting that was running overtime.Their scheduled 30 minute sit-down went on for two hours and 16 minutes.\u0027Several times, I had to remind the president, people were sticking their heads in the door, and I think they even sent in the First Lady at one point to see if she could get us out of there, and that didn\u0027t work either. We went another hour after she came in to see us, so clearly she failed,\u0027 then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said after the meeting. In addition to this being her first overseas trip since her kidney procedure, it is her first foreign travel this year. She did not join the president on his two earlier overseas travels - the G7 summit  in La Malbaie, Canada nor his Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.She wasn\u0027t allowed to fly, the president told reporters.   One game at a time and we can win like Southgate, says steely PM | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/16/4E20416600000578-5942781-image-m-43_1531324657025.jpg","title":"Russian woman glassed face shredded karaoke bar","story":"Irina Malysheva suffered severe lacerations to her face after another woman smashed a glass over her head during a row at a karaoke bar in the Russian city of Krasnodar          Larisa Livanova is accused of hitting her over the head with the glass after refusing to delete a video of her singing a karaoke song that she recorded on her phoneThe two women then stepped outside to continue the argument, where Malysheva said she threatened Livanova with a lawsuit if she did not destroy the footage.She said: \u0027Outside I asked her again to delete the video, and got the following answer: I will not delete anything, I do whatever I want!\u0027British widow, 50, \u0027gang-raped by eight hotel workers during...Double gang-rape horror: Girl, 14, is abducted and raped by...Share this articleShe said: \u0027Right after that, she punched me in the shoulder, then splashed whatever was in the glass into my face.\u0027Mrs Malysheva said she tried to defend herself and grab hold of her attacker\u0027s hands but Ms Livanova grabbed and ripped off her necklaces.

An unknown number of salaries have been wiped from the figures because rules allow the broadcaster to withhold figures on anyone being paid through the organisation\u0027s commercial arm, BBC Studios.Of those on the list last year, 24 have now had their pay hidden because the programmes they work for moved to BBC Studios. Others have left the corporation.Anyone working through a production company is allowed to have their pay kept secret and BBC Studios was spun off last April so the corporation could start selling shows to rival broadcasters and compete more effectively with giants such as Netflix.Shows created by BBC Studios include Strictly Come Dancing, The One Show, EastEnders and Casualty.

Chinese firms are using England\u0027s captain Harry Kane\u0027s (right) name, \u0027Ha Li Kai En\u0027 (哈里凯恩), to sell various garments, including babywear (file photo, left), swimming suits and skirtsSome of the applications were submitted by the football stars themselves though.Messi filed seven trademark applications in China in 2007 for a wide range of merchandise, including deodorant, toothpaste, postcards, alarm clocks and board games.On the other hand, Cristiano Ronaldo has 15 \u0027C Luo\u0027 applications made by himself in China to cover some rather unconventional businesses, including computer software, gemstones, Christmas decorations and even nursing homes.   MailOnline has reached out to the representatives of the footballers for comments.  Brazilian Neymar\u0027s (left) name \u0027Nei Ma Er\u0027 (内马尔) is used to sell tyres while Uruguayan Suárez (right), or \u0027Su Ya Lei Si\u0027 (苏亚雷斯), probably doesn\u0027t know there are \u0027Suárez\u0027 pots and pansFootball is one of the biggest sports in China, and successful football players are well loved by people of all age groups - from children to pensioners. But Chinese companies have a history of using the images and names of international  stars without  their knowledge or consent.The two most famous cases involved David Beckham and Brazilian footballer Ronaldo. In 2009, a company used a video clip of David Beckham - together with Victoria Beckham - to sell its Viagra-style, erectile dysfunction drugs in a TV advert, which was aired in prime time across the country.In the advert,  the image of Beckham was given a male voice-over, which gushed \u0027this is my secret weapon to satisfy Victoria\u0027.Beckham had not agreed for his likeness to be used and was said to be furious about the advert, according to a previous report.The drug was made by Beijing-based Sheng Shi Wei Tu International Biotechnology.A sales manager from the company told Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post that the advert had been approved by the Chinese authorities.          Brazilian footballer Ronaldo is shown apparently holding a box of Golden Throat sweets in an advertisement in 2003. The famous player hadn\u0027t agreed to the usage and sued the company          The image of David Beckham - together with Victoria Beckham - was used by a Chinese company to sell its erectile dysfunction drugs in a nation-wide infomercial in 2009In 2003, Brazilian footballer Ronaldo\u0027s image was used by  a pharmaceutical company, Golden Throat, without his consent.In the TV and printed advertisements, Ronaldo was seen smiling while holding a box of the company\u0027s throat-soothing sweets.The TV advert was aired extensively on national networks, including Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, for as long as three years.China Daily reported  that Ronaldo complained about the \u0027illegal\u0027 usage in 2007 and even hired lawyers to prepare for a lawsuit against Golden Throat.The report claimed that Ronaldo had missed seven contracts with an estimated total worth of €22.4million (£19.8million) a year because of the Golden Throat advertisements. However, the lawsuit didn\u0027t proceed due to unexplained reasons, reported Chinese financial news site yicai.com. Golden Throat subsequently replaced Ronaldo\u0027s image with that of Kaká, another Brazilian football player. Kaká was officially contracted by Golden Throat and was paid 14.3million yuan (£1.62million) for three years for the advertisements, according to yicai.com.           Chinese diary company Mengniu has allegedly paid £4.5 million for Messi to be its ambassador          Wahaha, a large beverage company, is the sponsor of Portugal national football team in ChinaChinese people\u0027s passion towards football stars is simply unbelievable. Any products with a football star\u0027s name or likeness associated to them would sell like hot cakes.On the other hand, Chinese copyright law and image rights are notoriously complicated, a factor that the advert makers may have considered would protect them from a lawsuit.While small Chinese firms compete to be the first to register football stars\u0027 Chinese names as trademarks, more and more high-profile Chinese brands  are shelling out to sign international football stars to represent their products.Mengniu, China\u0027s second-largest dairy company and an official sponsor of World Cup 2018, has hired Lionel Messi to be its ambassador. The signing fee is said to be 40million yuan (£4.5 million).Wahaha, China\u0027s largest beverage company, inked a deal with Portugal national football team earlier this year to be their official World Cup sponsor in China.Wey, a made-in-China car brand, engaged Cristiano Ronaldo in a minute-long advertisement to be aired throughout China during World Cup. Ronaldo is also the latest ambassador of the auto label, which is a namesake of its billionaire Chinese founder Jack Wey (魏建军).          Chinese President Xi Jinping is known for his passion for football. Xi (centre) is seen kicking a Gaelic football as he visits the Croke Park in Dublin on February 19, 2012These impressive commercial contracts also came after China Super League teams had spent billions in the past few years to buy top-notch players from European clubs.Meanwhile, Chinese advertisements are ubiquitous in the Russian stadiums during this year\u0027s World Cup - even though team China is not even in the game. Perhaps Chinese president Xi Jinping\u0027s passion for football could help explain the country\u0027s craze for the game. Xi once said: \u0027I am a football fan. Chinese football has been trying very hard.\u0027The leader\u0027s three wishes are for China to qualify for the World Cup, host the World Cup and win the World Cup. \u0027It\u0027s the secret weapon with which I can satisfy Victoria\u0027: David Beckham used to sell anti-impotence drugs in China... without him knowing | Daily Mail OnlineRonaldo to sue China\u0027s Guangxi Golden Throat Group"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19EFFE00000578-5938909-image-m-112_1531256425297.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan land Dublin embark overseas tour married couple","story":"Go for glamour like the Duchess of Sussex in an Emilia Wickstead dressShop the designer at MATCHESFASHION.COMThe Duchess of Sussex has been one busy lady these past 24 hours having gone from Prince Louis\u0026#39 christening, to commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force and now to Ireland with Prince Harry.As she embarks on her first overseas tour since officially joining the Royal family, all eyes will most definitely be on what Meghan is wearing.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet! Meghan puts on a confident display on the Buckingham Palace balcony one month after her nervous debut at Trooping the ColourShe\u0027s less than two months into her role as the Duchess of Sussex, but today Meghan Markle proved she\u0027s finding her feet during celebrations for the RAF Centenary.The former Suits star looked poised and confident as she joined the royal family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for the flypast, which saw the largest concentration of military aircraft in recent memory form in the skies above London to commemorate the milestone.The Queen, 92, looked up in wonder at the aeronautical display, which celebrated the history of the RAF and featured the return of Second World War aircraft including the Spitfires and Lancaster bombers, and followed a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey earlier today.          The Duchess of Sussex showed off her new confidence today as she stood in pride of place alongside the Queen on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the RAF centenary celebrations           The former Suits star seemed nervous during her Buckingham Palace debut at Trooping the Colour exactly a month ago           Meghan looked at ease as she smiled warmly at her new husband Prince Harry           Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three, were allowed to watch the spectacle from a window of the palace          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who yesterday christened their son Louis, appeared in excellent spirits on the balconyShe was joined on the balcony by her sons, Prince Charles and Prince Andrew, the Duchess of Cornwall and the \u0027Fab Four\u0027: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.But tellingly, it was the Duchess stood in pride of place alongside Her Majesty who is these days usually flanked by one of her sons in the absence of the Duke of Edinburgh.It was a sharp contrast with Meghan\u0027s balcony debut at Trooping the Colour exactly one month ago on 10th June, when the retired actress was seen looking to her husband for reassurance and nervously fidgeted with her hair.And she did her best to blend into the background, standing behind the Duchess of Cambridge and sticking close to Harry\u0027s side.

They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027                                                    His youthful side have become one of the stories of the tournament, reaching the semi-finals with a fresh and stylish philosophy that bodes well for the future.And no matter what happens tonight, Southgate insists their World Cup run is merely the beginning of what he believes will be a fruitful legacy.\u0027I\u0027ve been involved in all the plans through the age groups,\u0027 added Southgate.\u0027To have seen our younger teams have success is hugely rewarding. We know our academies are producing technically good players.\u0027We made a lot of changes with the national teams but lots of changes that helped us to be successful. We believe we have to continue doing that, constantly evolve and improve. This team, the same. The experiences of the last few weeks, the milestones they\u0027ve hit, are a great reference point moving forward.\u0027We have players in this squad who will take us forward and others coming through the age groups with belief they can win but also expectations that we should be in latter stages more regularly.\u0027Many have turned to the black market to try to get tickets for England\u0027s first semi-final in 28 years. Last night ticket touts were operating outside the Fifa ticketing centre near Dobryninskaya Metro station as England fans arrived in Moscow trying to find tickets.In desperation, some fans walked around Red Square wearing placards pleading for entry to the match.Patrick James, 26, from Welling, Kent, arrived in Moscow on Monday. Within hours he had turned to a World Cup Facebook page which saw those keen to get rid of tickets offering them to the highest bidders.He said: \u0027Basically, I went on the site and within an hour I had about 15 people – a lot of them Russians – offering category one and two tickets which cost between £200 and £330 for the semi-final for twice that amount.\u0027In the end I have agreed a £500 price with a guy I am going to meet four hours before the kick-off near the stadium.\u0027He is a Russian fan and obviously disappointed his team went out of the competition. But for me this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don\u0027t want to miss it.\u0027          The wives and girlfriends of England players have sent their love and support for the boys by posting pictures of them kissing after matches including Rebekah Vardy and Harry Maguire\u0027s partner Fern Hawkins          Elton John posted pictures of his boys in their football shirts ahead of the game tonight           Pupils, parents and teachers at Padnell Infant School in Portsmouth sent their best wishes to former student Gareth Southgate          Staff at Next\u0027s headquarters in Leicester have got into the spirit of the big game by wearing shirts and having flags on the reception desk          Nortree Motor company in Melksham, Wiltshire, have given some of their cars some very special numberplates for the day            Up to 10,000 England fans are trying to get to Russia for the biggest World Cup for a generation          England\u0027s win over Sweden in Samara on Saturday put the team one game away from the final          Boss Gareth Southgate puts his arm around star striker Harry Kane after beating Sweden and the nation will watch them with excitement and trepidation tonight  It\u0027s Red, White and Blue Square!

William said: \u0027Come on England - it\u0027s coming home!\u0027 Among the supporters who have made the trip were father and son Joe and Andrew Settle, from Bolton, who have never travelled away with England but decided they could not miss the chance to see the national side in a World Cup semi-final.For Joe, 62, it will be his first live England match. He said: \u0027I\u0027m hoping their (Croatia\u0027s) luck has run out. Two penalty shootouts and they weren\u0027t that good, they just scraped through. I think it\u0027s our year this time.\u0027There\u0027s no out and out stars and everybody just looks at them as young lads, making their way out, they\u0027ve not got above their station. And they\u0027re just thinking, \u0027we\u0027ll get behind these lads\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re not bothered about the money, they look like they are enjoying it, they want to do it and they\u0027re proud to do it for their country.\u0027He predicted a 2-0 England win and said he believed the celebrations would be on a larger scale than in 1966 if England go on to win the trophy.\u0027I remember watching 66 on TV as a little lad and going outside playing football afterwards until it was dark,\u0027 he said.\u0027It was very uplifting for the country but because there was no internet, not as much media, you didn\u0027t actually know what was going on.\u0027There were some newsreels and everybody was uplifted but this time, from every part to the country, you are going to see what\u0027s happening - it\u0027s going to be brilliant.\u0027             Kate Goodall posted this throwback photo of of her man Harry Kane scoring on his debut for England against Lithuania in 2015 with the words, \u0027What a long way you\u0027ve come!\u0027            Becky Vardy, who is unofficial leader of the English WAGs in Russia, posted this photo as she flew to Moscow this morning ready for the game with the caption: \u0027Come on England\u0027            Jamie Vardy\u0027s wife also posted this photo on Instagram as she gets ready to cheer on the boys            Model Lauryn Goodman, who is dating England star Marcus Rashford\u0027s brother, is in Red Square to show her support - and says she is \u0027excited\u0027 about tonight\u0027s big matchGeorge Lee, 59, from Hull, also backed Southgate\u0027s young team to get to the final, predicting a 2-1 win.He said: \u0027We thought we\u0027d do well because you\u0027ve got all the youngsters in now, you know there\u0027s no superstars where they just walk about, \u0027I can do what I like\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re all young, hard-working lads. These are good kids, hopefully they will win it for us. It\u0027s exciting times for these young fellas.\u0027Scott Ratcliffe and his 10-year-old son Eliott, who has broken up from school, were in the queue to pick up their Fan IDs, having arrived in Moscow on Tuesday.The 46-year-old, from Four Oaks in Birmingham, said: \u0027Absolutely flying - can\u0027t explain how good it feels, especially after Italia 90.\u0027I couldn\u0027t get there, tried three times so I\u0027ve waited 28 years to get here.\u0027I think it\u0027s going to be very tight, Croatia are not going to be a pushover, by any means.\u0027They\u0027ve got a good side, they\u0027ve improved over the years, but I look at England at the moment and think we\u0027ve got a fantastic side.\u0027You\u0027ve got to look at that squad now and think, you know what, they\u0027re going to get a result.\u0027 Model Lauryn Goodman is in Russia as she is the girlfriend of Marcus Rashford\u0027s brother. \u0027This is my first World Cup game and I just feel that from the semi finals it gets real. It gets serious. I can\u0027t wait,\u0027 she said.  Fans who flew in without tickets were being asked to pay up for tickets at four times the face value.Greedy touts inside Red Square were preying on football fans by selling the best seats with a face value of £326 for £1,750.One fan bought a ticket with a face value of around £100 for £600.Ian Clatworthy, 33, from Solihull said: \u0027I couldn\u0027t come this far and not see the match. \u0027I had a budget of £1,000 so I suppose I\u0027ve done alright but it is a shame for the guys who won\u0027t be able to see the game.\u0027 Meanwhile two more supporters said they felt \u0027lucky\u0027 at only having to pay £800 each for tickets originally costing £100.Alex Bradbury, 26, a West Ham fan, abandoned his lads weekend in Nashville and flew from the US to see the game and he and his friend fellow Londoner Robert Oliver. The advertising executive who works in America said: \u0027Its scandalous that we are being asked these prices. \u0027It\u0027s great that Rob and I have got ours but it hurts a lot to have to pay this amount of money to see your country at the World Cup. \u0027It\u0027s always the same when there\u0027s a massive tournament and people have to and be willing to pay these ridiculous prices. \u0027For me and Rob all we have ever heard about is Italy 1990 as we weren\u0027t even born so it\u0027s a dream to see England in the semi final. \u0027This World Cup has cost us a small fortune as we had tickets for the group stages but were put off by the talk of violence and racism. \u0027But since we got in last night, the Russians except for the touts have been amazingly friendly.

We earn less. Indy than the English. I will watch in a bar here.\u0027  Friends Will Carr and Dale Goulding, who made the decision to book flights last Thursday before progress was guaranteed.Mr Goulding, 27, from Clapham Junction, south London, said the plan was to get to the ticket office early and pick up any tickets being resold through official channels, and failing that they would play the touts at their own game.\u0027What the touts are doing is getting people coming to the Fifa ticket office and saying I\u0027ll give you £50 more, knowing they can sell it to and England fan for £150 more,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are going to turn up in our England tops - we\u0027re genuine. We are going to do what they are doing.    England fans travel out to Moscow in force for the semi-final with Croatia on Wednesday    England fans have begun arriving in Red Square ready for Wednesday night\u0027s game against Croatia for a place in their first World Cup final in 52 years at stake\u0027We are going to stand there and say, \u0027any tickets, we need a ticket\u0027, and if that doesn\u0027t work, we\u0027ll go to the ground.\u0027Mr Carr, 25, from Acomb, in York, said the pair knew they had to get to Russia for the game, given neither were alive the last time England played such a crucial tie.\u0027Everyone\u0027s believing,\u0027 he said. Among the first to arrive were Leeds fans Ryan Rodley, 27, and Jordan Gilmore, 29, who landed in Moscow from Manchester via Helsinki.Ryan, who runs a scaffolding firm, said: \u0027We went 1-0 up against Sweden and we were booking our flights which cost £270. \u0027We didn\u0027t know what to expect once we got here. We had no hotel and definitely very little chance of a ticket. But we had to hope.\u0027  Jordan added: \u0027This morning we paid £600 each to some Russian touts outside the official FIFA ticket office. \u0027We didn\u0027t want to risk not getting a ticket as the lines were long and nobody was giving out any information. Now we are all in and it\u0027s going to be great.\u0027 Jonathan Earlman, 33, another of the group who we\u0027re sipping beer on Red Square, added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be 2-0 to England. Once we really are in the World Cup final, we\u0027ll sea with the ticket situation. I\u0027ve heard they are going to be around £2000 each.\u0027   \u0027Come on, boys, bring this cup home!\u0027 Paul Gascoigne, Sir Geoff Hurst and Bobby Robson\u0027s widow join chorus of England greats urging Southgate\u0027s Lions to seize immortalityPaul Gascoigne has joined a legion of former England stars including Sir Geoff Hurst urging the team to seize the moment and beat Croatia tonight.The marauding midfielder\u0027s fantastic play - and tears - in 1990 made him a national hero but the team\u0027s semi-final loss to West Germany left the nation heartbroken.  Today Gazza said he hoped that he and others will be crying tears of joy tonight.If the team win it will spark complete pandemonium up and down the land even before they play in the World Cup final against France on Sunday - the first since 1966.     Paul Gacoigne\u0027s football and tears during the World Cup in 1990 elevated him to a national hero (left yesterday) and he and other stars including 1966 winner Sir Geoff Hurst (pictured with Harry Kane) have sent messages of hope and support to Gareth Southgate\u0027s teamHe told the Mirror: \u0027Come on, boys, bring this cup home. You have nothing to fear. To conquer fear, you have to face it. It is OK to cry when you win, then you have achieved something\u0027.  Former England manager Sir Bobby Robson would have been \u0027thrilled\u0027 by the progress of the current side at the 2018 World Cup, his widow has said.            A grieving Bobby Robson after his team\u0027s defeat on penalties to West Germany in 1990Lady Elsie Robson also claimed that the former manager would be willing Gareth Southgate and his team to win the tournament \u0027with every fibre of his being\u0027.Sir Geoff Hurst is \u0027convinced\u0027 England will emulate the success of his 1966 team by lifting this year\u0027s World Cup.The striker - who remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final - said the players have the chance to become immortal.And he thinks a 2018 win would bring wilder celebrations - because the tournament is \u00271,000 times bigger\u0027 than it was 52 years ago.Sir Geoff said: \u0027Bearing in mind the last two tournaments were an absolute disaster, if I said before the tournament that we were going to win it I would have been looked upon as being deranged.\u0027But now you ask me today - and we can win it, it\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027I am absolutely convinced it will happen, the interest throughout the country with photographs and videos of people celebrating is like nothing before.\u0027The World Cup is 1,000 times bigger today when we played at the World Cup we weren\u0027t even playing much in Europe and had been beaten in a previous tournament by the USA 1-0.\u0027The advice I would give the England team going into the semi-finals is continue to do whatever it is you are doing. They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027            Sir Bobby\u0027s widow Lady Elsie, who says her husband would be so desperate for England to winThe former West Ham United equalised for England against West Germany in the 1966 final - before clinching the game with two goals in extra time.It was the only World Cup hosted in England - and a crowd of 93,000 spectators filled London\u0027s Wembley Stadium to watch.The Queen and Prince Phillip watched from the stands - with 400 million people tuning in from their living rooms.Sir Geoff added: \u0027When excitement reaches this level, it transcends the sport and it becomes a national event and people who may have not been very passionate before are now doing the opposite because they can\u0027t do or see anything without it being about the World Cup.\u0027People will remember exactly where they were at that moment in time. When any sport does well it starts to inspire people and none more so than the biggest sport in this country, football.\u0027He said of his hat-trick: \u0027I don\u0027t think I would be sitting here talking to you having scored three if we would have got beat in the final.\u0027That record still stands - it\u0027s hard to beat but it is nowhere near as important as the team winning the game.\u0027   \u0027So hard to concentrate... please can it be 7pm already?\u0027 Anxious England fans post hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work ahead of tonight\u0027s World Cup clashAnxious England fans are posting hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work as they count down the minutes to the historic World Cup clash with Croatia.Workers across the country are struggling to concentrate at their desks as they nervously clock-watch their way through one last shift before tonight\u0027s big match.England will face off against Croatia in Moscow at 7pm tonight, after sailing through their quarter-final clash with Sweden with a 2-0 win.But even after waiting 28 years to reach a World Cup semi-final, the anticipation of just one more day is proving too much for most of England\u0027s workforce.

Humphrys got more than £600,000 in last year\u0027s figures, but the BBC says t his salary will drop below £300,000    The pay of household name stars including Tess Daly is not knownBBC stars paid by BBC Studios, a TV production and distribution company, do not have to have their salaries disclosed. The company makes many of the BBC\u0027s popular programmes, but has been a commercial entity since April 2017 and is not funded by licence fee payers. Stars of programmes including Top Gear, Strictly Come Dancing, Planet Earth II, Doctor Who, Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys, EastEnders, Casualty and The One Show - all created by BBC Studios - are off the list, or have just portions of their salaries shown.For example, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman was last year in the £450,000 - £499,999 pay bracket, but in the 2018 report, she is in a £370,000 - £379,000 pay bracket for hosting a weekly show on Radio 2 and a \u0027range of programmes and series\u0027 on BBC.Her fee for hosting Strictly now does not appear.Casualty actor Derek Thompson, EastEnders star Danny Dyer and Strictly Come Dancing judge Dame Darcey Bussell are among those who were featured on last year\u0027s list, but have now dropped out.Some of the stars no longer the list: Zoe Ball, who made up to £300,000 in the last pay list, does not appear as  Strictly: It Takes Two is made by BBC StudiosMatt Baker and Alex Jones are also no longer on the list because The One Show is made by BBC Studios                                                       BBC accused of using \u0027smoke and mirrors\u0027 to mask how much rich-list stars are paidThe BBC agreed with the Government to publish its top salaries annually. But it includes stars only paid directly by the licence fee.This means a string of major celebrities, who are paid directly by production companies or the BBC\u0027s commercial arm, can be left out. It is thought a third of the stars who appeared last year may be absent this time.BBC Studios was created to let the corporation sell shows to rival broadcasters and compete with giants such as Netflix.

It will not be an official state visit with all the pomp and circumstance that comes with such a designation but, instead, a working visit.While her husband meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Melania will have her own agenda with Philip May. Melania\u0027s charm offensive: First Lady chats with Brigitte...He loves a parade: Trump to watch military display with...Awkward!

They were both at the G20 but because of timetables and so forth he wasn\u0027t able to meet her there. He has been out and bought a new suit,\u0027 Theresa May told theSunday Times.But Melania\u0027s time in London could be marred by the thousands of protestors expected to turn out for the Trump\u0027s visit.While the president is likely to avoid the worst of it - as he\u0027ll be having meetings and events in the British country side - the first lady will be in the capital city in the center of the storm.Details haven\u0027t been released on what school she will visit or where she will meet with veterans but children have long been an interest for the first lady. She announced her \u0027Be Best\u0027 campaign, centered on kids, in May.And Melania Trump is mimicking another first lady\u0027s visit to London. Michelle Obama\u0027s stop at a London\u0027s girls\u0027 school in April 2009 was where she felt like she found her feet as first lady. It may be the same for Melania.And while it\u0027s not a formal state visit, there will be plenty of opportunities for the first lady to shine.          U.S. first lady Melania Trump and France\u0027s first lady Brigitte Macron, Sweden Prime Minister\u0027s spouse Ulla Lofven, Belgian Prime Minister\u0027s partner Amelie Derbaudrenghien, Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar\u0027s partner, Mojca Stropnik, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev\u0027s partner Desislava Radeva, Turkey\u0027s first lady Emine Erdogan, Jens Stoltenberg\u0027s spouse Ingrid Schulerud, European Council President Donald Tusk\u0027s wife Malgorzata Sochacka, and Luxemburg\u0027s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel\u0027s husband, Gauthier Destenay, attend a concert at the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel in Waterloo, Belgium          Amelie Derbaudrenghien, the partner of Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, left, speaks with U.S. first lady Melania Trump, center, and French first lady Brigitte Macron          U.S. first lady Melania Trump and France\u0027s first lady Brigitte Macron share a moment as they attend a concert at the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel in Waterloo          The president and first lady arrived in Europe on Tuesday for a week-long visit          The first lady has focused on children\u0027s issues as part of her agendaThe Mays will host a glitzy black tie dinner for the Trumps on Thursday evening at Blenheim Palace, the ancestral home of the Spencer Churchill family and the birthplace of Winston Churchill. And Queen Elizabeth II will welcome the first couple at Windsor Castle on Friday with a military parade before they have tea.Buckingham Palace said Wednesday the Trumps will be greeted by an honor guard formed of the Coldstream Guards and will receive a royal salute before the U.S. national anthem is played.But her time in London with school children is where Melania Trump may be most comfortable.On previous overseas trips she has focused on children, her main area of interest.Last November, in Japan, she and First Lady Akie Abe visited a local school where they learned to write in calligraphy. She also met with school children at the Beijing Zoo in China and took a private tour of the Great Wall.She also tends to focus on children\u0027s hospitals when she travels aboard, having spent time with sick children on five of her last foreign trips.          Melania Trump will have her own agenda and events during the Europe trip          Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin, US First Lady Melania Trump, Argentinia\u0027s President Mauricio Macri, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend a G20 banquet in Hamburg last July          Melania Trump\u0027s events will be tied to her Be Best, kids\u0027 campaign          Michelle Obama met with kids at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Language School in London meet during a visit to the school on April 2, 2009When she was in Brussels last May for the NATO meeting, she stopped by the Queen Fabiolo Children\u0027s Hospital, where she spent time doing arts and crafts, posing for selfies, and giving lots of hugs. She also brought gifts for the children, including Dr. Seuss books and souvenirs from the White House. In Italy, the first lady charmed children she visited at the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome when she spoke to them in Italian. She also visited the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris.And she visited Hadassah Medical Organization, a leading Israeli hospital that is also known as a center of coexistence between Arabs and Jews, when she joined the president in the Middle East last May. After London, the first couple will head to Scotland, where Trump\u0027s mother was born and the president is expected to visit at least one of his golf courses. The last time he was in Scotland was as a presidential candidate. Finally they\u0027ll head to Helsinki for the president\u0027s sit-down with Putin.Melania Trump has had one-on-one time with Putin before. During a G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, last year she and Emanuela Mauro, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni\u0027s wife, sat on either side of the Russian president. She also ran interference with the president and Putin when the White House dispatched her to interrupt  a Trump and Putin meeting that was running overtime.Their scheduled 30 minute sit-down went on for two hours and 16 minutes.\u0027Several times, I had to remind the president, people were sticking their heads in the door, and I think they even sent in the First Lady at one point to see if she could get us out of there, and that didn\u0027t work either. We went another hour after she came in to see us, so clearly she failed,\u0027 then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said after the meeting. In addition to this being her first overseas trip since her kidney procedure, it is her first foreign travel this year. She did not join the president on his two earlier overseas travels - the G7 summit  in La Malbaie, Canada nor his Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.She wasn\u0027t allowed to fly, the president told reporters.   One game at a time and we can win like Southgate, says steely PM | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/16/4E20415200000578-5942781-image-a-44_1531324660634.jpg","title":"Fan frenzy reaches crescendo ahead Englands World Cup kick off","story":"    Gareth Southgate is pictured comforting his England players in Moscow after the Three Lions were beaten 2-1 by Croatia in the World Cup semi final          Southgate, pictured here with Danny Rose, went around each of his players to reassure them after the end of the game          Captain Harry Kane was hugged by defender Phil Jones, pictured, and looked dejected at the final whistle after extra time          The players sank to their knees in Moscow when the whistle blew having led the match early on when Kieran Trippier scored a free kick     Southgate gathered the team together for a pep talk at the end of the game as sad faces looked on all around him          Southgate was seen going around all of his players to check on them, including Jesse Lingard, pictured, who sank to the floor after the match          Southgate, left, managed to crack a smile at the end of the game for wife Alison, centre, and son Flynn, right, as he was comforted by them           The England manager embraced his wife of more than 20 years after the match with England now facing a third-place play-off against Belgium on Saturday  The 47-year-old also saved a cuddle for his son Flynn, left, and daughter Mia, right,           Southgate also made sure to go over to the England fans and show his appreciation to them as the stadium emptied  Quarter final hero Harry Maguire sank to his knees at the final whistle, left, while Harry Kane looked dejected as he hugged Tottenham Hotspur teammate Eric Dier           Marcus Rashford, left, had a thousand-yard stare as he sat in the stands with family after the final whistle          Football fans failed to hide their disappointment as England crashed out against Croatia in the World Cup semi final          Flat Iron Square: England fans struggled to hide their anguish as the game went to extra time only for Croatia to strike a winner          Jordan Pickford was crying in the stands with girlfriend Megan Davison, left, as his family tried to comfort him          Goalscorer Kieran Trippier looked downcast as he was commiserated by his family in the stands of the Moscow stadium          Dele Alli was given a kiss by his girlfriend Ruby Mae following the defeat as the players came to terms with the result          Cult hero Harry Maguire also received some affection from his girlfriend Fern Hawkins in the stands after the match          Fans at home were just as devastated, with some in a litter-strewn Hyde Park pictured embracing as they faced reality          One England fan in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow wiped a tear away from her glittery eyes at the end of the game          Fans in Manchester, pictured, all struck a similar pose as they mourned the defeat to Croatia \u0027I don\u0027t think over the six or seven weeks we\u0027ve been together we could have given more than we have.\u0027 Fans in Bristol held their heads in their hands and wept following England\u0027s defeat to Croatia.Some threw drinks to the ground and stormed out of Ashton Gate Stadium, though some struck a more conciliatory tone.Josh Quinn, 22, from Bristol, said: \u0027It was a disappointing performance from England.WAGs console their Lions: Players\u0027 partners offer a shoulder...‘Everyone seems to know the score…’ Dejected England fans...\u0027It hurts, it hurts a lot\u0027: \u0027Gutted\u0027 Harry Kane rues missed...Share this article\u0027The first half was amazing and the second half was terrible.

They predict a 2-0 win for the Three Lions      England fans all in Southgate-style waistcoats enjoy their day in Moscow before tonight\u0027s crunch match           Delighted England fans in Red Square last night but back home many are anxious about the match  England fans are gathering in Moscow for the big game with Croatia as millions at home face an anxious wait for the biggest game for 28 years              Among those to get into the spirit of #waistcoatwednesday were Good Morning Britain presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)  Gladstone, the resident Chief Mouser of HM Treasury at Whitehall, sports a tweed waistcoat in support of England tonight  Tanya Sansford posted a picture of herself wearing an England shirt with a colleague she works with at Marks and Spencer  while Steve Parrett has an alternative Three Lions on his shirt today   Many admitted that the day was dragging at work as they prepared to watch the game at home or in pubs across the land      Sir Geoff Hurst is \u0027convinced\u0027 England will emulate the success of his 1966 team by lifting this year\u0027s World Cup.The striker - who remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final - said the players have the chance to become immortal.And he thinks a 2018 win would bring wilder celebrations - because the tournament is \u00271,000 times bigger\u0027 than it was 52 years ago.Sir Geoff said: \u0027Bearing in mind the last two tournaments were an absolute disaster, if I said before the tournament that we were going to win it I would have been looked upon as being deranged.\u0027But now you ask me today - and we can win it, it\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027I am absolutely convinced it will happen, the interest throughout the country with photographs and videos of people celebrating is like nothing before. \u0027The advice I would give the England team going into the semi-finals is continue to do whatever it is you are doing. They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027                                                    His youthful side have become one of the stories of the tournament, reaching the semi-finals with a fresh and stylish philosophy that bodes well for the future.And no matter what happens tonight, Southgate insists their World Cup run is merely the beginning of what he believes will be a fruitful legacy.\u0027I\u0027ve been involved in all the plans through the age groups,\u0027 added Southgate.\u0027To have seen our younger teams have success is hugely rewarding. We know our academies are producing technically good players.\u0027We made a lot of changes with the national teams but lots of changes that helped us to be successful. We believe we have to continue doing that, constantly evolve and improve. This team, the same. The experiences of the last few weeks, the milestones they\u0027ve hit, are a great reference point moving forward.\u0027We have players in this squad who will take us forward and others coming through the age groups with belief they can win but also expectations that we should be in latter stages more regularly.\u0027Many have turned to the black market to try to get tickets for England\u0027s first semi-final in 28 years. Last night ticket touts were operating outside the Fifa ticketing centre near Dobryninskaya Metro station as England fans arrived in Moscow trying to find tickets.In desperation, some fans walked around Red Square wearing placards pleading for entry to the match.Patrick James, 26, from Welling, Kent, arrived in Moscow on Monday. Within hours he had turned to a World Cup Facebook page which saw those keen to get rid of tickets offering them to the highest bidders.He said: \u0027Basically, I went on the site and within an hour I had about 15 people – a lot of them Russians – offering category one and two tickets which cost between £200 and £330 for the semi-final for twice that amount.\u0027In the end I have agreed a £500 price with a guy I am going to meet four hours before the kick-off near the stadium.\u0027He is a Russian fan and obviously disappointed his team went out of the competition. But for me this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don\u0027t want to miss it.\u0027          The wives and girlfriends of England players have sent their love and support for the boys by posting pictures of them kissing after matches including Rebekah Vardy and Harry Maguire\u0027s partner Fern Hawkins          Elton John posted pictures of his boys in their football shirts ahead of the game tonight           Pupils, parents and teachers at Padnell Infant School in Portsmouth sent their best wishes to former student Gareth Southgate          Staff at Next\u0027s headquarters in Leicester have got into the spirit of the big game by wearing shirts and having flags on the reception desk          Nortree Motor company in Melksham, Wiltshire, have given some of their cars some very special numberplates for the day            Up to 10,000 England fans are trying to get to Russia for the biggest World Cup for a generation          England\u0027s win over Sweden in Samara on Saturday put the team one game away from the final          Boss Gareth Southgate puts his arm around star striker Harry Kane after beating Sweden and the nation will watch them with excitement and trepidation tonight  It\u0027s Red, White and Blue Square!

William said: \u0027Come on England - it\u0027s coming home!\u0027 Among the supporters who have made the trip were father and son Joe and Andrew Settle, from Bolton, who have never travelled away with England but decided they could not miss the chance to see the national side in a World Cup semi-final.For Joe, 62, it will be his first live England match. He said: \u0027I\u0027m hoping their (Croatia\u0027s) luck has run out. Two penalty shootouts and they weren\u0027t that good, they just scraped through. I think it\u0027s our year this time.\u0027There\u0027s no out and out stars and everybody just looks at them as young lads, making their way out, they\u0027ve not got above their station. And they\u0027re just thinking, \u0027we\u0027ll get behind these lads\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re not bothered about the money, they look like they are enjoying it, they want to do it and they\u0027re proud to do it for their country.\u0027He predicted a 2-0 England win and said he believed the celebrations would be on a larger scale than in 1966 if England go on to win the trophy.\u0027I remember watching 66 on TV as a little lad and going outside playing football afterwards until it was dark,\u0027 he said.\u0027It was very uplifting for the country but because there was no internet, not as much media, you didn\u0027t actually know what was going on.\u0027There were some newsreels and everybody was uplifted but this time, from every part to the country, you are going to see what\u0027s happening - it\u0027s going to be brilliant.\u0027             Kate Goodall posted this throwback photo of of her man Harry Kane scoring on his debut for England against Lithuania in 2015 with the words, \u0027What a long way you\u0027ve come!\u0027            Becky Vardy, who is unofficial leader of the English WAGs in Russia, posted this photo as she flew to Moscow this morning ready for the game with the caption: \u0027Come on England\u0027            Jamie Vardy\u0027s wife also posted this photo on Instagram as she gets ready to cheer on the boys            Model Lauryn Goodman, who is dating England star Marcus Rashford\u0027s brother, is in Red Square to show her support - and says she is \u0027excited\u0027 about tonight\u0027s big matchGeorge Lee, 59, from Hull, also backed Southgate\u0027s young team to get to the final, predicting a 2-1 win.He said: \u0027We thought we\u0027d do well because you\u0027ve got all the youngsters in now, you know there\u0027s no superstars where they just walk about, \u0027I can do what I like\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re all young, hard-working lads. These are good kids, hopefully they will win it for us. It\u0027s exciting times for these young fellas.\u0027Scott Ratcliffe and his 10-year-old son Eliott, who has broken up from school, were in the queue to pick up their Fan IDs, having arrived in Moscow on Tuesday.The 46-year-old, from Four Oaks in Birmingham, said: \u0027Absolutely flying - can\u0027t explain how good it feels, especially after Italia 90.\u0027I couldn\u0027t get there, tried three times so I\u0027ve waited 28 years to get here.\u0027I think it\u0027s going to be very tight, Croatia are not going to be a pushover, by any means.\u0027They\u0027ve got a good side, they\u0027ve improved over the years, but I look at England at the moment and think we\u0027ve got a fantastic side.\u0027You\u0027ve got to look at that squad now and think, you know what, they\u0027re going to get a result.\u0027 Model Lauryn Goodman is in Russia as she is the girlfriend of Marcus Rashford\u0027s brother. \u0027This is my first World Cup game and I just feel that from the semi finals it gets real. It gets serious. I can\u0027t wait,\u0027 she said.  Fans who flew in without tickets were being asked to pay up for tickets at four times the face value.Greedy touts inside Red Square were preying on football fans by selling the best seats with a face value of £326 for £1,750.One fan bought a ticket with a face value of around £100 for £600.Ian Clatworthy, 33, from Solihull said: \u0027I couldn\u0027t come this far and not see the match. \u0027I had a budget of £1,000 so I suppose I\u0027ve done alright but it is a shame for the guys who won\u0027t be able to see the game.\u0027 Meanwhile two more supporters said they felt \u0027lucky\u0027 at only having to pay £800 each for tickets originally costing £100.Alex Bradbury, 26, a West Ham fan, abandoned his lads weekend in Nashville and flew from the US to see the game and he and his friend fellow Londoner Robert Oliver. The advertising executive who works in America said: \u0027Its scandalous that we are being asked these prices. \u0027It\u0027s great that Rob and I have got ours but it hurts a lot to have to pay this amount of money to see your country at the World Cup. \u0027It\u0027s always the same when there\u0027s a massive tournament and people have to and be willing to pay these ridiculous prices. \u0027For me and Rob all we have ever heard about is Italy 1990 as we weren\u0027t even born so it\u0027s a dream to see England in the semi final. \u0027This World Cup has cost us a small fortune as we had tickets for the group stages but were put off by the talk of violence and racism. \u0027But since we got in last night, the Russians except for the touts have been amazingly friendly.

We earn less. Indy than the English. I will watch in a bar here.\u0027  Friends Will Carr and Dale Goulding, who made the decision to book flights last Thursday before progress was guaranteed.Mr Goulding, 27, from Clapham Junction, south London, said the plan was to get to the ticket office early and pick up any tickets being resold through official channels, and failing that they would play the touts at their own game.\u0027What the touts are doing is getting people coming to the Fifa ticket office and saying I\u0027ll give you £50 more, knowing they can sell it to and England fan for £150 more,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are going to turn up in our England tops - we\u0027re genuine. We are going to do what they are doing.    England fans travel out to Moscow in force for the semi-final with Croatia on Wednesday    England fans have begun arriving in Red Square ready for Wednesday night\u0027s game against Croatia for a place in their first World Cup final in 52 years at stake\u0027We are going to stand there and say, \u0027any tickets, we need a ticket\u0027, and if that doesn\u0027t work, we\u0027ll go to the ground.\u0027Mr Carr, 25, from Acomb, in York, said the pair knew they had to get to Russia for the game, given neither were alive the last time England played such a crucial tie.\u0027Everyone\u0027s believing,\u0027 he said. Among the first to arrive were Leeds fans Ryan Rodley, 27, and Jordan Gilmore, 29, who landed in Moscow from Manchester via Helsinki.Ryan, who runs a scaffolding firm, said: \u0027We went 1-0 up against Sweden and we were booking our flights which cost £270. \u0027We didn\u0027t know what to expect once we got here. We had no hotel and definitely very little chance of a ticket. But we had to hope.\u0027  Jordan added: \u0027This morning we paid £600 each to some Russian touts outside the official FIFA ticket office. \u0027We didn\u0027t want to risk not getting a ticket as the lines were long and nobody was giving out any information. Now we are all in and it\u0027s going to be great.\u0027 Jonathan Earlman, 33, another of the group who we\u0027re sipping beer on Red Square, added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be 2-0 to England. Once we really are in the World Cup final, we\u0027ll sea with the ticket situation. I\u0027ve heard they are going to be around £2000 each.\u0027  \u0027So hard to concentrate... please can it be 7pm already?\u0027 Anxious England fans post hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work ahead of tonight\u0027s World Cup clashAnxious England fans are posting hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work as they count down the minutes to the historic World Cup clash with Croatia.Workers across the country are struggling to concentrate at their desks as they nervously clock-watch their way through one last shift before tonight\u0027s big match.England will face off against Croatia in Moscow at 7pm tonight, after sailing through their quarter-final clash with Sweden with a 2-0 win.But even after waiting 28 years to reach a World Cup semi-final, the anticipation of just one more day is proving too much for most of England\u0027s workforce.

Seriously it\u0027s our time - LETS GO ENGLAND.\u0027Meanwhile, England fan Jay Harriot asked: \u0027Anyone else sat at work counting down the minutes?\u0027Nervous football fans across England are also embracing \u0027Waistcoat Wednesday\u0027 this morning ahead of the national side\u0027s momentous game against Croatia.Everyone from officer workers to morning television presenters are donning sleeveless vests in anticipation of England\u0027s first World Cup semi-final since 1990.  Unfashionable for decades, suddenly waistcoats are selling out thanks to Gareth Southgate... so here\u0027s the tricks to get them right, whatever your gender As England\u0027s footballers lined up for their penalty shoot-out against Colombia last Tuesday, the temperature inside Moscow\u0027s Spartak Stadium was a balmy 20 degrees.Watching at home and perspiring like wildebeest, there was something so reassuring about the team\u0027s unflappable manager Gareth Southgate, who remained on the touchline a Zen-like figure of calm.His blue shirt remained devoid of any flecks of damp. His tie was affixed in a neat Windsor knot.                Trend setter: Gareth Southgate, Manager of England        From left, John Virgo, David Beckham and Eddie Izzard: but Henry Deedes suggests stepping away from jazzy, silky numbers and \u0027slobby sleeves\u0027. Izzard looks \u0027perfect\u0027, he saysMost of all though, it was that waistcoat which, in this tensest of situations, remained resolutely fastened.That, my friends, is what I call style.Waistcoats have had a rough ride over the last few years. They are to men what the beret is to women. Hard to pull off, oh so easy to ridicule.But Gareth\u0027s waistcoat is leading a resurgence. M\u0026ampS, who provided the England team kit, say they\u0027ve nearly run out of the £65 garment such has been the demand – and their other styles have seen huge spikes in sales. Even the Moscow branch of M\u0026ampS has run out of most sizes of the waistcoat.And now there\u0027s \u0027Waistcoat Wednesday\u0027 – a huge social media movement urging both sexes to wear waistcoats in support of England during the semi-final against Croatia. Hugh Grant has tweeted he\u0027s taking part, as have presenters Andrew Marr and Jeremy Vine.Why the waistcoat resurgence? It helps Gareth wears one properly – well-fitting (never baggy) and with the bottom button unfastened (don\u0027t ask why, you just do).New emotional footage shows boys being saved from Thai caveEngland stars¿ partners travel together for the big gameZagreb erupts as Croatia makes it to the World Cup final\u0027Germany is totally controlled by Russia\u0027: Trump at NATO meetingFormer Foreign Secretary leaves his Colton Gardens home in LondonThai boys give wave to the world in first video since rescueWoman slips note to vet staff about armed and abusive boyfriendHarry and Meghan thrilled to receive framed gift from Dublin crowdWe\u0027re over the moon.

Planned to stand like an oversize party hat in the garden of John Soane’s sober Dulwich Picture Gallery, the great Technicolor crown is the winning design for the Dulwich Pavilion. The biennial commission, now in its second year, is a youthful alternative to the Serpentine’s established pavilion programme across the river. Selected through an open competition and co-organised with the London Festival of Architecture, it aims to provide a platform for emerging designers rather than global stars, bringing some fresh energy to the oldest purpose-built gallery in the world.“We were trying to imagine what might have happened if Soane had extended his European grand tour to the African continent,” says Dingle Price, one half of Pricegore, the practice behind the winning design, who developed their proposal with furniture designer Yinka Ilori. “We wanted to come up with something that could be more representative of today’s London, and attract a wider range of people to the gallery.”The architects established their office in 2013 down the road in Peckham Rye – the heart of London’s Nigerian population, nicknamed Little Lagos. Ilori, whose parents were born in Nigeria, returns to Lagos several times a year to find inspiration for his bright designs. Their project, nicknamed the Colour Palace, was inspired by the vibrant hues of the Nigerian capital, particularly the textile market, where jazzy wax print fabrics are densely hung from simple framed stalls, creating cavernous warrens of clashing patterns.This cornucopia of textiles translated into a piece of architecture takes the form of a bright blue wooden space-frame clad with overlapping layers of square timber battens, painted with alternating geometric patterns on each face. The effect of these multicoloured fringes promises to be mesmerising, with the patterns shifting as you walk around the structure, like a 3D lenticular image, vivid yellow circles melding with hot pink triangles. Raised on chubby red concrete legs, the dazzling cube envelops a flexible circular stage for talks, performances and yoga classes, while a raised gantry will provide theatrical views, encircling the space like a Shakespearean theatre.“The sense of theatricality appealed to me,” says gallery director Jennifer Scott who, with six other judges, selected the design from a shortlist of six, narrowed down from 148 entries. “I love the playfulness and the way the design speaks to a cultural heritage that’s so pertinent to the area.”Without the additional funds raised by selling the pavilion to a private collector, as the Serpentine tends to do each year, the biggest challenge facing the architects is the tight construction budget – a restriction that Soane in the early 19th century also had to deal with. Eight of his schemes for the gallery were rejected, before he was forced to settle on building with exposed brickwork “in a plain and substantial manner”, only using expensive Portland stone in the lantern, frieze and along the base of the building.But the constraints proved to be a boon, prompting a high level of rigour and invention in the layout and natural lighting of the interior, where the gallery spaces are arranged around an amber-windowed mausoleum for the gallery’s founders. Soane’s sequence of top-lit spaces have provided a model for gallery buildings around the world ever since.Dulwich hopes its pavilion budget of just £60,000 will prompt an equal level of ingenuity, and has launched a fundraising drive to meet the target. As for Pricegore and Ilori, may their painted palace usher in a rainbow future, a more joyous strand of architecture that isn’t afraid to indulge in pattern and colour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdeb6a6cf7f9b858fbc9b9884070f67cf7669efc/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=678547ac66433c0674ff0db435d95d29","title":"the smart clothes that could soon give people with autism a hug","story":"A new wearable technology could ease the effects of overstimulation for people with sensory processing disorder (SPD) and autismFor all the ways in which technology has transformed our lives, the digital revolution has done little to change what we wear. Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

In my novel The Possible World, three characters each find themselves abruptly spilled into unfamiliar lives: six-year-old Ben, the only survivor of a brutal crime his doctor Lucy, facing the dissolution of her marriage centenarian Clare, harbouring her own story of cataclysm, carrying secrets that will affect the destiny of the other two. All of them struggle with memory, identity and meaning while seeking a way forward into their new lives.Maybe we read about disruption to avoid having to undergo it. Here are some books that offer vicarious experiences of mayhem and renewal:1. Life After Life by Kate Atkinson (2014) The riveting saga of Ursula Todd, who is born and dies in 1910 and is then reborn again and again into the same life, things going a little bit differently each time. She carries memories forward, and as the world marches through one war and then into another, the reader wonders if she will be able to budge the course of history. It is a masterpiece. I strongly recommend the audiobook the narrator Fenella Woolgar’s performance is a tour de force of its own. 2. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman (2017)At first we might pity Eleanor, the 30-year-old odd-bird outcast who lives in a rut of lonely vodka weekends and supermarket pizza. When a sudden passion for a pop star jolts Eleanor out of her track and she resolves to remake herself, her journey out of isolation is hilarious, surprising and poignant. The book doesn’t shy away from serious themes – “loneliness is the new cancer”, Eleanor says – but the sadness is perfectly balanced with hope. Damaged, quirky and above all resilient, Eleanor is a modern heroine. 3. The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver (1998)Evangelist preacher Nathan Price takes his wife and four daughters from 1950s America to the Congo. The Prices drop into Africa as naively as babes landing in the jaws of crocodiles. Told in multiple voices, this is a coming-of-age story in quadruplicate, as well as a parable about colonial arrogance. A family reinvents itself here, and also a country: the spectacular backdrop is a culture undergoing massive changes of its own. 4. Jasmine by Bharati Mukherjee (1989)A dark odyssey about a suddenly widowed Indian teenager who decides to fulfil her late husband’s cherished dream of moving from Punjab to Florida. She reinvents herself as needed, from Jyoti into Jasmine, Jazzy, and Jase, and finally into Jane, a 24-year-old Iowan housewife. Her voyage brings her to a crisis: she must decide which of her many selves is the authentic one, and which life can claim to be her destiny. 5. Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts (2003)This epic tome recounts the exploits of an Australian prison escapee who gets off a train into the chaos of Bombay. He disappears into the city, tucking himself into the slums and a vigorous exile. The tale is narrated with an irresistible, can-you-believe-it grin, its author an Australian prison escapee who lived a decade in Bombay. The line between fact and fiction is aggressively blurred. Best not to speculate – simply hang on for the long, wild ride. 6. Wave by Sonali Deraniyagala (2013)The memoir of a daughter, wife and mother, who has all of those identities ripped away simultaneously when her parents, husband and two young sons are taken by the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami. You would not think that anyone could survive such a loss without going mad – and she does go a little bit mad in this short book, which is something of a contained howl. It’s also a brave exploration of grief, and a luminous celebration of her lost loved ones. 7. Fifty Acres and a Poodle by Jeanne Marie Laskas (2000) A fortyish urbanite cherishing a lifelong yearning for open spaces drives past a picturesque farm one day – and buys it. She and her boyfriend upend their lives, and while the story of their adjustment is at many points highly comical, it is not a slapstick romp, it’s an engaging and tender testament to the beauty of the unexpected and the rewards of following your heart. There is indeed a poodle, who stars in perhaps the funniest anecdote in the book.  8. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce (2012) When a mysterious rose-pink envelope arrives for Harold, a 65-year-old man who “doesn’t know anyone anywhere”, it ruptures his stagnant life. His spontaneous decision to walk 600 miles to answer the letter makes a captivating, uproariously funny, often profound pilgrimage story. There are actually two pilgrims in this book, both grappling with buried sorrows and seeking redemption: Harold, walking through the beautifully described countryside, and his wife left behind at home. A deeply sentimental, highly enjoyable book. 9. His Illegal Self by Peter Carey (2008) Che Selkirk never knew his parents, outlaw hippie terrorists who abandoned him to a life of sanitised privilege with his wealthy grandmother. He’s eight years old in 1972 when he opens the front door of his Manhattan home to a woman he thinks might be his mother. When a chance to abscond with her arises, he willingly goes. The two skip across the globe, evading authorities, and end up in the Australian wilderness. In a matter of days, Che goes from upper-crust American to unwashed child savage. A fascinating, highly layered novel. 10. Lady Oracle by Margaret Atwood (1976)From its opening words, “I planned my death carefully,” the reader is consumed by the dilemma of Joan Foster, who has made a habit of secrets. A celebrated poet, a beauty and a wife, she is concealing a past of morbid obesity, a current infidelity and a flourishing career as a romantic novelist. Tripping over her own deceptions, she fakes her death and escapes to Italy. There, memory clouds Joan’s new life in a way she didn’t anticipate, and she realises that there may be a limit to one person’s capacity to self-reinvent. Wickedly intelligent, this is an early Atwood gem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec55d55868a59fe99b074f46608d909a0590d721/0_122_4008_2406/master/4008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f48d48d084a1cc92cf46bdf9b6f4e9e1","title":"comcast 26bn offer sky rupert murdoch bid","story":"Murdoch raised his initial offer to £24.5bn one day before bid clearance by UK governmentComcast has moved swiftly to table a £26bn offer to buy Sky, trumping Rupert Murdoch within hours of the media mogul tabling a new £24.5bn offer.Comcast’s £14.75p a share offer comes within hours of Murdoch making a new £14 a share offer valuing Sky at £24.5bn.Murdoch moved to up his original bid – of £10.75p a share – ahead of the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, finally clearing the bid on Thursday.Comcast’s first £12.50 a share offer, valuing Sky at £22bn, resulted in Sky’s independent committee recommending shareholders reject Murdoch’s original £10.75 deal tabled in December 2016.

They’ve exploded in popularity this year, riding the wave of trends like declining car ownership and increasing preference for renting rather than owning outright.These transport systems are quickly becoming ubiquitous – but what role can they play in the cities of tomorrow? The update to Citymapper offers an insight only if the kinks can be worked out – and it’s both more and less transformative than we might hope.Floating transport has obvious appeal to investors, especially those sore to have missed out on the Uber gravy train. Venture capitalists’ enthusiasm to jump on the next big thing in transport is the best explanation for the astounding US $300m (£226m) raised by scooter company Bird, at a valuation of $1.7bn, last month. That was matched this week by Uber and Google’s investment in Bird competitor Lime at a $1.1bn valuation, as the company rolls out (sorry) its bright green scooters to Paris, entering Europe for the first timeUnlike precursors such as docked cycle hire, or fixed-parking car hire (think Zipcar), the initial outlay is very small. There’s no need to build docks or pay cities for permanent parking spaces, and while demand remains high, the numbers are good – really, really good.A Bird scooter, for instance, will conservatively gross about $10 a day, according to Bloomberg’s Brad Stone. That’s five short rides, give or take. The scooter needs to be recharged – a job done by gig economy contractors who are paid $5 per recharged scooter – so the net profit per day is $5. With those figures, a $300 scooter with $50 worth of modifications including the GPS tracker and locking mechanisms, then pays for itself in two months.But simply being profitable doesn’t necessarily mean floating transport is good for a city, and the growth of the sector has been a bumpy ride. A big problem is that pavement is a shared space, and a limited resource. The overcrowding problems San Francisco has seen with Bird scooters are mirrored in London by Ofo bikes – a model where users abandon their vehicles wherever they want inevitably results in pavements littered with out-of-service rides.That can be annoying, unsightly or actively dangerous, depending on the circumstances. In London, parents have complained of having to push prams onto the road to get round piles of bikes, while wheelchair users in LA can find a previously accessible route blocked by a wayward scooters.While floating transport is free from many of the regulatory burdens faced by previous transport startups, it’s not immune. Electric scooters, for instance, can’t easily expand to the UK, because they aren’t legal to use on the road or the pavement. Dockless cycle hire faces similar trouble in Australia, where helmets are required by law.Citymapper is betting, though, that despite hurdles on a regional level, this is the future globally. The app currently has a slim level of integration with most floating transport providers – inidual bikes, cars and scooters will appear on the map, along with information like charge level. But they aren’t yet seamlessly combined with the company’s flagship multi-modal journey planner.When that does happen, as Citymapper has said, the services will be presented like any other mode of transport. If it’s quicker to hop on an Ofo bike and cycle to the tube than it is to wait for a bus, it will show as an option.But the company’s mock-up of how it might look in the app– showing a notional journey from transport-deprived Stoke Newington, in north-east London – conceals some of the potential flaws of floating transport. It’s easy enough to plan a journey that begins with a three-minute walk to a bike and ends with 30 minutes on the tube, but it’s somewhat harder to plan your return trip. Will the bike still be there? Or would you have been better off taking an entirely different route in the first place? (That’s not a hypothetical concern – it has happened to me a few times. It’s worse still when you arrive at a bike you’d intended to use to find it still there but not actually working, because it hasn’t yet been reported and removed from the map.)Floating transport also faces similar problems to those that docked cycle hire discovered in its early years: iniduals’ movement through cities is highly correlated. Rush hour is the obvious example, but other trends become clear if you spend long enough staring at data visualisations of where, say, London’s Santander bikes are at any given time. Try to find a docking space outside Hackney’s Victoria Park at 1pm on a sunny summer Saturday, and eight hours later, you’ll have just as hard a time trying to find a bike to get home with.Now imagine trying to solve that problem without docks where would-be renters can at least wait in the hope that a bike will be dropped off.Many floating transport providers have realised these potential pitfalls, and are taking steps to address them. Some bike providers, for instance, have followed the lead of London’s cycle hire network, and now collect bikes left in out-of-the-way places and drop them near transport hubs. Jump, an e-bike provider now owned by Uber, lets users “preorder” bikes, renting them in advance (and still paying by the minute) to ensure they’re there when they need them.And of course, smart transport planners play their own part. If we could give ourselves over fully to Citymapper and its ilk, religiously following instructions to the letter even on journeys which we think we know, then the app could merrily reroute as and when the circumstances on the ground change, erting users towards bikes that have suddenly appeared for rent, or telling them to hop on a bus if someone’s beaten you to a scooter.But ultimately, floating transport is going to have to learn another lesson that conventional transportation bodies have taken to heart: flexible may be fun, but cities run on reliable.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5877f7230c6c828344d858659adb4d7fb0dff56/0_140_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=010d93326750265c8f51fea0ee7fce34","title":"the guardian view on controlling social media the start of a long road","story":"Facebook has been fined five and a half minutes’ revenue – the most the law allows – for breach of data protection regulations in connection with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This is a welcome recognition of the tireless work done by the Observer on the story. But it must only be the beginning of a wider examination of the ways in which big data shifts the balance of power in a democratic society. Even if it can never be proved that the manipulation of social media swung either the EU referendum or the election of Donald Trump, there is much to be concerned about in what has come to light as a result of investigations that started with Facebook.This is one of those cases where suspicion is almost as damaging to trust in institutions as proven malfeasance could be. Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, has said that what’s at stake is “transparency, fairness and compliance with the law”. This is exactly right. The companies with our data target us as iniduals, but appear themselves as faceless – indeed bodiless – manipulators who know far more about us than we do about them. That asymmetry is where the novel danger to democracy lies. The power it offers is hard to resist: one of the investigations announced by the commissioner today is into a marketing firm which approaches new mothers at their most vulnerable moment to collect their data, some of which was then sold on to the Labour party. In all these cases the regulators are playing catchup, as is apparent from the ludicrous inadequacy of the fine on Facebook. They are chasing a moving target. The increasing use of internet-connected widgets in the home and on our bodies, and – with face recognition – in every public space, ensures there will soon be unimaginable amounts of data for the unscrupulous to harvest and use.

But are there deeper reasons behind the sudden love for him?Who is the male fashion icon for summer 2018?Jeff Goldblum. What’s that, you cry? A 65-year-old dude who has been around longer than many of your readers have been alive? You have lost your mind, Freeman! Not yet, my friends. Not yet.Goldblum is one of those perennials – like a fine wine, a little black dress – who gets more delectable with time. Many of us first noticed him in Annie Hall, looking for his mantra, and resembling a tall, dark glass of Guinness. He then debuted his trademark fast-talking geek persona in The Big Chill, later perfected in The Fly. Shall we run through some of Goldblum’s greatest hits? G’wan, treat yo’self! His swarthy weirdness in The Tall Guy, his otherworldly smouldering in Earth Girls Are Easy and, best of all, his legendary purr of a laugh in Jurassic Park. Fans all have their favourite Goldblum phase: some like the fresh-faced innocent of the 70s, others the eccentric silver-haired jazz player of today.Maybe it is true that our tastes are formed in childhood because my favourite Goldblum will always be the shaggy-haired, shag-me faced one of the 80s, whom I first saw when my mother – for reasons that defy comprehension now – took me and my little sister to see Earth Girls Are Easy. Well, let’s just say that the moment Jeff, freshly shorn of his alien fur, steps out of the salon left a VERY strong imprint on an impressionable mind. Hmm. Yes. Mmm.ANYWAY. So, we all know about Goldblum’s enduring appeal – the issue is why is he so relevant now. Well, “Jeff: summer 2018 style icon” was confirmed when he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel in the US, wearing a, shall we say, distinctive shirt from Prada’s autumnwinter 2018 collection. As it happened, Pusha T wore the same shirt the same week and a Twitter poll about who wore it best inevitably named Jeff the winner, because one of them may well be a celebrated hip-hop star, but the other one is Jeff Goldblum, and when you go up against Jeff in the style stakes, my friend, you are a wooden sword and he is drone warfare.Goldblum is having what we in the business call “a fashion moment”. He can be found in GQ, posing in Pucci swimming shorts, larking around in Prada and apparently having the time of his life. Fashion blogs are ablaze with discussions about his essential Jeff-ness, and why it is so essential. The question, really, is why now? Why the sudden love for Jeff from all these Jeff-come-latelies, when he has always been exactly as he is now: goofy, eccentrically dressed, cheerful, handsome? He hasn’t changed, but we must have. How?Well, you will all be relieved to know that I have been thinking about this a lot. Here is my theory: Jeff represents the opposite of everything we are seeing in the US at the moment. While the rest of the country is hopelessly locked in the deranged news cycle, Goldblum comes across as an ethereal eccentric who doesn’t even read a newspaper, let alone a news website. Goldblum doesn’t waste time on social media because he is too busy making a jazz album, hanging out with fellow oddballs in jazz clubs and buying utterly absurd shirts in Prada – because why not? And it has to be said, he looks a lot happier, and better, than the rest of us.More than that, Goldblum represents not giving a damn. Without getting into an “Oh, social media oh, Kardashians oh, narcissism – what a world” rant, Goldblum, for a celebrity, comes across as refreshingly unconcerned with how he looks. The fact that he wore that completely ridiculous shirt on Kimmel sums up his modus operandi: he cares so little about how he looks that it’s cool. He just happens to have an amazing, innate sense of high-fashion, wearing clothes that look absurd and wouldn’t get past any stylist, but are adored by fashion people who, by nature, love absurd clothes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb695ad927f6a4f9707c7feefd3472de4aa560f/0_89_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=660187c180d9552c096cc1ebc6f76fe9","title":"joaquin phoenix best roles film","story":"A career filled with unconventional choices has led the Oscar nominee to a banner period working with Lynne Ramsay, Gus Van Sant and Jacques AudiardFor an actor who has cultivated an image of relative Hollywood hermitude, Joaquin Phoenix has been awfully visible lately, fidgeting uncomfortably in a spotlight that nonetheless keeps landing on him. This week, his starring role in Gus van Sant’s Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far On Foot hits cinemas in the US – and depending on where you are in the world, it’s his third major release of 2018 so far.In the UK, the March cinema schedule gave us a particularly disconcerting Phoenix double-whammy. One week, he was a taciturn, tortured assassin exacting grievous violence on toxic men in Lynne Ramsay’s brutal stunner You Were Never Really Here. The next, he was literally Jesus Christ – still taciturn, definitely still tortured, but ostensibly a more benevolent presence – in Garth Davis’s prettily soporific religious drama Mary Magdalene. (Or, as atheistic wags might also call it, You Were Never Really Here.) The performances may have had more in common than they would in the hands of most other actors – you’ve never seen the son of God quite this blearily emo – but the ideological whiplash between the projects was still striking. (With Mary Magdalene still mired in Weinstein Company legal quicksand, Americans will find this out when, if ever, it gets released.)Phoenix isn’t done for the year, either: this autumn, we’ll see his starring role in the darkly comic gold rush western The Sisters Brothers, the first English-language film by the esteemed French auteur Jacques Audiard. By any measure, that’s a robust quartet of projects, at least in terms of prestige and intent (Mary Magdalene turned out to be a critical and commercial non-event, though it wasn’t for want of ambition on the part of anyone involved). Phoenix would have to be pretty spectacular in the Audiard film to supplant You Were Never Really Here as the high point of not only Phoenix’s year, but just about any actor’s: as Joe, the silent-storm hitman concealing tidal waves of trauma beneath a grizzled, ungiving exterior, he brought sore-souled complexity, psychic pain and a stoic streak of gallows humour to what would otherwise be a familiar noir type. It’s a characterisation that ranks with his raddled, feckless sociopath Freddie Quell from Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master as perhaps the richest of his career so far, and it justly won him best actor at Cannes last year by rights, it should net him a fourth Oscar nomination, though the odds are against Academy voters having the stomach for Ramsay’s visceral, despairing film. Perhaps they’ll gravitate toward Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot instead, for which he’s garnered further glowing notices – notwithstanding protests from some quarters about casting an able-bodied actor in the role of a quadriplegic. Phoenix plays the real-life cartoonist John Callahan, with the film tracking his journey to sobriety after the alcohol-abetted car accident that landed him in a wheelchair at the age of 21. It’s the kind of true story that could easily translate into icky inspirational pablum – particularly if the more maudlin Van Sant of Finding Forrester and Sea of Trees had shown up on set – but Phoenix’s presence alone provides the perverse, unsentimental wit that marks Callahan and his work. Now in his 40s, the actor has long shown a knack for crinkling and darkening the edges of even the most straight-and-narrow films, since well before he gave us cinema’s scuzziest Jesus. We saw it as early as 1989, in Ron Howard’s bright family dramedy Parenthood, in which the 14-year-old Phoenix (then still going by the Christian name Leaf) quietly disrupted the sitcom tone of proceedings with his portrait of a withdrawn, nascently porn-fixated adolescent. Eleven years later, he was a thrillingly strange, sinuous ner in the robust Hollywood works of Gladiator, his venal emperor Commodus bringing not just boo-hiss villainy to proceedings, but a streak of vulnerably defensive irony and subtly queer sexuality it was a performance inspired and unsettling enough to earn him his first Oscar nomination. It was the performance that essentially made Phoenix – then 26 and skew-whiff sexy, with that hard gaze and scarred lip that, for the most part, conveniently ruled him out of teenage-dream roles in his formative years – a star. Yet aside from a loopy pair of M Night Shyamalan projects and the handsome, trophy-chasing biopic duty of Walk the Line, in which he was more suited to Johnny Cash’s brand of hard-knock cool than the varnished film-making around him, he rarely acted accordingly. Forgoing studio cinema, he opted for a mixed bag of indies (such the misfires as It’s All About Love and Reservation Road) and developed a solemn, burnished collaboration with the Cannes-beloved, 1970s-inspired American auteur James Gray, culminating in a bittersweet romance, Two Lovers, that was a virtual paean to his anxious, anti-Hollywood-leading-man qualities. That, of course, was the lead-up to I’m Still Here, the ambitious mockumentary stunt that for too long had the world convinced Phoenix was either a buffoon or a critically damaged egomaniac, and over as an actor either way. The convenient narrative would have had critics declaring Phoenix’s hilariously garbled, meta-upon-meta feat of self-parody as his crowning glory, if not for the unexpected upshot on the other side – as Phoenix rebounded from the lark with the most disciplined, detailed, straight-up acting of his career in The Master. Since that watershed, there’s been no fooling about, even when the projects have been playful: Anderson’s Inherent Vice may have been a shaggy-dog stoner odyssey, but Phoenix’s spaced-sad, perfectly behind-the-beat comic delivery in it was perfectly studied. His delicate, nebbishy romantic ache in Spike Jonze’s Her was an unexpected, empathetic twist on his talents, while his Gray collaboration hit an operatic peak with the morally charred balance of evil and regret in his 1920s Ellis Island pimp in The Immigrant, still sadly unreleased in the UK – his final, spiritually wrecked scene in it is up with the best of Brando. There have been missteps, albeit not thoughtless ones. He was saddled with one of the rotten modern-era Woody Allen scripts in Irrational Man, and would likely have proven ill-matched to Allen’s fussy, hyper-verbal neuroses even if he hadn’t been, while as interesting a pick as he is to play Jesus, he seems more glazed than intense in the beige, tasteful surroundings of Mary Magdalene – if it never gets seen stateside, his career certainly won’t be worse for it. But if these are the blurry spots in Phoenix’s filmography as he heads into his middle age, he’s doing well — he’s even toying with the mainstream again, with his casting as the Joker in an upcoming origin story officially, as of this week, a go. That said, with a relatively low planned budget of $55m, Todd Phillips’ film is rumoured to be on the more experimental end of the blockbuster spectrum: the superhero machine may come for them all, it seems, yet Phoenix still gets to do it somewhat on his own terms. With Daniel Day-Lewis supposedly retired and the consensus title of Greatest Working Actor up for grabs, Phoenix’s latter-day CV makes as good a case as any. Not that he’d want to be called that, most likely — but if his recent, inventive run of activity has proven anything, it’s that his can’t-be-arsed persona, sealed in I’m Still Here and still wafting around him a decade later, is one hell of a performance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ee03c4e9108dd0490c25ccc3eacad8cbe47689/0_87_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263c655ae9f3ee1417d680103ff2b4b7","title":"psychology england football team change your life pippa grange","story":"England players seem happier and more grounded – and much of the credit goes to psychologist Pippa Grange. What can the team’s approach teach us all about facing fear and failure?This week, the England midfielder Dele Alli was asked if he was nervous about the big tests up ahead: first, of course, the team’s semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. “Excited, not nervous,” he replied. His apparent happiness and confidence reflected an England team that seems transformed from previous incarnations. Where once it was stuffed with entitled, surly stars, burdened with the weight of history and the pressure of expectations, it now comes across as a hungry, humble team, playing with lightness and joy.“We’ve spoken to the players about writing their own stories,” said the manager, Gareth Southgate, after the team beat Colombia in an unprecedentedly victorious (for England) penalty shootout. “Tonight they showed they don’t have to conform to what’s gone before. They have created their own history … We always have to believe in what is possible in life and not be hindered by history or expectations.”The team appears in a better place psychologically than it has for generations. Much of the credit has gone to Southgate, but also to Pippa Grange, the team psychologist, who has been working behind the scenes. “She’s an amazing person,” Alli said on Monday. “Everyone listens to her when she talks.”Grange was appointed by the FA as its head of people and team development in November last year, given the job of building resilience while confronting the pressures and psychodramas faced by previous England squads. The FA has said it searched globally for the right person for the job, but Grange, like most of the young players, isn’t an obvious superstar in her field there is no self-promoting social media presence or bestselling self-development books.She wrote in 2013 that being a woman in a male team environment “is a constant navigation, for everyone. I have no interest in being one of the lads and I don’t quite fit in the ‘nurturing mother figure’ category in terms of the leadership work I do. I would be professionally ineffective if I remained in the background, psychologically safe with minimal voice, and I am not here to be the centre of attention as some form of entertainment. I don’t want to be completely separate because that would make me inaccessible and probably be a lonely place to operate from.”The midfielder Eric Dier said: “I think a lot of the work that we’ve done with her has been prior to the tournament starting, over the last six or seven months.” This has reportedly included getting the players to sit down together in small groups to share their life experiences and anxieties, and to reveal intimate truths about their character and what drives them. The point, Southgate has said, is to build trust, “making them closer, with a better understanding of each other”.The England football team has focused on the mental side of the game before, most prominently with the psychiatrist Steve Peters, who was recruited before the 2014 World Cup. What is new is the extent to which psychology has been embraced (prior to Grange’s appointment, the performance consultancy Lane 4 was working with the FA on psychological tactics). Access to Peters, it was reported, was offered to the players only if they felt they needed it – and not many would have admitted to wanting help.“The whole group must buy into the idea that the sports psychologist has come with a specific set of skills and practices that are really worthwhile,” says Andy Lane, the professor of sport and learning at the University of Wolverhampton. “A recent turnaround in professional soccer is the preparedness to use sports science in an integrated way. It’s that acceptance by the whole group that gives one professional the chance to be effective.” Much of that culture shift will have been down to Southgate, who has shown his support for Grange, whom he clearly respects. “She is a strong and important addition to the team,” the manager said in May.Grange is a fan of inspirational quotes, from Oscar Wilde to Nelson Mandela to Michael Jordan some adorn the training gym walls (“Success isn’t given, it’s earned,” reads one). She is also said to encourage the players to get off their phones and play games with each other – including one in the hotel pool with inflatable unicorns after the win against Tunisia in the group stages and she is said to dislike social media, which she expects the players to use wisely. Southgate hasn’t banned social media – unlike previous managers, he hasn’t appeared to ban anything – but has apparently taken Grange’s thoughts on board. While he acknowledged it was good for the players to engage with fans, he added: “Personally, I’m not sure there’s value to reading comments that come in. It comes back to: what creates pressure, or what creates misery in your life?”Michael Caulfield, a sport psychologist and the co-director of the consultancy Sporting Edge, says Southgate, with whom he worked at Middlesbrough, has a leadership style “built on incredible levels of trust between him and his players and staff. He was determined to convince the team there was nothing to fear from playing in the World Cup for England, whereas in the past people were nervous or fearful. He was determined to change that mindset from one of fear to one of adventure. That’s the biggest thing he’s done.”When someone is under a moment of extreme pressure, using a tactic such as mental cues can be helpful, says Kate Hays, the head of psychology at the English Institute of Sport. “People will have cue words that will bring them back into focus on the task at hand – for some, they could be emotional cues for others, it could be technically focused. It’s just one or two words that can get people to focus on the right thing.”Southgate, who has experienced his own disappointments – that missed penalty at the semi-finals of Euro 96, and his managerial career at Middlesbrough ending in relegation – has said as much: “I have learned from things that have gone wrong and had to pick myself up … Because of those failures, I feel it gives you the freedom of being able to say, ‘How might we be the best possible team?’ and not be afraid of what goes wrong – because whatever goes wrong we can deal with, as I have lived through it.”Grange has no fear of failure either. She has written: “I’d like to turn this unhealthy preoccupation with success on its head and put it on the record that I think failure is really useful. For without failure we cannot progress longer, higher or faster. It’s a funny paradox – our successes are achieved through trying, and trying most often ends in failure. Every day in our general lives and our sporting lives we will win some and lose some it’s just part of the way life should be. It could be missing out on a promotion, being pipped at the line in a running race or bombing out in an exam – it doesn’t matter – the important lesson is to learn from our failures, reassess, rethink, move forward (sometimes in a different direction) and keep those dreams and goals alive.”Kevin George, the author of Soccology, who works with clubs and coaches on performance, also says that respecting the inidual qualities and personalities of your players (or your employees) is key. “To instil confidence in one player might be to give them freedom, so they know you trust them,” he says. “For somebody else, it might be a lot of praise. For a group of people, you have to tap into who they are inidually, but as a group, give them the belief that you trust them.” Singling people out for praise in a group setting can be tricky, he adds. “People can think: ‘That person’s a favourite, I’m not a favourite.’ It is tough.” Southgate doesn’t play favourites everyone feels as if they have a chance.The era of hard-talking, tyrannical managers is over – both on and off the pitch. “Football, which I love and work in, is really bad at talking,” says Caulfield. “It does instructing and telling off but it doesn’t do talking and listening and empathy that well. It sounds a bit fluffy but that’s the world in which we now live, and the world in which these players have grown up.” Southgate, he says, realised early in his coaching career that instilling fear wasn’t going to work. “We all need a telling-off now and then – and he’s good at that, by the way – but you’ll get far more from putting your faith in people than you will anything else. People had this lazy opinion that he’s too ‘nice’ and they see kindness as weakness, but it’s the most unbelievable strength if you use it in the right way.”As for nerves, it is a mistake to think it is essential or even desirable to eliminate them – from sport or from life. Caulfield says they can be “wonderful. They keep you alive and make you realise something important is about to happen. If you discuss what the nerves mean to you and how you deal with them, then they don’t become a threat to you. They become this wonderful cortisol that runs through your veins and you deal with the problem, and then you rest afterwards.” With or without an inflatable unicorn.• Don’t fear failure. “Part of what it takes to be courageous is overcoming the constant battle between the desire for what we want and the fear of failure. Most of us don’t expose ourselves because we are fearful,” writes Grange.• Reframe emotions: you’re not “nervous”, you’re “excited” a penalty shootoutjob interviewimportant speech is not something to dread, it’s an “opportunity”.• Positive thinking is unhelpful if you’re simply fantasising about achieving an Oscarthe World Cupa fuller social life. Instead, focus – positively – on the steps that could get you to your goal.• Treat your employeeschildrencustomers as iniduals rather than a homogenous group. Different approaches will work for different people.• Kindness, listening and empathy will take you further than barking orders. Use praise to motivate people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ec00965f13d416b3a5c2562d982e9c87b05e8e/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d63df79ea8aa3b08d9554fef04b8cb3a","title":"chelsea closing in maurizio sarri and manchester city target jorginho transfer window","story":"The Napoli president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, has claimed Maurizio Sarri’s move to Chelsea is edging closer and is “in the hands of his lawyers”, with Napoli’s former manager in line to be followed to Stamford Bridge by the midfielder Jorginho in what could amount to a £57.5m joint outlay.The Premier League club have been in a state of flux since winning the FA Cup at the end of last season. There has been intense haggling through the summer over compensation payoffs due to the various parties – the current Chelsea head coach, Antonio Conte, would seek payment for the final year of his contract – and that has made for\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspslow process.Chelsea had hoped resolution would be reached before the players reported back for pre-season medical tests on 7 July, but that came and went with Conte, who has expected to depart all summer, having overseen the start of training this week.Napoli unveiled Carlo Ancelotti as Sarri’s replacement on Wednesday, but have still to release their former manager from his contract. “The Sarri deal is in the home stretch, and it depends on him,” De Laurentiis said. “I’ve laid down my conditions. It’s all in the hands of the lawyers. My lawyers have drafted a text and sent it to his lawyers, and we will see what happens.”Jorginho, a Brazilian-Italian who was handed his first cap for the Azzurri by Conte, may become Chelsea’s first signing of the summer after the player apparently indicated a preference to\u0026nbspcome to London rather than join the Premier League champions, Manchester City.City, though, are understood to be unhappy with Napoli and De Laurentiis. The champions believe Jorginho does want to join City, having told Napoli two months ago he wants to play for Pep Guardiola. City believe that the player is being used by Napoli as a factor to smooth the proposed move of Sarri to Chelsea.Reports in Italy suggest the 26-year-old midfielder, who has eight international caps, would cost Chelsea a little over £50m, with the club likely to pay a further £7.5m to secure Sarri’s release. There have been reports in Italy that Cesc Fàbregas, who has entered the final year of his contract at Stamford Bridge, could move in the other direction, but the Spain midfielder is understood to have no interest in moving to Italy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f183e3024872dc0280012487854dc5807048166/0_42_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb8d96a075760c31c39258e56ac5b6a","title":"cristiano ronaldo leaving real madrid end cold","story":"Four-hundred-and-fifty-one goals. Forty-four hat-tricks. Cristiano Ronaldo’s Real Madrid stats are so absurd they threaten to overshadow what he actually did for the club‘Your goals, your numbers and everything we’ve won together speak for themselves,” Sergio Ramos said once the news finally broke. Real Madrid’s players had doubted that it would come to this, that he would really do it and that they would really let him, but this time it was real. Barely minutes after the Champions League final, before the trophy had been handed over, Cristiano Ronaldo said that it had been – past tense – nice being at Madrid. Moments later Florentino Pérez, the president with whom there was little warmth, said he had heard before and in the end nothing ever happens. But he had not, not like this, and in the end it did.The announcement was made at 5.34 Spanish time. After nine years at the Santiago Bernabéu Cristiano Ronaldo was joining Juventus for €100m (£88.3m), plus €5m to be paid to his former clubs. The 33-year-old has signed a four-year deal reportedly worth around €30m a year, after tax the total cost is estimated to be €345m.That is a lot of numbers, and there are many more. Sometimes it can feel as if that is all there is. As Real Madrid’s captain put it in his farewell to the ‘Bicho’, the Beast: your goals, your numbers speak for themselves. These are not, it appears, days for poetry, which is a pity. If a picture paints a thousand words – and the sports daily AS marked the occasion by leading on one last photo of Ronaldo topless, this time from the Greek island where the deal was closed – then it sometimes seems numbers make them obsolete. The stats say it all – especially when they are like these, so absurd.When Ronaldo was presented at Madrid, the club’s nine European Cups were lined up at the Bernabéu. He looked at them, impressed. Nine\u0026nbspyears on, four more have been added – including three in a row, four in five years. This is their most successful era, the best any club has had in the competition since they won the first five titles, led by Alfredo Di Stéfano – the man who changed their history and made them what they are, the man who sat watching Ronaldo that night, clutching his walking stick. Ronaldo also won two league titles, two Copa del Reys and three Club World Cups.More importantly – and there may be something telling in those two words – Ronaldo has won the Ballon d’Or five times and may well make that six this winter, and is the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, unsurpassed in each of the past six seasons. He scored 311 in the Spanish league. He scored 44 hat-tricks, for goodness sake. He scored more goals at Madrid than anyone else, ever. He overtook Emilio Butragueño, Hugo Sánchez, Carlos Santillana, Raúl and Di Stéfano. He averaged more than a goal a game (1.029) only Ferenc Puskas on 0.92 came close. Ronaldo scored 450 goals in 438 games. 451, according to the sports daily Marca (a deflected free-kick from 2010 remains disputed).Marca bade “farewell to a legend”, declaring “there won’t be another like him”, by printing the goals across a double-paged front cover: 451 little footballs, one for each strike, marked with the badge of the club that conceded them. The balls fill every space, peppered all across the page a telling image expressing the indiscriminate nature of it, the relentlessness that defines him, the magnitude of it all. It is a useful image too: it can be exhausting just looking at the figures, a sea of digits, and it can also be easy to gloss over them. Some variation on that old line, supposedly introduced by Stalin: one goal is a triumph but 450 of them is a statistic.And while statistics brook little argument, they also leave little room for lyricism. They can reduce everything to numbers and risk making the extraordinary routine. They normalise it – just another goal, just another hat-trick – when it is not normal. They also make it too easy to leave the analysis there, the eulogies too, failing to invite imagination or a full appreciation of an astonishing footballer who marked an era. “It was nice while it lasted,” one headline said, as if it had not lasted long when this was an entire decade of dominance at the biggest club of them all. This is part of the problem: it is as if what makes it so magnificent also makes it oddly mundane: Ronaldo? Stupid amounts of goals. And that’s it. But it is not it.Even the one that Ronaldo said was his best, the overhead kick that he scored against the club that is now his own and the goal that sits in the middle of the sea of balls on Marca’s cover, while “framed” by picture desks and declared a work of art, ended up being quantified. Diagrams purported to show how high he had leapt, the angle of his body, like something from an engineering analysis. Man becomes machine. A beast, perhaps. An extraterrestrial, Álvaro Arbeloa called him.It is a tempting analogy, easy enough to slip into and accurate enough. He is built, after all – a construction, self-made. He did this. His body shape, often exhibited, reinforces that and there are countless stories that relay ambition: weights on ankles, hours in the gym. Even within elite football teammates recognise he is different there is a touch of extremism in his application that underpins an admiration which is deep. Paul Clement, assistant coach at Madrid under Carlo Ancelotti, tells the story of the team getting back in the small hours after some away trip in Europe. The rest head wearily home Ronaldo stays at the training ground, plunging into an ice bath.Thus the machine is made and maintained – but that, by definition, is human. He is brilliant because of who he is, and so even if the natural focus is the numbers, it is worth remembering where they come from and enjoying them for what they are. Yet cold stats do not invite warmth counting goals leaves little room to appreciate them. That header in the Copa del Rey final, say although, again, that was textbook in its perfection, inviting diagrams and compasses. The skill, the touch, the quality, the technique, the feeling.The emotion is sometimes lost and the intelligence, too, is overlooked on occasion: the effort is extreme but it is also targeted, thought through. There has been self-awareness, adaptation. Zinedine Zidane, now departed, was central to that but no one was more central than Ronaldo, whose evolution has been fascinating. His game has become more focused, more limited and yet more effective than ever, and his team have been more successful. That helps explain why, at 33, Juventus believe the end is not yet nigh: his best years have come when his worst years should have done. He stepped centre stage on the biggest stages past 30. He has said he will play until he is 40 although he would not be the same, that does not seem so absurd any more.Nothing will be the same now. “He is the best in history with Di Stéfano,” Pérez said in January. Di Stéfano departed sadly too, incidentally. It is impossible to do justice to what Di Stéfano achieved, yet there was Ronaldo being held up alongside him. Perhaps the best player in the history of the most successful club there is, one of the game’s all-time greats.Pérez had said that a “new era” would begin the day that Ronaldo left. Now that he has, this does seem monumental, even if it was coming – like some staging post in life, something lost, a generational shift, the end. Madrid, though, have modified the message, seeking to avoid that melancholy. It has also been important to publicly lay responsibility for this break-up at Ronaldo’s door. There may be blame at some point.For all the coldness of the conclusion to this era, the coldness too of the stats that fill endless pages today, the focal point of the farewell, this move is an emotional one primarily propelled by pride. Looking back on that overhead kick, when Juventus’ fans applauded and Ronaldo, slowly realising, brought his hand to his heart, one wonders if that was the start of something. There he felt the love, the affection he did not feel at Madrid. Signed by the outgoing Ramón Calderón, Ronaldo’s relationship was never close with Pérez and extra layers were added with time: the case brought against him by the Spanish tax man, the pursuit of other players, the refusal to countenance another renewal. And so in the end he went. Everyone does eventually, but not everyone is the same.His figures spoke for themselves perhaps but Ronaldo wanted to be heard too. At the end of a career that became defined by the tangible values, quantifiable and counted in goals, there was something intangible he sought. There had been threats before this time, the club decided it could not go on. Now they must confront a new era, and it won’t be easy, they know. It won’t be for anyone: this is one of those deals where it may seem that everyone wins, or perhaps that everyone loses. After the Champions League final, a European champion again, but his mind already elsewhere, Ronaldo had been asked where he would be better off than Real Madrid. “Difficult,” he said, “but life is not just about glory.”It is not just about goals either. But, bloody hell, there were a lot of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10a519c50bbd97792adf2457d011555b5338afe2/42_102_2501_1500/master/2501.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6732a892d4192c80a088fcc5f19715b7","title":"croatia england player ratings world cup semi final","story":"Danijel Subasic Suspect positioning for Trippier’s free-kick and slow to react to the shot.

All these words from them we take, we were reading and we were saying: ‘OK, today we will see who will be tired.’ They should be more humble and respect their opponents more.“We showed again that we were not tired – we dominated the game mentally and physically. We should have killed the game even before extra time. This is an amazing achievement for us - it’s a dream come true after such a long time. We are in the final and that is the biggest success in Croatia history. We have to be proud.”“The all-round perception was that this is a new-look England who have changed their ways of punting long balls upfield but when we pressed them it turned out that they haven’t. “Ivan Perisic, who cancelled out Kieran Trippier’s early goal with a fine effort of his own, admitted it was a difficult game but praised his team-mates’ perseverance for coming through a successive third knockout game after extra-time.“We knew what was at stake and how important the semi-final is for a small country like Croatia,” he said. “We started slowly today but we showed our character and again came from a goal behind just like we did in the previous knockout rounds.“Twenty years ago I was back at home in my hometown and I rooted for Croatia wearing the Croatia jersey. I could only dream of playing for my country and scoring one of the most important goals to reach the final,” Perisic said.Croatia’s coach, Zlatko Dalic, said their extra-time victory was deserved and his players were not yet finished despite playing a lot of football in the past three rounds.“We deserved to reach the final. What the lads played tonight was fantasy, they’ve made history,” Dalic said. “We haven’t said our last word, there is still one more game to go.

England’s dream of making it to their first World Cup final for more than half a century was over and in the desperate moments after the final whistle, as the losing players wandered aimlessly around the pitch, almost zombie-like in their desolation, it was impossible not to wonder whether that will be a lifetime regret.Those players will look back eventually on a tournament that has shifted England’s reputation for leaden football and tournament neuroticism. All the same, it may take some time to shake off the ordeal of losing this semifinal, the knowledge that the World Cup may never open up so obligingly again and the additional trauma from the fact that, for a long while, Gareth Southgate’s team had led us to believe they could do it. They really did.Instead, it will be Croatia who return to the Luzhniki Stadium on Sunday to face France and, in the midst of the England inquest, it would be hugely unfair on Zlatko Dalic’s team not to recognise the competitive courage that helped them recover from a goal down. The decisive moment came in the 109th minute from a striker, Mario Mandzukic, with a badly damaged knee and that itself summed up Croatia. They have won all three of their knockout games in extra time and, providing they are not on the point of exhaustion, it is still plausible the World Cup will go to a country with a population of only four million.For England, it is the third v fourth sideshow against Belgium on Saturday and, much like Bobby Robson’s beaten semi-finalists of 1990, they will desperately wish they were not there. The honour of football immortality will go to another team. Moscow 2018 can be filed with Turin 1990, and their grief was epitomised by Kieran Trippier’s tears as he was helped off in the final exchanges. Trippier had opened the scoring for England with a peach of a free-kick but his injury came after Mandzukic’s winner and the emotion poured out of him. He knew it was over.At the very least, Southgate and his players have helped redefine the way the England team are perceived around the world. New heroes have emerged, with a new respect and a new outlook. To see the England fans serenading the team, decorating this vast stadium with their flags and holding the players in such esteem, made it feel a trick of the imagination that the mood was close to mutiny not even a year ago.This England feels different: a band of brothers, comfortable in their own skin with a new spirit of togetherness. This England bend it like Trippier. This England have a guy at the back who makes it his business, in Southgate’s words, to “get his bonce on everything” in either penalty area. This England can make their supporters proud again, for the first time in a long time.Ultimately, though, we were reminded that Southgate was being deadly serious when he warned us his team were far from perfect and it must have been startling for their manager to see the way his players relinquished their control from the midway stage of the second half.Until that point, they had played with a conviction that made this feel like it could be the greatest achievement yet for a post-1966 team. Again, it felt like we were watching the compelling evidence that John Stones had become the central defender English football always wanted him to be. Dele Alli kept to his promise of playing better than he had against Sweden. Harry Maguire had been outstanding. Jordan Henderson was keeping midfield safe. England looked firmly in control.Yet they could not add a second goal when they were on top and the game swung in Croatia’s favour once Ivan Perisic had scored an improvisational equaliser in the 68th minute, showing great determination to beat Trippier and Kyle Walker to a cross from the right and twisting mid-air to turn an awkward volley, almost head-height, past Jordan Pickford.England still managed to toy with our emotions, as they often do, and it needed a goal-line clearance to prevent Stones heading in a corner in the first period of extra time. By that point, however, it was the first time in\u0026nbspthe entire tournament when England have repeatedly looked vulnerable at the back. Even before the additional 30\u0026nbspminutes, Perisic struck the post with a low, diagonal shot and Ante Rebic should have done better with the\u0026nbsprebound. It was not an onslaught, but it was not far off. Croatia had\u0026nbspenough of the ball in dangerous areas to think they might have completed the recovery before the end of normal time.All of which was tremendously disappointing from an English perspective bearing in mind the story of the first half, the energy they put into quelling the influence of Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic and the euphoria, only five minutes in, when Trippier directed a free-kick over a six-man defensive wall, applying just the right blend of curl and dip for the ball to beat Danijel Subasic and arc beneath the crossbar. As devastated as Trippier was, he will return to England as one of the authentic stars of this tournament.Unfortunately for England, Southgate acknowledged their inexperience might have counted against them during that inevitable period in the second half when Croatia committed more men forward in their search for an equaliser.Too often, an England player would rush or miscue a clearance. “Game management,” the coaches call it – and England lacked it. The shape of the team started to unravel and, though Harry Kane will almost certainly win the Golden Boot, the paradox is that he has found it difficult to get behind opposition defences.Raheem Sterling was substituted after a so-so performance and Jesse Lingard will not easily forget the first‑half chance he put wide. Kane’s best chance was given incorrectly as offside and, though it is difficult sometimes to second-guess VAR, maybe it would have stood if he could have put the ball in from close range rather than hitting the post. Hypothetical now: England will never know.Instead it was Mandzukic with the killer moment, leaving Southgate to talk about the “hardened warriors” in the Croatia team. Stones lost concentration for a split-second and the striker rifled in a left-foot shot.Was there still time for England to save themselves? Could they rouse themselves one last time? Yes and no.

And Croatia is the home which football seemed to be heading to after a helter-skelter World Cup semi-final on Wednesday.Now the rest of the world will have to work out what makes this country of four million people such a sporting powerhouse but to the crowds celebrating in the streets of Zagreb it was never a mystery.“We have heart and we are proud and we have been forged in war,” said Marian Kirin, a 39-year-old telecommunications engineer, whose father died in the conflict that followed the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.It is not an uncommon story in a part of Europe still very traumatised by violence. The players in Moscow were not spared. Serbian militiamen killed Luka Modrić’s grandfather. As a child, Mario Mandzukić was a refugee in Germany.Hours before kick-off a hundred thousand red and white chequered shirts had converged from all directions on the central square, like a giant rippling tablecloth.A big screen was set up in the middle of the square named after a 19th-century rebel nobleman, Ban Jelacic, who sat atop a bronze horse with a sideways view of the main screen as a folk band shouted out an anthem boiling over with defiance.From high above the square, the words “We’re going for the win, no surrender” shone down from an illuminated billboard through the smoke of dozens of red flares. Then 10 minutes before kick-off in Moscow, the storm that had been threatening all afternoon broke open and soaked the crowd in an instant. That was nothing like the dampener that came five minutes into the game. Kieran Trippier’s goal for England spread silence across the square and through the streets of the city.It took a good 10 minutes for the noise to resume and for hope to return, although the rain kept falling on Ban Jelacic, running in streams off the side of his mount. The human tablecloth was sodden but way past caring.When Ivan Perisic’s equaliser came, the centre of Zagreb exploded with another fusillade of flares, turning the air above a volcanic red. And that was a mere salvo compared with the reaction to Mario Mandzukic’s winner in the extra time.That Croatia were in the semi-finals at all was a victory over demographic and economic odds. This small, horseshoe-shapped country is gradually emerging from economic crisis but is mired in political problems and has a small under-resourced league.“Imagine if Croatian football had England’s money!” the manager, Zlatko Dalic, had said after beating Russia in the quarter-finals. The last time such a small country made it to a World Cup was Uruguay in 1950, and Uruguay went on to win.“It never thought this would happen. It’s amazing,” said Lucia Pupic, a 19‑year-old student wandering euphoric through the streets around the square with a flag‑draped cluster of friends. “It feels like a dream.”Her companion Filip Culibrk insists he never had any doubts. “We believed from the very beginning,” he said. “We have passion in everything we do, and this is what we are showing the world.”At the final whistle, much of the city’s population not already in the streets emptied out of their houses and apartment blocks into a rolling party. They hung out of car windows and sun roofs waving flags while the drivers leaned on their horns. The tram drivers draped Croatia team shirts on their grills and edged their way through the delirious traffic jams.Somewhere in the middle of it, some ingenious entrepreneur rigged up a spit on the back of his car and was handing out slices of roast lamb and shot glasses of plum brandy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f0b34451486dec71bacee0433c8b14897fd9f4/0_141_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7394f67f58b64286e9a6dfcb16cc291","title":"france into the final as destiny calls for england world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France becoming the first finalist of the 2018 World Cup, a Thibaut Courtois post-match meltdown, England’s hopes, dreams and fears, Cristiano Ronaldo’s move and Welsh nightmares."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff679e8476f455dc8470b924c19741e38d1decc/0_0_3907_2718/master/3907.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c470bb948c4ade8f61780cbdd7a136a 660w","title":"world cup 2018 semi final croatia v england live","story":"England took the lead and dared to dream ... but experienced opponents eventually won the dayRead the latest reaction from Martha Kelner:More from Stuart James, right here. As the dust begins to settle, Luka Modric has his say. Ouch. Despite England’s exit, Sunday’s final is all set to be a cracker. Here’s David Hytner’s lowdown on what is means for Paul Pogba and France.And with that, it’s time my time on this MBM comes to a close. It’s been emotional. For a while back there, England looked in complete control, and a first World Cup final since 1966 seemed their destiny, theirs for the taking. But experienced opponents ground them down, and in the end Croatia were deserved victors. England will pick themselves up again after a heroic campaign that totally outstripped expectation they’ll play Belgium in the third-place play-off on Saturday. Croatia meanwhile wearily move on to a meeting in the final with France. Can they become the smallest country to win the World Cup since Uruguay in 1950? It’s going to be fun finding out on Sunday.Stay tuned on this liveblog for more reaction from Barney Ronay, Martha Kelner and Dominic Fifield, plus player ratings from Stuart James, and the latest quotes from Gareth Southgate and the players. Thanks for reading, wherever you are in the world: nighty night and sweet dreams!Despite the disappointing scoreline, there will be plenty of England fans who wouldn’t have missed the game for the world. Here’s the story of their last-minute race to Russia.So on Saturday afternoon, England now face Belgium in the one match no footballer wants to play in: the third-place play-off at the World Cup. There’s plenty to play for: should England win, it’ll be their second-best finish at international football’s premier tournament: they were beaten by Italy in 1990 and ended up fourth.Also, there’s the small matter of the Golden Boot. It won’t be uppermost in his mind right now, but the captain wants that shiny shoe! He’s on six goals, two ahead of Romelu Lukaku. If the Belgian doesn’t notch at least a couple, Kane will almost certainly have the Boot to himself ... unless Kylian Mbappe or Antoine Griezmann become only the second player in history to score a World Cup final hat-trick, after Geoff Hurst.It’s not what any England fan wanted at the start of the day ... but it’s something. It’ll feel better come Saturday, promise.The mightily impressive Jordan Pickford talks. “It was an experience. Maybe we went ahead to early. But we needed that next goal to kill off the tie. We had some good chances, but didn’t put them away. They have some top-quality players, which showed in the second half. Maybe it was a high kick on Kyle Walker for their first goal? But you can’t look back, we showed pride and passion. The fans were great. As a nation we’ve come far, and hopefully it’s the start of a good future.”It was like watching a beautiful painting being ripped up in front of your eyes. England’s dream of making it to their first World Cup final for more than a quarter of a century was over and in those desolate moments after the final whistle, as the losing players wandered aimlessly around the pitch, almost zombie-like in their trance, it was impossible not to wonder whether there will be a lifetime of regret.A solemn but proud Gareth Southgate speaks! “In the first half we were really good, and could have had another. We had chances. There was a spell in the second half when they got the goal and their tails were up, we had to weather the storm. Possibly at that moment, we were hanging on a bit. Great credit, in extra time we got back into the game and showed some more composure. The biggest thing is our supporters at the end, and their reaction. That tells you what the players have given, not just tonight but over the period. I can’t ask any more. Knockout football is fine margins. When you have spells, you have to make them count we probably needed that second goal. We’ve come an incredible long way in a short space of time. We are probably beyond where we thought we might be able to go. So tonight we weren’t quite there, but the team will be stronger for that.”The England fans are still in the Luzhniki. They’re in buoyant mood, despite their disappointment, and are currently belting out a fine karaoke rendition of Don’t Look Back In Anger by Oasis. Will that chase Three Lions up the charts this weekend too? It’ll be 1996 on feedback loop. This has to stop if there’s a Kula Shaker revival, though.Post-match chat: “We dared to dream,” begins Kyle Green. “Maybe we can dream again in the future. It doesn’t hurt any less though. This is my tenth tournament with England. I’m very proud still but it’s going to be a rough rest of the night.”“For being in the supposed easy half of the draw, Croatia had to work their unmentionables off to get to the final,” writes Kári Tulinius. “Three very intense games, all going to extra time. France will be happy to face exhausted opponents, but Croatia have shown that they never give up and have always found a way.”“Watching on Dutch TV, they were quite unequivocal that Croatia deserved the victory and were several gears above the English,” reports Ali Houston. “That’s the polite version anyway. They were most, uh, constructive, in their criticism.” “Got to give Croatia props for attacking to the final second,” says Zafar Sobhan. “None of this dribbling the ball to the corner flag rubbish.”And a defiant word from Hubert O’Hearn: “It’s coming home ... soon.”And now a full-time dispatch from Kevin Rawlinson at the Hyde Park shindig.“It’s like the Olympics again.” There was a feeling of high optimism in Hyde Park, where new fans mixed with the more established, as kick-off approached. By the time the night was over, that was replaced by silent resignation.As Hyde Park filled up early on Wednesday evening, the Lightning Seeds had got the crowd going with a live rendition of Three Lions on the main stage. At that point, “it was coming home”.Will Prior, one of the tens of thousands of fans who had made his way to central London for the match, didn’t think England would get the job done in normal time. After a 0-0 draw, he saw them doing it on penalties.“I can’t handle penalties,” says Charlotte Garside, 29. She didn’t have to. That was almost crueler.Neither was really old enough to remember England’s last World Cup semi-final appearance. Each admitted they wouldn’t have been interested if they were. They were some of those people in the country who had been energised by England’s performance so far.“I just think everybody is here for the atmosphere. People normally have no hope … we’ve got fresh blood this year,” said Garside. Her prediction had been: 3-2 after extra time, following a 2-2 draw.Max Kennedy, 21, was not even old enough to remember England’s more recent semi-final appearance - in the 1996 European Championship - the first time it was said to be coming home. He believes the festival-like atmosphere was far better than watching the match in a packed pub. “You can tell everyone is just on it.”Eamonn Power and his friends could remember 1990. They said they did not see much optimism on the streets pre-match. “You don’t see so many England flags,” said David Dickson. That was, they said, until they got into Hyde Park, where they watched the match with 50,000 similarly optimistic fans.The fact Kennedy had never seen England get this far perhaps his pre-match optimism more surprising: 3-1 England, he said just before kick-off. Kane to score two. Within 10 minutes, England would be one up and thousands of plastic pint glasses would be emptied into the evening air – quite a feat at £6-a-pint.Everything seemed to looking up at that point. The sun was shining and England were heading into the World Cup final to play France. Soon after half-time, however, the smiling faces were creased with worry. Croatia had equalised and the sun had sunk behind the trees. Soon, it would be gone altogether.A deflated Harry Kane speaks. “It’s tough. We’re gutted, you know. We worked so hard. The fans were amazing. It was a tough game, a 50-50 game. I’m sure there was stuff we could have done better, but we worked as hard as we could. It hurts, it’ll hurt for a while, but we can hold our heads up high. It was a fantastic journey, we got further than anyone thought we could, we’ve just got to learn from it. We created some good chances, being 1-0 up. Maybe we dropped too deep at times. In big games, it’s small margins. There’s a lot we could have done better, but they played well. It’s been great to get to this stage, but we wanted to go on and win it. But we’ve fallen a bit short. It just hurts. It shows we can win knockout games the next stage is to go one further. We’ve got to dust ourselves down and go again in a couple of years.”The greatest thing about this England campaign? There can be no scapegoats. Because every single player has been magnificent in their own way. And so it’s that time to give the players your ratings. Tens all round? C’mon, spread the love!Sorry, I’ve been wittering ... here’s our on-the-whistle match report.Gareth Southgate is a class act. Ever the gentleman, he congratulates Zlatko Dalic, a hug and a hand clasp, and consoles his players. An arm around Kane, and a word in his ear. A gentle hand to lift Young from the floor. He’s obviously coping with feelings of crushing disappointment himself, but as ever, retains the demeanour of a statesman. He’s done England proud.England’s players collapse to the floor. You know exactly how they feel. Rashford sobs into the turf. Lingard looks distraught too. Maguire stunned. Alli with his head in his hands. Football’s not coming home after all. But two things: England have been magnificent tonight, and this is a run that will echo down the ages. Heroes all. Croatia meanwhile, after being run ragged in the first half, were the better team for the rest of the match and deservedly make it to the final. Commiserations to England’s heroic young squad ... but congratulations to Croatia!The free kick’s no good. Floated in. The man-of-the-match Perisic races off with the ball ... and the English dream is over. Croatia will play France in the 2018 World Cup final!ET 30 min +4: England will have one last set piece to save themselves! Alli tries to burst down the left. Badelj stops him, but only by handling! England load the box. Rashford takes!ET 30 min +3: Perisic romps down the left. Crosses. Pickford claims and launches long but can’t find anyone.ET 30 min +2: After a tussle for the ball, Alli gathers Rakitic’s shirt into his fist, in the old-school cartoon style. Again, it nearly descends into saloon-style shenanigans, but the ref snuffs it out. Dier hoists long but Subasic claims.ET 30 min +1: Rakitic and Perisic meander down the left. The clock ticks on. There are now three minutes for England to save their World Cup dream.ET 30 min: Croatia triangulate nicely down the right. Suddenly Kramaric is romping into the box! He’s got Perisic free in the middle, but decides to go for the top right. He only ripples the side netting. There will be four minutes of added time.ET 29 min: Modric is replaced by Badelj.ET 28 min: Trippier can’t continue. He’s being helped off. Meanwhile on the field, the ten men of England win a free kick down the left, Alli fouled. England load the box. Rashford floats it into the mixer. The ball flicks off Lovren’s head, but the ref thinks it’s come off Maguire. Goal kick.ET 26 min: Meanwhile Trippier limps off with a groin complaint. He looks in a bad way. England will defend the corner with ten men. Perisic has a crack from distance. Pickford mishandles, but gathers ... and is barged by an over-enthusiastic Vida. Free kick. For a second it looks like kicking off, but the referee is over quickly, and to be honest, Pickford just wants to get on with it.ET 25 min: Pivaric and Rakitic combine well down the left, earning a corner. Before it can be taken, Mandzukic is replaced by Corluka. The big striker takes his own sweet time to leave the field of play, and the referee performs the international mime for “I’m adding on some time, son.”ET 23 min: Rashford hoists in from the left, hoping to find Alli. But Subasic is out quickly to spring high and claim.ET 22 min: Gareth Southgate rolls the dice for the last time, replacing Walker with Vardy. Rashford races down the left and lifts a cross into the box. But there’s nobody in white nearby. Modric clears calmly.ET 20 min: A fine finish by Mandzukic, though it was more sleepy defending by England. This is the first time they’ve fallen behind on their Russian adventure. Can they rescue themselves at the death?England fail to clear a high ball down the left. Perisic beats Trippier to a header to the left of the D. Mandzukic meets the dropping ball, and flashes an unstoppable low shot across Pickford and into the bottom right.ET 18 min: Croatia take it quickly. England are snoozing. Brozovic barrels down the inside-left channel into acres of space. He’s in the area and meets the ball ... but blazes it high and wide left. England breathe again, because that was poor defending.ET 17 min: Croatia are hogging the ball in the early stages of this final period. Perisic, who has been excellent tonight, works his way down the left and wins a corner.And we’re off again! Again! Croatia get the ball rolling. Goodness knows how this final period will pan out. We’re 15 minutes away from penalty kicks just saying.The corner leads to nothing. Modric faffs about on the left, and that’s that for the first half of extra time. That was an outstanding save by Pickford, who is unquestionably one of England’s players of the tournament. If not the England player of the tournament, Kane’s goals and all. Mandzukic is still walking very gingerly.ET 15 min +2: Then Perisic, deep on the left, curls low for Mandzukic, on the edge of the six-yard box. Pickford comes out bravely to put the striker off: he star jumps and Mandzukic’s effort is deflected wide and high. What a save! But he’s also crumped Mandzukic in his trouser arrangement with his knee. So there’s a bit of time for the striker to catch his breath before the corner’s taken.ET 15 min +1: There will be two minutes added to this period. In the first, Perisic is sent scampering into space down the left. He pulls one back for Kramaric, who hits first time. But his shot is blocked.ET 15 min: The game has slowed to walking pace now. A mixture of exhaustion and nervous tension.ET 13 min: Rose has been dangerous since his introduction. He makes good ground down the left, and his fizzing cross is well dealt with by Lovren. England have regained the initiative, after seriously rocking during that second half.ET 12 min: Croatia’s free kick is a waste of time.ET 11 min: England have been the better team since the start of extra time. But then Croatia launch pretty much their first attack of the period. Vrsaljko races down the right. Rashford slides in. No contact, but it’s a free kick anyway. Before that can be taken, Rebic is replaced by the in-form Kramaric.ET 9 min: Trippier’s ball flashes onto the head of Stones, 12 yards out and level with the right-hand post. Stones guides his header towards the top left. It’s going in, but Vrsaljko is on the line and clears! So close!ET 8 min: Dier is immediately into the action, earning a corner with a speculative shot from distance. Trippier will take, out on the right.ET 7 min: Trippier chips the free kick into the area, towards Maguire. But now it’s a free kick for Croatia, Henderson having knocked Mandzukic over. And that’s Henderson’s evening over: he’s replaced by Dier.ET 6 min: Rose goes skittering at pace down the middle. Rebic slides in from behind and picks up a yellow card. The free kick is central, and a good 35 yards out. Here’s Gary Byrne: “Regardless of the result, France are absolutely loving this.”ET 4 min: England are seeing more of the ball. You’d think Croatia - older, and with an extra period of half time in their legs - could struggle if this keeps up. Strinic goes down, feeling his groin. It looks as though he’ll be hooked for Pivaric ... though he’s taking an age to traipse off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0073ae6d89858ae8f28f4082fe9cf63f8314e7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4823aa293b457f603de5ae7e9c337bd8","title":"golden boot standings top scorers for russia 2018 world cup","story":"The first official Fifa World Cup award for the player to score the most goals in the competition went to Paolo Rossi in 1982.

At 20 years old, he went straight from the show to a ridiculously charming turn as a judge on Bake Off: The Professionals. It didn’t revolutionise the genre – same suspense-building piano music, used exclusively and perhaps invented for competitive cooking, same high tensions generated by the composition of an egg – but it did revolutionise the potential of that genre. Charles has a face of such open-hearted admiration that it takes you straight back to first principles: this isn’t a game! Some of this stuff is really delicious!He is now publishing Cheeky Treats, a gly, Technicolor, many-faceted recipe book, whose title completely underplays the intricacy of its ideas. It is distinguished not by the two kilos of icing sugar in the Football Cake (and that’s just the buttercream!), nor the very simple, incredibly effective, domino pattern on his salted millionaire dominoes, nor his vertiginous layering or moments of French patisserie perfectionism, but by the joie de vivre conveyed by all those things, and the rest. “I think I’m a nice person,” he says, in his publisher’s office in central London, “regardless of the cake. I don’t like upsetting people. I just like making people happy. I thought cake was the best way.” Here, then, are his top baking tips.By the age of 15, “I could do cupcakes, cakes to a certain standard, I dabbled in pastry and bread. I did biscuits from time to time. I was solid.” Already, Charles’s friends had christened him Cake Boy, a nickname that stuck throughout his time on Bake Off.Charles went on to study drama at Goldsmiths, University of London two years ago, and will graduate this coming winter. “Over that summer between school and uni, that’s when I developed the most. That’s when I started to do chocolate work, tier cakes. If you make a four-layer cake, there is some kind of drama, you’ve got all this buttercream, and you’re like: ‘What’s inside? What’s inside?’ So there’s suspense there. There are more similarities between baking and drama than people think.”I am sceptical about the suspense – you are more or less assured that, underneath the icing, there will be cake – but no one could deny the impact of, say, his chequer cake, regally tall and plush. To those mystified by how you could fit it in your mouth: “You’ve just got to pace yourself, and enjoy it.”Mother’s day 2016 and Charles wanted to spring some doughnuts on his mother. Although a kitchen enthusiast herself, they didn’t bake together throughout childhood. “I was fixated on cake, I treated everything like a cake,” he says. Without a deep-fat fryer or any experience of proving dough, failure – burnt on the outside, raw on the inside, the texture of a padded cell if you brought yourself to eat it – was inevitable. “I did think: ‘Shall I leave this? Maybe it’s not my thing’. But it’s not in me to do that, so I just finessed it and finessed it. And the day I just bagged it was an amazing experience. But it took me months.”Charles still lives with him mum and his sister, and has a brother, too. He mentions his dad in passing – he used to take him to play football on the other side of London – but is extremely reticent about his family. The most detail you’ll get is about how many burners the oven has (six). His mum, he says sphinxishly, works in an office. Is it a secret, what she does, or have you just not asked? He smiles: “It’s definitely an office.”Goldsmiths, says Charles, was a haven of enthusiasts: no such thing as too experimental, even if that meant taking on a life-consuming TV commitment partway through a term. “They were, like: ‘Do what you have to do, as long as you come back to uni.’” When he finished Bake Off, placing fifth, he returned with three weeks to do his third-year project, a monologue he’d written himself, called The Metaphorical Meanings of Buttercream. “If I was going to go the easy route, it would have been clowning, because I’m apparently a very animated person. But I thought: ‘No, let me just test myself and find a deeper meaning with this piece.’ Most of the time, I’m mad positive, and when you’re really positive and hyper, people think you don’t think about things. So when I did show that level of intelligence, they were like: ‘Woah, he is a deeper brother.’” This is a motto borrowed from one of Charles’s baking idols, Christina Tosi, the US baking entrepreneur behind Milk Bar, and star of a Netflix Chef’s Table. “Because she comes from such a humble background, and her baking is still so humble, she stays true to herself through baking even though she’s on this massive scale now. That’s why people watch other people cook the interplay between the character and what they’re making. When something goes wrong, or when something’s good, people watching it really feel it.”Bake Off had been Charles’s dream since school, but even when he applied and got through, he thought it was probably a trial run. “If you’re not surprised to get on, you’re not human. It’s an audition process, there are so many stages, I just kept thinking: ‘If I get to this stage, that’ll be cool, I’ll go back next year. Oh, I’m through to the next stage.’ I cherished every single moment.” During his time as a contestant, Charles insists he had no rivals, “no competitive beef with anyone in that tent”, his worst and only enemy being himself. “I always want to do well, and sometimes getting up in my own head could be to the detriment of that. So I was constantly thinking: ‘You can do this, so shut up.’”Charles’s baking life hasn’t been without its flaws: one time he made a custard tart in a too-hot oven, and ended up with a beautiful looking pastry shell full of scrambled egg. “I haven’t had any training in it. It’s like baking instinct. It’s like Messi and Ronaldo, that’s why they’re so clearly above everyone else. You can have training but you have to have that extra sauce or that extra belief in what you do. I’m not calling myself Messi, by the way.”Cheeky Treats: 70 Brilliant Bakes and Cakes by Liam Charles is out on 12 July, available for £17 at the  Bookshop.

He won’t let me talk or sit with any of my co-workers I am not allowed to move from my seat I feel like I am in solitary confinement. We have had conversations about our issues and I have tried coming up with solutions, but he has put them all down. It used to be fun to come into work but now I hate it and am miserable.

I dream about those tacos.”As with all the best dishes, there’s some debate about its origins, with the city of Ensenada and the town of San Felipe both claiming paternity: the first credits Japanese migrants for the crispy, tempura-style fish, and the latter the local climate, which apparently is only tolerable on a regular diet of mustardy beer batter. One serves the fish in corn tortillas, the other in corn or wheat, one fries in oil, the other lard, one adds guacamole and ketchup – and that’s before you even get to the choice of fish or salad.Meghan herself favours a distinctly Californian-style grilled version with peppers and onions – and, 5,000 miles away, we’re even less bound by local loyalties. So, if you happen to find yourself stuck in a damp, grey city more into fish and chips than fish tacos, what’s the best way to make them at home?Unsurprisingly, the fish found in the ocean off Baja California bear scant resemblance to those in my local fishmongers. Mexican expert Rick Bayless says that “practically any” boneless skinless fish fillets will work (Markle enjoys salmon), but Bayless likes “larger-flake, lighter-flavor fish best”. His sea bass, J Kenji López-Alt’s hake and Rick Stein’s cod, from his book The Road to Mexico, are easy enough to source, but I use monkfish and stone bass in place of the more exotic mahi mahi and flounder. Hake and both varieties of bass prove a little soft for our liking, but monkfish and cod work brilliantly, being firm enough to hold their shape, and juicy enough to withstand the rigours of deep-frying: look for cod or similar white fish cheeks, which are not only a little cheaper than steaks, but are also already conveniently cut to size.Whatever fish you use, once it’s battered and deep-fried, it should begin to look a bit more familiar – unless you go down the American route. Sam Anguiano of LA’s Pink Taco rubs his fish with Old Bay seasoning and grills it over fresh mesquite for the “ultimate fresh flavour” – in the absence of mesquite, I go for a hot griddle pan. They’re delicious, as are Sam Sifton’s seasoned-flour versions, shallow fried in oil and butter, but texturally neither can compete with the crunch of hot batter: as López-Alt wisely observes, “if there’s any cooking method in the world that can make all foods taste great, it’s deep-frying”. (I don’t try frying them in lard, as I can’t get hold of any free-range stuff in time, but if you have a good extraction system, from my extensive experience with fish fried in beef dripping, I’d recommend it.) If you’d like a healthier version, then by all means grill them … but know you’ll be missing out.Although Stein is clearly a man who knows how to batter a fish (flour, salt, baking powder and ice-cold beer), his simple, rather British version can’t compete with the spicy tang of Bayless and López-Alt’s more highly seasoned recipes. Yellow mustard is apparently de rigeur in Baja California, but I can’t help thinking the more fiery English sort would be even better. López Alt adds paprika, and Sifton chilli powder, while Bayless goes for Mexican oregano and chicken stock, which gives his batter a wonderfully savoury flavour, although vegetable would do for pescatarians. Any extra chilli feels unnecessary given the accompaniments, and López-Alt’s egg and double flouring process gives his batter a crunchy, fried-chicken-like solidity which, while undoubtedly pleasing to eat, doesn’t prove quite as popular as Bayless and Stein’s lighter, crisper versions, possibly because they’re easier to overeat.You could just dollop on sour cream and chilli sauce and be done with it, but most of the recipes call for homemade “crema” made from a mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise, with Stein thinning it with lime juice and Bayless milk, while López-Alt sticks with mayonnaise mixed with sriracha, and Anguiano sour cream mixed with Louisiana hot sauce. I find the more liquid versions hard to keep in the taco, but López-Alt’s is a little too solid for me to drizzle. Souped-up sour cream with your own favourite brand of chilli-based condiment will do the job: although it’s a long way from home, López-Alt’s sriracha gives an addictively savoury flavour, and Stein and Sifton’s chipotle chillies in adobo sauce provide a more complex smokiness. Even good old Tabasco works in a pinch.Although salsa isn’t mandatory, it does give extra freshness to the dish, especially if, like Stein and Sifton, you make your own pico de gallo from tomatoes, onion, coriander and chilli, mixed with a generous amount of lime juice and salt. A salad of raw chopped cabbage is non-negotiable, however: we like the crunch of Stein’s white version, but red or green would do just as well. Anguiano also includes a cucumber slaw with red onion and serrano pepper dressed with orange, lemon and lime juice: nice on the side, but too wet for my liking in a taco.Faced with a dearth of decent fruit, López-Alt uses quick pickled red onions instead of the tomatoes he says are typically added to fish tacos in California for their “brightness and acidity”. Although we are now in peak tomato season, I’d urge you to make a batch of his onions anyway. They’re incredible. His avocados are another optional extra: you don’t need them, but I do like the creamy, squidgy texture they bring to the party – and if a taco isn’t too full to pick up, surely you’re not doing it right.You can use corn or flour – but I don’t know why you’d go for the latter when corn tortillas have so much more flavour. They’re still oddly hard to track down in this country, but if you don’t live near a stockist, then buy them online. They freeze very well, which means you’re only ever a few ingredients away from taco-based bliss: now with the seal of royal approval.4 ripe tomatoes½ small red onion1 jalapeño chilli1 small bunch corianderJuice of 1½ limes¼ tsp salt120ml sour cream2 tbsp chilli sauce, plus extra to serve½ white, green or red cabbage1 avocado, optional200g plain flour¼ tsp salt½ tsp baking powder1 tsp mustard powder1 tsp chicken or vegetable stock cube or powder300ml cold lagerNeutral oil, for frying8 corn tortillas400g cod cheeks, or other firm, white fish, cut into stripsDeseed and dice the tomatoes, and put in a bowl.

Winkleman receives a fifth of the pay of the best-paid man, sports presenter Gary Lineker, who receives £1.75m. Winkleman ranks 13th in the top 20, with Feltz 15th equal.The BBC has increased transparency this year by narrowing the pay bands it reports from £50,000 to £10,000. The increase in the number of women making the list comes as big-name stars have agreed to significant pay cuts, helping the corporation in its effort bridge the male-female chasm in pay.He was paid between £600,000 and £650,000. This has now been reduced to between £400,000 to £410,000, with the BBC saying that next year it will fall to “below” £300,000.Radio 5 Live’s Nicky Campbell will see his pay drop from £410,000 to £420,000 to “below” £350,000 by next March, with a further cut after that. And the remuneration of BBC News presenter Huw Edwards, whose pay was between £550,000 and £559,000, will fall to “well below” £500,000 by next year and “continue to fall”.Overall the BBC spent almost £19m on its 64 best-paid on-air stars.The efforts to close the gender pay gap at the BBC will result in the total number of on-air stars paid more than £150,000 rising by almost a fifth from 58 to 69 by 1 April 2019.Despite the progress, critics argue that the BBC has, if anything, become less transparent since spinning off its TV production arm, which makes shows such as EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing, and merging it with BBC Worldwide.A string of top earners including BBC One Show presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones (the second best-paid female BBC star), DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles and Strictly’s Tess Daly have disappeared from the list. This is because programmes they were paid for are now produced by the newly merged entity, BBC Studios. It is classed as a commercial entity and does not publish how much it pays people.As a result, while last year’s list of the BBC’s top-paid stars featured 96 names, this year that number has shrunk to 69. In addition, the reduction of some stars’ pay may be smaller than it appears. Humphrys’ job fronting Mastermind is now paid by BBC Studios, for instance, and so is not disclosed.Hall said excluding BBC Studios pay figures had done the corporation “no favours” as it actually reduced the number of women, and higher-earning women, in the list, and that including them would have improved its gender and salary mix.“We are not hiding anything,” said Hall. “Our public service side is going to degrees of transparency we have never gone before.”The BBC’s list also only counts remuneration directly paid from the BBC licence fee. This means it does not include payments to staff through independent production companies that make programmes for the BBC, or payments from BBC Worldwide.As a result, the list still does not include stars such as Sherlock’s Benedict Cumberbatch, Question Time’s David Dimbleby, Have I Got News For You’s Ian Hislop, Sir David Attenborough or Alan Sugar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

You’ve ’ad yer bingo. Now give the turn a go.”Thus, in 1964, frustrated by going on after the bingo and a struggling musician’s life in general, he sat on nearby Widnes station and penned Homeward Bound, a song about yearning to be off the road, which, ironically, is among the many that have kept him on it ever since. Fifty-four years on, he performs it with spooky emotional intensity for the last time in the region. When his Homeward Bound farewell tour reaches a grand finale in his childhood New York borough of Queens on 22 September, he will bring the curtain down on six decades as a touring artist.In the intervening years, this tiny man – all of 5ft 3in – has become a giant of popular music: half of Simon and Garfunkel, a mega-selling solo artist and a world-music pioneer. Now 76, he looks slightly frail as he walks on and there is a slight tremor in his voice, but he soon finds his vocal range and even some enviably natty dance steps, as if performing these songs again have revitalised his life force. He sings 27 of them in 140 minutes, careering through decades and around the globe, from Widnes, Cheshire, to Kingston, Jamaica (where he recorded the sublime Mother and Child Reunion, possibly the first white reggae track), to Salvador, Brazil (the percussive and brassy The Obvious Child), to five selections from 1986’s Graceland, which brought African rhythms to western pop.Simon reveals that after initial anxiety about stopping touring, he was finding the thought of various possibilities liberating, and he could do worse than become an educator or raconteur. Stories come thick and fast: how he wrote songs aged 13 amid the rock’n’roll explosion how things started to happen when he traded his electric guitar for an acoustic, moved to England and met influential folkies such as Martin Carthy. He reveals that the title of Rene and Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After the War was inspired by a photo caption, and that the kid who got on the bus in America pops up again in Rewrite, working in a gas station: a metaphor for the American dream delivered as an aside. He speaks of “repossessing” his song Bridge Over Troubled Water from “Artie” (the golden-tonsilled Garfunkel, who sang the 1970 original to such devastating effect) as one might a car. Simon’s delivers this pop colossus in his slightly more conversational style, merely song number 11 in this set. He has never rested unduly on his laurels, though, and with his 14-strong band, he reinvents old songs and peppers the set with new ones – references include global warming, inequality, sub-bass and Jay-Z. Still, the final 10 songs form a breathtaking rummage in his top drawer, from a lithe and funky Late in the Evening to a celebratory, celestial segue of Graceland’s Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes into You Can Call Me Al that has the arena dancing. But emotion wells as the crowd act as an impromptu choir for a magical The Boxer. The line “I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains” could be Simon’s musical epitaph, but he departs with The Sound of Silence, Simon and Garfunkel’s first hit from 1965. But there is no hush, only rapture, as the crowd rise to honour one of the very best.• This article was updated on 11 July to amend a misquoted lyric: Simon sings “fighter” rather than “fire” in The Boxer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeaa9429ab6d762c578cbbee8c7e8863d2bf7f65/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2d1f5dc2fd6f1569f90b35da42219971 1320w","title":"elite schools always find ways to boost grades","story":"It would appear that Barnaby Lenon, featured in Peter Wilby’s article (From Harrow to hairdressing: elite school head takes a new direction, 10 July), has not explored the fundamental problem – the school curriculum is geared towards university entrance. Having spent 30 years of my life working in the further education sector and a further 15 years as a volunteer working with young offenders, I have found that the school experience of many of the young people in question who are made to follow an academic programme does not leave them with an enthusiasm for learning, just a feeling of failure in not achieving a higher grade, and a general boredom with the whole process.It is irrelevant whether “T-levels” will work or not, the possible recruits need to see their relevance, both in terms of job prospects and a learning process that is not going to bore them so much that they leave. Some years ago an act was passed that made it compulsory for students up to the age of 18 to be in some kind of education, training or employment. It would be most interesting to learn both what the take-up rate is, and the drop-out rate. For these young people, and adults also venturing into post-school education, it is not just what they are required to learn, but how they learn, and too little attention is paid by schools and the government to this issue.David SelbySouth Wonston, Hampshire• With the independent sector continuing to use IGCSEs, it is little wonder that concerns have been reignited “among some heads that the state-private ide will widen” (The saga of the IGCSE: if it’s good enough for Eton, why not for my local school?, 10 July). “Competing equally for the best university places” is clearly a government policy that is dead in the water.A-levels are also being sidelined by many private and high-achieving state schools, which opt instead for Pre-U examinations. These are set and marked by teachers in the independent sector, are not regulated like other exams by the Joint Council for Qualifications, and, like IGCSEs, are run by Cambridge Assessment they first came to light with last year’s cheating scandal (Leading public school suspends teacher over exam cheating claims, 29 August 2017).Looks like IGCSEs are not the only “easier exams” being taken by private schools “to boost their chances of top grades and places at the best universities”.Bernie EvansLiverpool• Hats off to the parents of St Olave’s and the  journalists who unearthed the scandal of academic cleansing in posh sixth forms (Inquiry condemns school that barred A-level pupils, 11 July). I trust they are considering suing the former superhead for personal injury to young people resulting from his dereliction of duty of care. Cutting off a student’s progress halfway through a course because of perceived performance issues is clearly immoral. A-levels don’t finish in year 12. Senior staff and governors at the school were also complicit and spineless in not challenging their much-admired supremo. But they were happy enough with the super results and league table position for long enough. I wonder how widespread your readers think this problem is. Is it endemic at university\u0026nbsplevel, for example?Unfortunately, I once worked with a superhead: he told me he was “charismatic”. I laughed and thought “so was Jesus … and Adolf Hitler”.

Emma’s Diary can make representations to the ICO to reduce the fine before it makes a final decision on the matter.The company describes itself as “one of the UK’s leading baby clubs for mums-to-be, providing expert advice on every aspect of pregnancy and childcare” and claims to be “the most widely circulated mother-and-baby publication”, distributing 870,000 copies each year. It said it denied some of the ICO’s allegations.The company works with organisations including the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Midwives to reach new and expectant mothers. In exchange for registering with the company, mothers receive Argos vouchers and various free gifts as well as information throughout pregnancy.On Tuesday, the deputy information commissioner, Steve Wood, said the ICO had “really significant concerns about how Emma’s Diary was gathering the data, particularly involving mothers who were in hospital”.In May 2017, one month ahead of the general election, Emma’s Diary – the trading name of Lifecycle Marketing (Mother and Baby) Ltd – provided more than 1m records to the data broking firm Experian, according to the ICO’s notice.For each of the records Emma’s Diary supplied the mother’s name, her address, the date of birth of the mother and child, and how many children under five were present in the home. Experian then loaded the records into a database for the Labour party to use in a direct marketing mail campaign for the 2017 general election. The information was used in the constituencies for 106 parliamentary seats, according to the ICO notice.Experian deleted the records following the 2017 general election. There is no suggestion of any breach of data protection legislation by Experian or the Labour party.Emma’s Diary told the ICO that usage of mothers’ data was fully outlined in its privacy policy at the time. However, the ICO disagreed on the basis that the privacy policy contained no mention of selling data for political purposes.The company later amended its privacy policy to make explicit the potential for customer data to be sold for political purposes, according to the ICO notice.The ICO said the disclosure “risked causing distress to some affected data subjects”, and that any of the mothers could “reasonably infer that the Labour party was subjecting her to a degree of profiling for political ends and without her knowledge”.The commission also found that it was highly likely that affected iniduals would be distressed that their children’s personal data had been fed into a party political database without their consent.In mitigation the ICO said this was the first time Emma’s Diary had shared data with any political party and that the fine would likely have a financial and reputational impact on the company.Publication of the notice follows the announcement yesterday that the ICO intended to fine Facebook £500,000 for its part in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.That fine, the largest possible under old legislation, is one of a series of enforcement actions the organisation has taken after it launched an investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes.The inquiry, launched in March 2017 following reporting in the Observer on Cambridge Analytica, has since evolved into the ICO’s largest ever investigation, with as many as 40 full-time staff. In addition to the Facebook fine and enforcement action against Cambridge Analytica, the ICO announced that it would conduct an audit of UK political parties’ data processing practices.The Labour party said it welcomed the ICO’s report and said it held data from a variety of sources.“We have neither bought nor used Emma’s Diary data since the 2017 general election and we will be reviewing our approach to acquiring data from third parties in light of the ICO’s report,” a spokesperson said.Concerns have previously been raised over how the personal data of new and expectant mothers is being obtained. Five years ago 60,000 people signed a petition calling for the government to sever a contract with Bounty over sales representatives obtaining details from women in hospital. In a statement Lifecycle Marketing said it disputed the ICO’s findings. “Lifecycle Marketing has been operating for more than 25 years with integrity,” it said. “We have always sought to fully comply with our data protection obligations, which we take extremely seriously.”It went on: “We are deeply disappointed by the ICO’s decision to publish a report including details of enforcement action intended to be taken against Lifecycle Marketing. “This includes the untrue claim that we sold data from expectant mothers to the Labour Party. Furthermore, Lifecycle has never been, nor ever will be, involved in collecting data from mothers in maternity wards as the ICO is reported to have asserted. This allegation is false, defamatory and causes serious harm to Lifecycle’s reputation.” The company said it was not given an opportunity to respond to detail of the ICO’s notice. “We look forward to working with the ICO on its ongoing investigation and will be submitting our written representations to challenge the ICO’s findings in accordance with the usual process,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fbe0cedb3d84058f201e4ed3cd92daf146b63a7/0_110_5152_3092/master/5152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=438270488fcc165db6f974dcee2ce803","title":"pmqs emily thornberry david lidlington labour v tory play off","story":"As Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are rested, subs Lidington and Thornberry get bogged down in detailIt was Theresa May’s best performance at prime minister’s questions for months. No fumbling to master the basics of language. No failing to answer questions she hadn’t even been asked. No awkward gurning or exaggerated laughter to disguise her own discomfort. Mainly because she was nowhere near the House of Commons.With the prime minister away at the Nato summit in Brussels and Jeremy Corbyn also getting the day off, the head to head between David Lidington and Emily Thornberry had much the feel of a world cup third place play-off fixture. A game that nobody much wanted and was only taking place to fulfil contractual obligations. One that would be played out at training ground pace with no hard tackles from either side.Not even blue on blue. Neither David Davis, Boris Johnson nor any of the other sulking Brexiters were going to waste their time being awkward on May’s away day. Save that for the organ grinder, not the monkey.Thornberry began well enough. Unlike Corbyn, she has some sort of comic timing and her comparison between the English football team – clear game plan and a manager whom everyone respected – and the government aka “Reservoir Dogs remade by the Chuckle Brothers” hit home. Lidington looked like a man who had just received a hospital pass and he desperately scanned the front bench for support. Nothing. None of his cabinet colleagues would look him in the eye and the Tory backbenchers were almost mute. It’s going to take a while for the Conservatives to recover from this week’s post-traumatic stress disorder.After that things went rapidly downhill, with both Thornberry and Lidington getting bogged down in the detail of the new customs arrangements that had been agreed by those members of the cabinet that hadn’t yet resigned. Something which neither of them appeared to fully understand.Which had, after all, always been the point of the agreement anyway. The facilitated customs arrangement had been facilitated to be so vague that it could mean anything to anyone. If you chose not to take back control, you were in fact taking back control of the taking back control process.“When the government publishes its white paper tomorrow,” Lidington said hesitantly. “She will see that we are taking full account of all the things we have to take account of.” He sounded as if he didn’t believe it himself, but he carried on regardless. There would be no need for any new technology to ensure a frictionless border but he was actively looking at ways in which new technology could help ensure a frictionless border.The shadow foreign secretary was understandably bemused that Schrodinger’s Brexit – a Brexit that was both there and not there – was now the government’s official policy and made the fatal error of trying to make sense of the nonsensical. Lidington just ummed and ahhed about being determined to deliver on the things that they were determined to deliver and even the Speaker lost the will to live.Normally Thornberry would only get six questions, but this time a near comatose John Bercow allowed her a seventh by mistake. Even then no one was any the wiser. The house would have been more enlightened if the Four Pot Plants had done PMQs.Not that May was having a particularly easy time of it over in Brussels, as she tried to keep her head down and avoid most of the incoming from the US president. Donald Trump appeared to have come to Nato on a pan-European insultathon. Not content with rubbishing Britain for being in turmoil, he then went for the Germans. “You’re just slaves to the Russians,” he yelled. Give him time and he’d be calling the French “surrender monkeys”. The breakfast meeting between Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and Trump had been a collector’s item of mutual contempt.Having been ignored on arrival by everyone except for a handful of hacks who asked her the usual existential questions of “What’s the point of you?” and “Why do you carry on when you’re so hopeless?”, May was eventually summoned to take part in the pre-summit photo call. By the time she arrived, there was only one space left. Next to The Donald. The one spot neither she nor anyone else wanted to be. Her face and shoulders crumpled. It was going to be a long few days with the US president."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67107feb2d473a7e1b986e1888db8ee4905dcb70/413_0_3329_1998/master/3329.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee507d3801655920c7043df1d7a7d1ac","title":"automated virtual reality therapy helps people overcome phobia of heights","story":"Scientists hope computer programme which requires no human therapist could be used to treat other mental health problemsA fear of heights could be overcome with the help of a virtual therapist, new research suggests, with experts saying the findings boost hopes virtual reality could play a key role in tackling other mental health problems.“It is just the most common type of phobia, and one we know a lot of people do not get treatment for despite it impinging on many people’s lives quite a lot,” said Daniel Freeman, professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford and first author of the research. Freeman is also the co-founder of Oxford VR, the company that was involved in the research. “What is hugely encouraging here is just the size of the treatment effects it is really very large,” he said.Freeman notes a fear of heights was the first aspect of mental health to be tackled with VR. But he says previous approaches used VR as an aid during therapy, while the new system means a trained therapist does not even need to be present.The study comes just months after the National Institute of Health Research announced it was investing £4m in virtual reality therapy for mental health problems – a project that Freeman is leading. The team are currently exploring the use of VR for conditions ranging from schizophrenia to depression, although Freeman was quick to say more skilled therapists are also needed.Writing in the Lancet Psychiatry, Freeman and colleagues report how they split 100 adults who had a phobia of heights randomly into two groups: 49 were invited to don a headset for half an hour, two or three times a week for a fortnight, while those in the other group carried on as usual with no specific treatment. In total, 47 people undertook at least one VR session and completed about four and a half sessions on average. IThe therapy involved an avatar coach carrying out an assessment before inviting the inidual to choose a floor of a virtual building and asking them to perform activities, such as rescuing a cat from a branch, to explore the thoughts behind their fears.Iniduals had their fear of heights assessed through a series of questionnaires at the start of the study, at the end of the two week therapy period, and again after another two weeks had passed.“It is better than what you would expect if you saw a therapist face to face,” Freeman said of the results. “We didn’t do a direct comparison, but if you look at the other treatment trials the results are a lot better.” The team also found the benefits were still seen two weeks after the VR therapy, and say there was little sign of side effects such as nausea from using the headsets.Freeman said that while some people might prefer to see a therapist, the results show that iniduals benefited from the VR therapy, and added that some people do not seek treatment for mental health problems because they do not want to have to talk to a therapist..However, the study had limitations, including that the drop in a fear of heights was based on a self-reported questionnaire, and it was not clear which aspects of the virtual therapy were helpful. The study also did not look at whether effects were maintained over the longer term. Dr Warren Mansell, a clinical psychologist at the University of Manchester who was not involved in the study, said he was not surprised the VR therapy proved effective, but said it was not yet clear whether it was “better” than conventional face-to-face therapy and real life exposure, or how it would be decided which approach an inidual should receive.But, Mansell added, VR is useful as it offers the potential for iniduals to carefully control the situations they are exposed to, which can be difficult in the real world but, he says, is an important aspect of such therapy.Mansell was also optimistic such technology could be useful beyond phobias. “Most people with bipolar disorder have an anxiety disorder, for example,” he said “Fear is at the root of psychosis, and if anything we need more novel solutions to help people with more idiosyncratic problems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b57ca55eb9eb4f6d76b95c5363884e0a70ff7a05/13_99_4471_2682/master/4471.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1ffd5b4c4951b8106b7037f4c22b211","title":"alex hales set to miss england odi india trent bridge","story":"Alex Hales has been the driving force behind two world‑record totals at Trent Bridge but, despite an impressive back catalogue on his home ground, he looks set to be dropped for England’s one-day series opener against India on Thursday.In a move that demonstrates the intense competition for places in Eoin Morgan’s 50-overs side Hales is expected to make way for Ben Stokes, who played in the Twenty20 defeat at Bristol on Sunday and is close to full fitness after a hamstring tear.It is a harsh, if not unexpected, blow for a batsman who during England’s last outing in Robin Hood country four weeks ago blazed 147 from 92 balls to help post the monstrous 481 for six against Australia, and two years earlier had pummelled Pakistan’s bowlers for 171 runs in the previous men’s ODI record of 444 for three.But while Hales knows Trent Bridge like the back of his hand, from the bountiful pitch to the quirky dimensions that offer a short hit over extra when batting at the Radcliffe Road End, it appears Morgan is keen to have an additional bowling option and, of course, the extra aggression and dynamism offered by Stokes in the field.Given No\u0026nbsp1 hosts No\u0026nbsp2 in the rankings in this three-match series and India’s lineup is also packed with rapacious batsmen – not least their captain, Virat Kohli, who is one-day cricket’s unrivalled best – this desire for reinforcements with the ball is understandable even if Stokes has bowled only two competitive overs since May.With another run-soaked affair on the banks of the Trent expected, there is an argument that Nottinghamshire’s Hales should still be retained on a horses-for-courses basis regardless, perhaps with a view to repeating such flexibility in the World Cup group stage fixture against Pakistan on this ground next summer.But then the fall guy in this case would probably be Joe Root. And, though he was shunted down below the blasters at No\u0026nbsp7 during the last world record here, the Test captain is still rightly viewed as the linchpin across all surfaces, with England’s rise to the top of the rankings having been built on starting each series with their strongest possible XI.These are nevertheless interesting times for Root, who on Sunday was the one to make way for Stokes in the T20 side and has only one half-century in six ODI innings this summer. When he spoke on Wednesday before what should be another sell-out occasion, the 27-year-old gave a gimlet-eyed response to questions on the topic.While England will welcome back the previously rested Mark Wood – Jake Ball, like Hales, is expected to miss out on his home ground – and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, will be resuming duties after a break, India’s attack has been depleted by Jasprit Bumrah’s finger injury and Bhuvneshwar Kumar suffering from a stiff back.Kohli’s trump cards will instead be the wrist-spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav, with the tourists eyeing a victorious scouting mission before next year’s World Cup and a return to the top of the rankings if they can do so by three games to nil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f816c124e60d8813394fdd6abfc7ffd65a76cb/0_38_5532_3319/master/5532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9cc91676ac62a2099ca38e71a889279","title":"tour de france peter sagan wins stage five simmering team sky tension","story":"Tensions at the Tour de France around Chris Froome and his Sky teammates showed little sign of abating on Wednesday. The defending champion was booed once again at the start village for stage five, and a French fan holding up a “Sky\u0026nbsp– Go Home” banner outside the\u0026nbspTeam Sky bus had it snatched out\u0026nbspof\u0026nbsphis hands by Froome’s teammate, Luke Rowe.Asked immediately afterwards by reporters about the incident, Rowe\u0026nbspdenied any involvement. “I\u0026nbspdon’t know what you mean. It wasn’t\u0026nbspme,”\u0026nbsphe said.After the finish in Quimper, however, in which Peter Sagan took his second stage win of the 2018 Tour, Rowe elaborated. “The fan had a sign that said ‘Sky – Go Home’,” he said.“When I went to sign on I rode past him, he was kind of laughing about it, I was laughing about it, he’s stood next to his son in a Team Sky jersey, and I grabbed it off him.”“It wasn’t meant to be malicious or anything,” Rowe said. “I don’t think he was too bothered.” Asked what he had done with the sign Rowe said: “It was laminated so, you know, #passonplastic – I put it straight in the\u0026nbsprecycling bin which is I think where it belongs. I don’t think I have to be sorry for anything, do I? It was no big deal – just a bit of banter.”For Team Sky their safety during the Tour remains a concern, according to Brailsford. “We’ve got young women in the team that come and support the VIPs and normally they drive around on their own, but I can’t allow that to happen in this race,” he said.But Brailsford was more conciliatory than earlier in the race. “It was blown out of proportion,” he said of his comments on Lappartient. “I was just trying to address a few points – it wasn’t meant to be insulting, it wasn’t meant to be confrontational. It was just to try and raise awareness around the safety of our riders here in France. I think the mayor’s done a\u0026nbspfantastic job in his town, as all mayors\u0026nbspare doing in their towns. I don’t want anybody to get the wrong end of\u0026nbspthe stick.”But the man ousted by Lappartient in last year’s UCI presidential elections, Brian Cookson, bemoaned the public confrontation between the two men, describing it as an “own goal”.“It is really important that all of us in positions of leadership respect each other and do not indulge in personal attacks,” Cookson said. “We have all\u0026nbspseen examples of unacceptable and\u0026nbspdangerous behaviour on the roadside. We are often a heartbeat away from disaster.”Wada later issued a statement explaining why it chose not to appeal against the UCI’s decision not to assert an anti-doping violation against Froome, saying it “was taken on the basis of a full and careful review of all explanations and supporting evidence submitted by Mr Froome in June 2018 (which the UCI shared with Wada), as well as thorough consultation with internal and external experts.”Out on the route, along the hilly and twisting roads of Brittany, the repetitive steep climbs took their toll. One of the first riders to struggle was Mark Cavendish, although he was soon joined at the back of the field by a rival sprinter, Marcel Kittel. Up at the front of the peloton, the fast finish to Quimper, which included the steep ramp of the Côte de Stang Vihan, saw the weeding out process of the overall contenders begin to\u0026nbsptake\u0026nbspshape.Bora-Hansgrohe’s Sagan had the most powerful sprint on the sinuous uphill finish, the Slovak passing rivals such as the Bahrain-Merida’s Italian rider Sonny Colbrelli and BMC’s yellow jersey wearer Greg Van Avermaet, of Belgium, to claim the 11th Tour stage win of his career. Just behind him Sky’s Colombian Egan Bernal paced his leader Froome to the line, and there were the first flashes of form from the 2014 Tour champion, Bahrain-Merida’s Vincenzo Nibali.“Everyone knew that was going to be a tricky finish today,” Froome said. “But Tom Dumoulin is the guy that stands out at the moment as he’s still quite far ahead of me. His team rode a good team time-trial and he hasn’t lost time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d8ae8e38f0e23f7e9ca1aab94c2a651d12fe856/0_279_4427_2658/master/4427.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94ed2dc317cb822dbbff5b7effd270ea","title":"the one review soho theatre london","story":"Soho theatre, LondonTuppence Middleton and John Hopkins star in Vicky Jones’s play about the sadistic games of a bored coupleIn Vicky Jones’s vicious relationship drama, originally staged in 2014, the audience never know when to laugh. Over the course of one night in one room, Jo (Tuppence Middleton) and Harry (John Hopkins), chuck jokes, insults and each other around. Their arguments are more exciting than their sex life, with Jo munching and throwing Wotsits as they watch porn together. Waiting for a text to announce that Jo’s sister has given birth, their evening is repeatedly interrupted by Kerry (Julia Sandiford), Harry’s former lover, who still has her eye fixed on him. Savage comments ricochet into the early hours of the morning and centre stage are the gaps between laughter and fear, wit and cruelty, sex and rape – mere inches apart on the red leather sofa.At first, Harry and Jo get off by challenging each other, and Kerry’s purpose is to re-equip the couple when they run out of ammo. But Harry’s aggression spills into his actions. He hurts Jo, hits her. A hand in her pants moves to her neck and doesn’t let go. Some she asks for, some she doesn’t. His control over her body feels like vengeance. But despite what most would see as domestic violence – if not sexual assault then “sexual something” as Kerry says – they settle disturbingly quickly back into intimacy and laughter.The corny soundtrack of Phantom of the Opera plays over scene changes where nothing but the clock moves. The beautiful but unnecessary luminous moon and laser-cut sitting room simply distract from the piercing dialogue and Steve Marmion’s neat direction.The One asks some valuable questions – where the boundary of assault lies and how far regret absolves you – but by focusing largely on the sadistic games of a bored middle-class couple, it limits the conversation around domestic violence.Wanting violent sex, rape fantasies and being raped are incredibly different things. An hour isn’t long enough to unpick all these issues, and instead the play throws them up in the air like the Wotsits that are caught on a tongue or peeled off a sticky leg for later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd63fa9093910bc778d6ec16ad03046514cad2c/0_108_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fed9aa293637e5e18a4a8faa3db47644","title":"from online to on the high street how one fashion brand made the move","story":"Festival-going retailer Carrie Hyndman on expanding her venture Junkbox Apparel with a store and creative space in ChesterWhen Carrie Hyndman finally set up her first bricks-and-mortar store for her adventure clothing brand, Junkbox Apparel, she did not want to lose sight of where she gained much of her inspiration – festivals. So she’s brought that creative buzz into a multi-faceted retail space.Joining up with another clothing designer, The Grunge Monkey, Hyndman launched The 2nd Floor in Chester in April. The idea was to make it a place where people could come in to get a feel for her brand, but also where creative minds could relax and be inspired. Within it, she has set up a coffee shop, a space for artists to showcase their work and an area for local musicians to play and sell records. “We feel really passionately about what we do, but also about the creative community around us. We wanted to offer that support to other people in our position,” she says.Hyndman knows many sides of the creative industry, putting her in a good place to make the space work. Not only does she sell her own clothes, but she splits her time with her band, Campfire Social, and is a keen wakeboarder and surfer. Each summer, she travels from festival to festival, sets up shop, meets new people and sells her clothes to like-minded folk.“Part of the whole idea of the brand is going out travelling and being outdoors. I don’t want to lose that,” she says. “It’s great to have a place that reflects that.”Hyndman started Junkbox Apparel as an online clothing shop in 2013, drawing on a background in retail and her jewellery design hobby. “It came from my own interests and what I wanted in my wardrobe – leisurewear for people who enjoy the outdoors.” The name she picked out with her mum, inspired by where people tend to store their accessories, in particular their costume jewellery. “You used to call that junk jewellery, hence where Junkbox came from,” she says. “It applies to what the brand is now: you chuck your stuff in a bag and you’re off.”The idea of travelling light evolved from her days of going on holiday with a different outfit packed for each day. “I hate doing that now, but I still like to look good and I like to be comfortable.” Which is why she came up with the capsule set: a few items of clothes that centre around a similar colour palette and activity that mix and match, so they are all that is needed for a weekend away. “You chuck them in a bag and you’re done,” she says.It’s a simple concept, but growing the business has been anything but smooth sailing. Hyndman believes there is “no original idea any more” – instead, building a business means carving out a niche, getting the brand name noticed, and collaborating rather than competing. “I think that encourages you to look at what you’re doing,” she says. “Looking at the competition and making it not competition, making them your peers.”“The nice thing is, I take a little bit less along to festivals now,” she says. “I used to take a clipboard, notebook, stock sheets, and loads of things like that. The stock management side of it became a little bit of hard work. Now I just take a little box with my carrier bags, my Square Reader and then my van with as much stock as I can fit into it.”Having launched The 2nd Floor in April, Hyndman has bigger plans for Junkbox Apparel. “I want to say take over the world, but we won’t be doing that any time soon – I’ve got to be realistic,” she laughs.Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ee417425ea98240e4e4de4aa6076868ba1cc52/0_204_4361_2617/master/4361.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa7c411cd91fd3a1f23630ae31bf6696","title":"us immigration family separations doj us citizens","story":"ACLU calls revelation ‘horrific’ and blames administration’s poor execution of family separation policyThe Department of Justice (DoJ) told a federal judge Tuesday that it may have mistakenly separated a father and toddler who could both be US citizens for as long as a year, in the process of enforcing the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the revelation “horrific” and blamed the administration’s poor execution of the practice of family separations.“The fact that a citizen got caught up in this mess shows just how poor the government’s record-keeping was, and this is just the latest example,” said Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.On 26 June, in a suit filed by the ACLU against the government over the separation of families at the southern border, federal judge Dana Sabraw granted a preliminary injunction requiring the reunification of children under the age of five by 10 July.In a hearing on Tuesday, just before the deadline, the DoJ was asked to account for each failed reunification of the 102 younger children in its care. It noted 27 cases where it found reunification was not currently feasible, including one “because the parent’s location has been unknown for more than a year … and records show the parent and child might be US citizens”.Previously the DoJ had only revealed that the child’s father could not be located. The ACLU and the court were only made aware that both father and child might be US citizens on Tuesday.In total the DoJ said it expected to have 38 children under five reunified by Tuesday’s 10pm PT deadline, 16 “soon thereafter” and another 20 depending on a number of conditions including whether or not parents can be located, and “if those parents request reunification”.In Tuesday’s hearing, Sabraw said that the families were improperly separated and that he would not extend the deadline, meaning that the government is technically in violation of the court order as of Tuesday night. “These are firm deadlines. They’re not aspirational goals,” Sabraw said.The identity of the children and parents as provided to the judge by the government under court order are currently shielded by law. The Legal Aid Society in New York said it is representing at least two of the separated children under five.One boy, from El Salvador, was due to be released to his mother, according to Beth Krause, the supervising attorney of Legal Aid’s Immigrant Youth Project.“I have no details about where, when, under what conditions,” she wrote in an email on Tuesday morning. The other boy, from Honduras, would remain with a foster family while the father remained in government custody, although it was not clear to her why.“I know very, very little about this case,” she said. “It’s all very frustrating.”The revelation comes on the same day that the Trump administration announced it would be implementing an ankle monitor system to track migrant families – a decision that was forced by Sabraw’s injunction and another federal court decision that came down on Monday.After Trump signed an executive order ending his administration’s family separation policy in June, agencies had planned to detain families and children together until the parents’ immigration proceedings were complete, a process that can take months. That proposal ran afoul of the decades-old Flores v Reno settlement, which stipulates that migrant children cannot be held in detention for more than 20 days.Reuters contributed to this story"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9213817cbf05472574de2bc2d128eb8239a7e7b2/0_161_4837_2903/master/4837.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=620ce415bc1d0b7d28d0331ce660db32","title":"germanys interior minister urged to resign","story":"Calls for Horst Seehofer to step down after suicide of deported Afghan manGermany’s interior minister has come under pressure to resign after one of 69 Afghans deported last week, as part of a tougher line on migration, was reported to have killed himself on his return home. The man was sent back as the minister, Horst Seehofer, fought a campaign within chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition to press for tighter restrictions on migrants. Seehofer’s “migration masterplan”, which he launched on Tuesday and which would toughen border and immigration controls, is at odds with the open-doors policy Merkel announced at the height of the 2015 refugee crisis. After Seehofer claimed credit for an increase in the pace of deportations of rejected asylum seekers, exulting that 69 Afghans had left on his 69th birthday, an interior ministry official on Wednesday announced the suicide of one of them. “We received confirmation from the Afghan authorities this morning that one of passengers on the repatriation flight was found dead in accommodation in Kabul,” the official told journalists.  “According to the Afghan authorities, it was a suicide,” the official added. There was no immediate comment from Seehofer, who has repeatedly clashed with Merkel and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners in his drive to raise his Christian Social Union’s party profile and head off a far-right challenge in a regional election. But Gyde Jensen, a lawmaker for the liberal Free Democrats and head of the parliamentary human rights committee, demanded Seehofer’s dismissal. “Anyone who celebrates 69 deportations for his 69th birthday is in the wrong job,” she said in a statement. “How many more derailments does the coalition need to dismiss the interior minister ... The limit has been reached.”Afghanistan said the 23-year-old failed asylum seeker had lived in Germany for eight years and was a minor when he came to the country. Some 17 years after the Taliban were ousted by a US-led campaign, following the September 11 attacks on the United States, security is fragile across much of Afghanistan and hundreds of civilians have been killed in attacks this year in the capital Kabul, as well as other cities. Last year, after a bombing in the Afghan capital of Kabul killed at least 90 people, Merkel said Germany would only deport criminals and people it considers a threat to Afghanistan.But Germany has recently abandoned those restrictions, based on a new assessment of the security situation in Afghanistan, the interior ministry said. Politicians from all parties, apart from Merkel’s and Seehofer’s conservative alliance and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), who Seehofer is trying to outflank in the Bavarian regional vote, called for his resignation. “His resignation is overdue. Hello coalition?!?” tweeted lawmaker Kevin Kuehnert, leader of the SPD’s youth wing.

We want to build a friendship with everybody. There is no alternative but Nato membership,” he said.He said countries, such as Bulgaria, managed to triple foreign direct investment after joining Nato, and he hoped it would deliver the same boost to his country.Russia, involved in a wider struggle for influence with the EU across the region, has already been accused of backing a failed coup in Montenegro in 2016.Russia said it would respond to the Greek expulsions by taking similar steps against Greek diplomats in Moscow.The expulsion of the diplomats, revealed in the Greek media on Wednesday but relayed by the Greek government to Russia on 6 July, follows evidence they were encouraging rallies to oppose the Macedonian name deal, including offering bribes to opponents of the deal.The historic naming deal, agreed on 17 June, will see the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia bow to Greek objections and change its name to Northern Macedonia. Greece had claimed the title Macedonia implied a territorial claim on the Greek province of the same name. The Greek newspaper Kathimerini named the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society, an organisation which promotes Russian ties to Christians in the Middle East, as being among the groups trying to fan Russian influence in Greece, including in the Greek Orthodox monastic community of Mount Athos.A representative of the society denied it was involved in any alleged attempts to bribe senior Greek Orthodox clergymen, the Russian state Interfax news agency reported.In 2008 Nato agreed to invite Macedonia to join the military alliance once its name dispute was settled, and Wednesday’s Nato summit meeting in Brussels will conclude with a formal invitation to join Nato.The name has been disputed between the two countries ever since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.The deal faces opposition in both Greece and in Macedonia, where a heated referendum is planned this autumn.The Macedonian opposition is trying to block the establishment of an electoral commission required to prepare for the referendum. It is also accusing leading politicians in the Macedonian government of treason for agreeing to the deal.Rejection of the deal inside Greece is, amongst others, coming from the seven MPs inside Independent Greeks (ANEL), the small rightwing nationalistic party in a governing coalition with the left wing Syriza, headed by Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras.The name issue has led to splits inside ANEL, and Russian media has been promoting the idea of a new populist party led by Dimitris Kammenos, dedicated to blocking the name change. Russia and Greece have until now maintained warm relations, with Athens one of the few countries that rejected a British request to expel diplomats in the wake of British claims of Russian involvement in the poisoning of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. But the Russian embassy in Athens has been previously accused of interfering in Greek politics following the leak of a tranche of emails in 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d7e14320379a65407ecd9dea5d577c3d1fee9ba/736_293_4652_2791/master/4652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4b93f3603f8ab9a5256ff7c16eee4e7","title":"irish senate approves ban on products from israeli settlements","story":"Despite anger from Israel, draft bill passes first round of voting in EU precedentIreland’s senate has voted in favour of a bill banning the importation of products from Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, paving the way for the country to become the first EU nation to enforce a boycott.The bill, which has faced angry Israeli opposition, prohibits “trade with and economic support for illegal settlements in territories deemed occupied under international law”.Having been approved in the upper house of the Irish parliament, the Seanad, the legislation will now need to get through more Seanad votes and then the lower house before becoming law.The peace process has been at death’s door since the former secretary of state John Kerry’s peace mission ended in failure in 2014. But the international community – apart from the US – is united in saying recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of\u0026nbspIsrael\u0026nbspis disastrous for any hopes of reviving meaningful talks. The status of Jerusalem is one of the pivotal issues that diplomats and peacemakers have said must be agreed between the two parties in negotiations.Palestinians will see Trump’s announcement as the end of their hopes and demands for East Jerusalem as a capital of a future independent state. While few want a return to violence, many will feel diplomatic efforts have got them no closer to a state of their own.\u0026nbspThe Israeli government will be thrilled. Ever since it captured (and later annexed) East Jerusalem in the 1967 six-day war, Israel has claimed the city as its “eternal and unided” capital, and has longed for international recognition. Some 200,000 Israelis living in illegal settlements will also celebrate.At Israel’s urging, a previously scheduled vote in January was delayed at the Irish government’s request. Israel’s foreign ministry, which is headed by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had summoned Ireland’s ambassador to Israel, Alison Kelly, at the time.Israel took control of the West Bank from Jordan in 1967, an area of land on which Palestinians hope to establish an independent state. Around 600,000 settlers live in occupied territory in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Golan Heights.Estimates put the value of settlement-made products to Ireland at between only €500,00 to €1m annually but proponents of the bill say it could chart a path for other EU states to follow.Netanyahu has denounced the bill, saying it “gives a tailwind to those who seek to boycott Israel and is utterly contrary to the principles of free trade and justice”. The bill does not ban all Israeli products. Frances Black, the independent senator who sponsored the bill, said in a statement before the vote that “trade in settlement goods sustains injustice”.“In the occupied territories, people are forcibly kicked out of their homes, fertile farming land is seized, and the fruit and vegetables produced are then sold on Irish shelves to pay for it all,” she said.“These settlements are war crimes, and it’s time for Ireland to show some leadership and refuse to support them.”The bill does not name Israel but instead refers to an “occupying power” and “illegal settler”.In 2015, the EU issued guidelines for the labelling of products from Israeli settlements, which it considers illegal and says are an obstacle to peace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c07c113570cc43cb51914349564d1580a94f199/0_137_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbcfb88c449a507d9e1e225d93db9a38","title":"somalia the rise of mogadishu artists music activists","story":"A new wave of artists, activists and entrepreneurs are trying to improve Somalia’s capital cityThe surprising sounds of a late evening in Mogadishu: surf on the beach, laughs of revellers, clinking of cups and glasses, oaths of harassed waiters and the soft melodies of the oud of Aweys Kabanle.Kabanle, a 45-year-old former dressmaker turned musician, is playing traditional Somali music at the luxury Mogadishu Beach View hotel at the city’s Lido to a smartly dressed audience in one of the world’s most dangerous cities.“This is Mogadishu. We laugh and sing. We play music. Music is for peace so we no longer live in fear,” Kabanle says, sipping a cappuccino.There are few cities with contrasts as stark as those of Mogadishu. Swollen by hundreds of thousands of people displaced by famine, drought and conflict in rural areas, its outlying districts resemble a vast refugee camp. Authorities are incompetent, corrupt or simply absent.It is seven years since the Islamic militants of al-Shabaab withdrew but many streets bear the scars of more than two decades of incessant warfare.Mogadishu’s inhabitants have long been known for their resilience, but a new wave of activists, entrepreneurs and artists are now trying to improve their city.Two years ago, Kabanle survived an al-Shabaab gun attack and suicide car bombing close to where he now performs every evening. The attack left at least 10 dead, including three of Aweys’s friends. The oud player was forced to jump over the wall of the hotel where he was playing to escape.“For several months following, there was no show,” he says. “People were unwilling to come back but I was committed to come here again. I started the first night by myself alone playing music and resumed hosting the show. Thanks be to God, people got confidence and now they are coming back for my show.”Despite the ongoing violence in the Somali capital, the economy is growing, hundreds of expatriates are returning from the west or African nations, scores of colleges are opening to cater for the young population and there is growing investment from the diaspora. Estate agents thrive: a two-storey house can cost nearly £100,000. Mogadishu has hosted a TEDx conference.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAhmed Hassan Sheikh decided to return to Mogadishu from Kenya a year and a half ago. He started his own arts company inside the fortified Mogadishu airport complex, where thousands of diplomats, United Nations staff and regional troops from the African Union stabilisation force are based.There is no shortage of demand for Sheikh’s paintings.“I do not need to fight with a gun. I have a powerful pen with which I draw my feelings. I believe through it I can bring change. I can make Mogadishu peaceful,” the 48-year-old artist says.His paintings call for young people to take up pens and books instead of arms, to warn against illegal migration and its devastating effects on Somali families.Other drawings recall life in old Mogadishu before the civil war, a time when the city was known as the most beautiful city in Africa. “When people see my artworks of former Mogadishu and how it used to be like, they appreciate how peaceful and prosperous Mogadishu was,” Ahmed says.Then there is Ubaxa Caasimadda (Flowers of the City), a group of students who, 18 months ago, set out to smarten scruffy city streets and mark roads to increase public safety. They started with the safest roads such as those near the presidential palace, because some had already received death threats from al-Shabaab.“When we started, we did not even know what will come out. It was just, go and do and then see. We knew the dangers we were facing but we took that risk,” says Amira Mahad Abdulle, a 24-year-old university student.Abdulle wears a burqa to conceal her identity and does not respond to phone calls from unknown people for her safety. “There are a lot of threats coming in but I try to stay safe. I do not fear. I want to serve Mogadishu,” she says.The group decided to act “because nobody else was willing to do it” and the government in Mogadishu is focused on fighting al-Shabaab. “We could not sit behind and wait for someone else to do this for the people of Mogadishu. We are the youth of this country and we decided to stand up for it,” Abdulle says.So far the group has painted dozens of zebra crossings and have planted flowers on pavements. “We are committed. We were born in Mogadishu and we want to help our city become developed, beautiful and safe like other cities in the world,” Isse Hassan Ibrahim, a 23-year-old typographic graduate, says.Though his best friend, a government employee, was assassinated by al-Shabaab last year, Ibrahim never stopped working as a volunteer in Mogadishu. “When my friend was killed, I got scared but I decided not to quit. I want to help my people and my capital city,” Ibrahim says. “We now have new youth groups joining us from other cities.”In the last 18 months, US and Somali forces have intensified the battle against al-Shabab, though without achieving decisive success. Last week US officials said a new airstrike killed 14 militants. Though the increased military activity has weakened the extremists, it also led to more civilian casualties.Kabanle believes his country will soon be at peace. “Somalia is no longer a war zone. It is a love zone,” he says, pointing to a group of young men and women sitting on the warm white sand of Mogadishu’s beach.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

We need fit-for-purpose, affordable accommodation,” she said.In a statement, Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O’Connor said the Government’s target was to provide 7,000 additional bed spaces by the end of next year and 21,000 by 2024.She said this would have long-term benefits in moderating rent levels.In the short term, Ms Mitchell O’Connor encouraged people to consider renting a spare room to a college student and availing of the rent-a-room scheme which allows iniduals earn up to €14,000 tax free.“This would not only provide an alternative source of accommodation for students, but is also a potential income for parents and others who may have a spare room available,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Almost 3,000 new student beds built in the past year, claims Government reportParliamentary party agrees to back incumbent in his bid to be re-elected PresidentBill to fix drafting errors in 2015 Act will also ban anonymous sperm, egg donationsState policy on protecting coastal communities at odds with reality, manager saysNotion of electricity barges in Irish Sea seen as \u0026lsquogob-smacking\u0026rsquo result of hard exit outcomeAccused pleads not guilty to intentionally or recklessly causing serious harm to the two womenForeman seeks explanation of charges and possible verdicts in relation to each manMinister rules out a return to old health board system in new reformsAmbulance crew \u0026lsquotold him to leave scene\u0026rsquo, Central Criminal Court trial in Cork hearsOireachtas education committee report says facilities can play key role in tackling obesityJustice Denis McDonald \u0026lsquoreally delighted\u0026rsquo the case has been resolvedPSNI confirms viable pipe bomb discovered at the peace line in restive BelfastFour died in \u0026lsquotragic accident\u0026rsquo not caused by driver, says defence lawyerPalestinian representatives and farmers applaud in visitor\u0026rsquos gallery as vote carriedThird member of family killed in motorcycle racing laid to rest in Ballymoney, Co Antrim\u0026lsquoYou\u0026rsquore a bit of a god, aren\u0026rsquot you?\u0026rsquo Prince Harry asks Galway hurler Joe Canning\u0026lsquoClosing Dunville Avenue a horror story\u0026rsquoJudge brands behaviour of son and daughter of dementia sufferer as \u0026lsquooutrageous\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561924.1531342230!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"connemara seafood plant says it has been squeezed out over fish quotas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrawns at the fish auction at Ros-a-Mhíl. Sale at Iasc Mara Teoranta has been described by Fianna Fáil Galway West TD Éamon Ó Cuív as a “major blow”. File photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyManagement of a Connemara seafood plant that has been forced to sell up said it had been squeezed out by a Government policy that was concentrating fish quotas in the hands of a few.Iasc Mara Teoranta in the State fishery harbour of Ros-a-Mhíl said it will have to find another buyer or close with the loss of 25 direct jobs, after more than 40 years in business.“This means that Connemara has lost its major fish processing plant, and places a question mark over the future of Ros-a-Mhíl as a fishery harbour,” Mr Ó Cuív said. He has called on the Government to convene a round-table discussion to examine the long-term implications.Iasc Mara Teo, which employed more than 200 people at its peak and had an annual turnover of between €5 and €6 million, depended on landings of mackerel and herring from Ros-a-Mhil boats.However, several of those vessels have been bought up or contracted to Killybegs-based companies in recent years, depriving Ros-a-Mhíl of their landings.Cathal Groonell, managing director of Iasc Mara, said the Government’s stated policy of ensuring an economic link between quota allocation and the nearest coastal communities was “not happening on the ground”. In a statement, the company said it was now uneconomic to continue, given the dramatic reduction in supplies.“The factory has modern processing, freezing and cold storage facilities and it is hoped to find a buyer that will continue to operate it as a fish processing facility,” the company said.If it is unable to attract a trade buyer, it will have to close with the loss of 25 job and with a wider impact on local businesses supplying , it said.The factory has 3.5 acres of land located to the Ros-a-Mhíl harbour and close to the Aran islands ferry terminal.Mr Groonell said a delegation from Ros-a-Mhíl had warned of the loss of supplies in an Oireachtas committee hearing, and had also met Minister for Marine Michael Creed at the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth conference in Galway two weeks ago.Asked to comment, a spokesman for Mr Creed said the State’s policy on management of fish quotas was on the department’s website, and “arrangements between licensed vessel owners and seafood processing firms in relation to the supply of fish . . . are private commercial matters between the parties concerned”.The Department of Agriculture, Marine and Food’s website states: “Any movement towards privatisation and concentration of rights into the hands of large companies would seriously risk fishing vessels losing an economic link with Ireland’s coastal communities and undermining the socio-economic importance of the fishing industry in the coastal communities dependant on fishing.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3559409.1531166658!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish breeder girls sent to australia during famine to be honoured","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from Skibbereen to Australia will be recalled in a bronze sculpture of 110 spoons by artist Toma McCullim. On leaving their famine-ravaged home town, each girl received two dresses, two petticoats, five pairs of stockings, two pairs of shoes, a bible, a bowl and a spoon.This summer, the poignant story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from the devastation of a starving Skibbereen to Australia – where they were referred to as “breeders” – will be recalled in a bronze sculpture and a large piece of Australian sandstone in the West Cork town.“This is a story of bravery, the bravery of women it is a story of heroines,” says Skibbereen-based artist Toma McCullim. The girls from the Skibbereen Union Workhouse were despatched to Australia to provide labour, marry, have children and help colonise the sprawling continent.It’s uncertain how much choice, if any, they had in their departure, the artist says. At the time, 60 people a day were dying in the Skibbereen workhouse, which was rife with disease and hunger.The 110 were essentially “farmed”, says the artist with Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre, who has been the driving force behind the year-long 110 Skibbereen Girls public art project.In documentation she studied as part of her research through residencies at Uillinn, West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen and at the site of Skibbereen Workhouse, now Skibbereen Community Hospital Campus, the girls were referred to as “breeders”.The residencies allowed McCullim to carry out research and support a variety of tours, talks, film screenings and participatory workshops on the theme of the 110 girls and their journey to Australia.The 110 girls departed for Australia under the Earl Grey Famine Orphan Scheme, named after the colonial secretary who enacted it.This scheme had two aims: to reduce overcrowding in Irish workhouses through an assisted emigration scheme and to send female immigrants to settle in Australia where at the time there were nine men for every woman.The board of s in every union in Ireland put forward the names of suitable girls aged 14-18. An estimated 4,000 girls left the country under the scheme. Skibbereen Workhouse offered the most girls outside Dublin. There are believed to be in the region of 10,000 descendants of the young Skibbereen emigrants.Although the girls did not have to be orphans to be eligible for the scheme, it was stipulated that they were not to be living with their families, be of good character, unmarried and without children so that there would be no impediment to marrying Australian settlers.“Many of them did better in Australia than they could have done in the prevailing conditions in Ireland at the time,” says McCullim.At least two descendants are expected to make the journey to Skibbereen next month for a special ceremony honouring their ancestors’ story.One hundred and 10 bronze spoons have been cast by McCullim from beeswax moulds created by staff and residents at the Skibbereen Community Hospital complex, formerly the workhouse.Throughout this month, the spoons will be embedded in the archway above what used to be the workhouse’s Women’s Entrance, near the site’s famine burial ground.This piece of public art, which will be unveiled by the Australian ambassador on July 20th, will also include an installation of a piece of Australian sandstone, donated by the Australian embassy, which is expected to be placed in front of the archway.The ceremony will take place the day after the prestigious Coming Home: Art and the Great Hunger exhibition of historical and contemporary artwork from Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum, Quinnipiac University in the US state of Connecticut, opens in Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen.The exhibition is on display in Dublin Castle"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561957.1531350564!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord duke and duchess dazzle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prince Harry and  Meghan Markle with  President Michael Higgins  and his wife, Sabina, with  Bród and Siodá, Michael D’s Bernese Mountain dogs. Photograph: Getty ImagesWhat about this handsome couple, with their good hair, smiling eyes and lovely manners?Gorgeous and utterly charming, a winning combination of impeccable breeding and lustrous celebrity. They won, and they melted, many hearts. They have to dazzle, because it is part of the terms and conditions for working royals on walkabout duty. The royal rambles were in Trinity College and at the CHQ venue in Dublin’s Docklands, where the celebrity drawing power of the newly wed Prince and American actress unleashed waves of unbridled enthusiasm and exaltation among the crowds who came along to have a good look at them. Their day began in Áras an Uachtaráin, a short distance from Farmleigh House where they lodged the night before. President Higgins and his wife, Sabina, bustled into the State reception room to greet them, a spray of pink-tinged white roses on the mantelpiece behind them and the visitors’ book open on a small table commissioned for the visit of Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, in 2011. Outside, staff raked and reraked the gravel paths, and Bród and Siodá, Michael D’s Bernese Mountain dogs, lumbered lazily around the geraniums and fountains.“You’re most welcome,” smiled the President, greeting his guests. Meghan was toting a very large black handbag which cost thousands of pounds. Everyone reckoned she didn’t have anything in it, apart from a bit of lipstick and an emergency sliver of lettuce. According to Harper’s Bazaar, it was a Fendi bag, but that doesn’t really matter because apparently whenever she carries a new bag and the photographs appear, they sell out in a matter of hours. We’ll all just have to wait for the new order to come in. The two couples made polite conversation for the cameras and nobody in the heaving media contingent uttered a word because of protocol until Newstalk’s Henry McKean roared a question to the immeasurable relief of everyone else. There was only one question on Wednesday. “Is football coming home?” Michael D smiled and remained silent but, with England’s World Cup semi-final just hours away, the Duke couldn’t resist replying. “Most definitely!” he declared, and everyone in the room laughed uproariously and went weak at the knees.The group enjoyed a potter around the gardens and the royals rang the Peace Bell. Then came the news that everyone wanted to hear. “They met the dogs.” Or the “first dogs”.Staff from the Áras came out to witness the departure. When the presidential couple and the royal couple tried to gracefully exit the main doors, the two dogs barged their way past with not a care for status or office. Then Harry and Meghan had a final few words with their hosts – “Absolutely lovely” said Sabina – before waving farewell to Bród and Siodhá.Did the President, who announced on Tuesday he will be seeking a second term, say “this is not goodbye, but merely au revoir?” On the way to Trinity College, hugely important questions had to be teased out. What colour was the dress? Mushroom, stone, taupe? But there was clearly just a single ruffle and it was definitely cocktail length. Another fact had to be nailed down by the royal reporters. “Did she actually wave to the dog? Did she?” She did. “And the dog waved back,” snapped an RTÉ cameraman, rolling his eyes.People were anxious about the visit to Trinity. The Duchess was wearing very high heels. Could she cope on the cobbles? She nearly tripped on a very low step leaving the Áras and Michael D had to reach out a steadying hand. “She will be walking from The Long Hall,” declared an American journalist. We didn’t tell him this was the name of a nearby public house because people were worried enough. Finally, after viewing the ancient manuscript in Trinity’s Long Room, the couple emerged to delighted screams of welcome and a forest of upheld phones. Megan gingerly picked her way across the cobblestones. The international TV journalists got to work as the walkabout unfolded behind them. Ireland’s “long and troubled past” got a big airing but the royal visit was a “positive sign of improved relations between the two countries”. Strangers could be forgiven for thinking we were at war with some of the things being said. “Harreee! Harreee!” came the cries. “Meghan! Meghan! Over here!” The couple got stuck in, covering more space than Dulux, shaking hands, chatting, looking very interested, asking friendly questions, saying nice things. When the couple left, tourists and locals alike were buzzing with excitement. “There’s hardly a pick on Meghan but she’s perfectly proportioned,” said one woman. “Harry’s photographs don’t do him justice at all. He’s very handsome,” remarked Una O’Neill, a retired teacher from Templeogue. Beside her, student and top basketball player Chloe Mullins (19) held a framed black and white drawing she did of the couple’s engagement photograph. Harry stopped immediately when he saw it. “Is that for me? Wow!” He showed Meghan the picture, then said to Chloe: “You’ve given me more hair than I have.” He kept the gift, although Kensington Palace officials had gone around the crowd earlier saying they would not be accepting gifts.Then the visitors and their entourage broke for lunch at Delahunt restaurant on Camden Street to fortify themselves for the next leg – a trip to see the famine memorial on the Liffey quayside. Then they were introduced to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe who said “thank you very much” to the royals for gracing his Dublin Central Constituency, along with the Epic emigration museum in the CHQ. Yet again, the crowd was thrilled to see them in the flesh. “Today is all about Harry – Windsor, Maguire, Kane” read a poster held high by London-born Melissa Moloney. Maguire and Kane would be playing later for England. Eight-year-old Ayana O’Callaghan from Clontarf in Dublin gave her opinion on Meghan. “I think she’s pretty but she shouldn’t have to wear tights because her skin is really nice.” But it wasn’t all fun and happiness among the selfie-sticks, delirious tourists and screaming girls. “Daddy, I touched both of them,” said a breathless Twinkle Polgolla (12) from Park West to her dad. “I felt special.” Her sisters Nikishi and Tharu were equally excited because they too shook a royal hand. But their sister June (14) was inconsolable, tears falling down her face. “She didn’t make it. They moved on,” explained her mum.

Leigh Day said the claims lodged so far are only the first 1,000 of many, and said it expects the number of claims, which concern the disparity in pay between store staff and those in the predominantly male dominated distribution centres, will continue to rise. The firm announced in February that it would take legal action against Tesco, and since then has spoken to thousands of staff members who work in the supermarket’s stores and are paid “considerably less than their colleagues in the distribution centres”. According to Leigh Day, people working in the distribution centres may earn in excess of £11.00 an hour whilst the most common grade for store staff sees them receive around £8.00 per hour.This “underpayment” could apply to more than 250,000 Tesco employees, the law firm said, meaning estimated pay shortfalls could reach £20,000 and the final bill for Tesco could be as high as £4bn.Paula Lee, one of the lawyers handling the Tesco claims at Leigh Day, said: “We’ve had an incredible response to the announcement of this legal action. Many proud members of staff have realised that this claim is not anti-Tesco, but it is to ensure that the work done in stores and distribution centres is recognised as being of equal value not the same work, but work of equal value and that they should be paid the same as their colleagues in distribution.Tesco says tie-up with France’s Carrefour will lead to lower pricesAldi, Asda, Tesco and Waitrose recall soy sauce over safety risk“Both store staff and distribution staff play an essential role in making billions of pounds for Tesco executives and shareholders, they should both be paid equally for what they contribute to the business.“The concept of ‘women’s work’ is an outdated approach to employment from the middle of the last century which needs to be corrected.”A Tesco spokesperson said: “We cannot comment on an ongoing legal matter, but we will be defending this claim about equal pay. Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do.”Leigh Day said it is also representing more than 20,000 shop-floor workers in equal pay claims against Sainsbury’s and Asda.

Once again, the scientists found evidence of huge ersity in our deep past, evidence of which can still be found in modern Africans.The evolution of human populations in Africa was multi-regional. Our ancestry was multi-ethnic. And the evolution of our material culture was, well, multi-cultural, said Dr Scerri.More than anything, she added, this new understanding of our own story reminds us that although we may feel special, modern humans are not an “end point”.“In reality the situation is we are an evolving lineage, we are not an end product. What we look like now is just a point in a process – a snapshot if you like,” she said.\u0026nbsp“People looked different 300,000 years ago, or even 10,000 years ago.”In relatively modern times, humanity has rapidly evolved to adapt to the development of agriculture, and according to Dr Scerri this state of constant flux will continue into the future as well.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A new study suggests not only that the public in the UK and America does have a strong sense of trust in scientific experts, but also that people trust experts more than politicians, even when the experts themselves are espousing “silly ideas”.The large-scale study, conducted by academics at Queen Mary University in London, examined the responses of groups of people to “behavioural nudges”, suggested either by scientists, or by “a government working group consisting of special interest groups and policy makers”.Gove ‘physically ripped up’ official report on customs optionsMichael Gove tells water firms they are getting it \u0027wrong\u0027Ecologically disastrous palm oil \u0027better than alternatives\u0027These nudges were behavioural interventions designed to improve day-to-day decision-making. Some were real and had been implemented, such as using catchy pictures in stairwells to encourage people to take the stairs instead of the lift, while others were fictitious and implausible like the suggestion stirring coffee anti-clockwise for two minutes could help avoid cancerous effects.The study, published in the journal Basic and Applied Social Psychology, found trust was higher for scientists than the government working group, even when the scientists were proposing fictitious nudges.But the work also revealed there is a slight tendency for the US sample to find the nudges more plausible and more ethical overall compared to the UK sample.Lead author Dr Magda Osman, from Queen Mary’s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: “In the context of debates regarding the loss of trust in experts, what we show is that in actual fact, when compared to a government working group, the public in the US and UK judge scientists very favourably, so much so that they show greater levels of trust even when the interventions that are being proposed are implausible and most likely ineffective. “This means that the public still have a high degree of trust in experts, in particular, in this case, social scientists.”She added: “The evidence suggests that trust in scientists is high, but that the public are sceptical about nudges in which they might be manipulated without them knowing. They consider these as less ethical and trust the experts proposing them less with nudges in which they do have an idea of what is going on.”Nudges are an increasingly popular means of influencing decision making, and are used by governments across a wide range of areas including health, personal finance, and general wellbeing.UK news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May stand together as they gather for a family picture during a Nato summit in Brussels.Serena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

In other words, ask the questions in the right way, and people will show a level of scrutiny that is often not attributed to them. “So, before there are strong claims made about public opinion about experts, and knee-jerk policy responses to this, it might be worth being a bit more careful about how the public are surveyed in the first place.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Leigh Day said the claims lodged so far are only the first 1,000 of many, and said it expects the number of claims, which concern the disparity in pay between store staff and those in the predominantly male dominated distribution centres, will continue to rise. The firm announced in February that it would take legal action against Tesco, and since then has spoken to thousands of staff members who work in the supermarket’s stores and are paid “considerably less than their colleagues in the distribution centres”. According to Leigh Day, people working in the distribution centres may earn in excess of £11.00 an hour whilst the most common grade for store staff sees them receive around £8.00 per hour.This “underpayment” could apply to more than 250,000 Tesco employees, the law firm said, meaning estimated pay shortfalls could reach £20,000 and the final bill for Tesco could be as high as £4bn.Paula Lee, one of the lawyers handling the Tesco claims at Leigh Day, said: “We’ve had an incredible response to the announcement of this legal action. Many proud members of staff have realised that this claim is not anti-Tesco, but it is to ensure that the work done in stores and distribution centres is recognised as being of equal value not the same work, but work of equal value and that they should be paid the same as their colleagues in distribution.Tesco says tie-up with France’s Carrefour will lead to lower pricesAldi, Asda, Tesco and Waitrose recall soy sauce over safety risk“Both store staff and distribution staff play an essential role in making billions of pounds for Tesco executives and shareholders, they should both be paid equally for what they contribute to the business.“The concept of ‘women’s work’ is an outdated approach to employment from the middle of the last century which needs to be corrected.”A Tesco spokesperson said: “We cannot comment on an ongoing legal matter, but we will be defending this claim about equal pay. Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do.”Leigh Day said it is also representing more than 20,000 shop-floor workers in equal pay claims against Sainsbury’s and Asda.

just one of scores of historical sites whose outlines are emerging in the heatwaveThe current heatwave is providing a near-unprecedented bonanza for archaeologists,\u0026nbspas scorched conditions all over Britain expose the previously undiscovered or long-hidden outlines of everything from ancient fortifications to remnants of the\u0026nbspSecond World War.\u0026nbspIn what was described as “a

fort in Talybont, Wales With Britain having experienced its longest heatwave since 1976 and the hottest June on record, a remarkable number of crop marks have appeared, sometimes showing the presence of buried remains that have lain unnoticed for decades or, in the case of the new discoveries, for centuries.Langstone, Newport, south Wales (RCAHMWSWNS)In hot weather, crop marks expose the presence of things like historic buildings or burial mounds\u0026nbspbecause the grass or crops above them grow differently compared to plants in the surrounding soil.A buried ditch that once ringed a\u0026nbsphill fort\u0026nbspwill collect more underground water and nutrients, so the plants above it will grow taller and greener while the hot weather parches all the neighbouring vegetation.\u0026nbspThe underground remains of a wall, meanwhile, will have drier and poorer soil above it, producing shorter and browner plants.Ms Barker explained that the differences are more noticeable in the kind of prolonged hot weather that can affect even normally hardy greenery like grass.\u0026nbspWhich means that when the rain comes, the crop marks vanish again. \u0026nbsp“It’s a frantic race against time and the weather,” said Ms Barker.\u0026nbsp“There is just this window of opportunity, and then, according to the forecast, in the next couple of days the rain will come and it will all be lost again – the outlines will start disappearing before your eyes.”But even though the rain is coming, Ms Barker said the discoveries already made would produce great advances in archaeological knowledge, once the aerial images had been examined and the newly discovered features had been investigated at ground level.fortlet whose remains have lain hidden beneath a field near Magor, south Wales, for centuries (RCAHMWSWNS)She said: “We have found a Roman fortlet which will allow us to learn more about where the garrisons were and how the Roman conquest progressed.\u0026nbspWe have found an early medieval cemetery from maybe the eighth or ninth century, with the potential to tell us more about the period that used to be called the Dark Ages. \u0026nbsp“At the known sites, we have seen more and more things come out as it has got drier and drier.”Elsewhere in the UK, emerging crop marks have given archaeologists another look at the outlines of Venta Icenorum, the Romano-British predecessor of Norwich, which was first discovered when the RAF aeroplanes flew over it in the summer of 1928.SWNS)The heat has also allowed the outlines of a “ghost garden” to emerge at Gawthorpe Hall near Burnley, Lancashire. \u0026nbspDesigned by Sir Charles Barry in the 1850s, the garden was covered up after the Second World War.\u0026nbspNow the exceptionally hot weather has allowed National Trust staff to see previously unnoticed features that may actually be from gardens that predated the work of Sir Charles, at a site which has been built on since the 14th century.Long-lost North American Viking settlement was in CanadaBin lorry melts into road as hottest day of year forecast for UKMs Barker said: “The heat has allowed us to do things over a huge area and in a time frame that no amount of digging or ground radar surveys could have achieved, unless you had an unlimited budget and were willing to go slightly mad prospecting in hundreds of farmers’ fields on a hunch or nothing.“I think it will add a huge amount to our knowledge.”The heatwave has also allowed the public to discover their own crop marks revealing everything from wartime Anderson shelters to Bronze Age cremation sites.The result has been a widespread sharing of discoveries on social media.So far, however, some accounts of what has supposedly been discovered appear more optimistic than accurate.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is the extent to which our lives are inter-meshed with the lives of our European partners and that is what will happen if there is no deal on anything.”Mr Grieve said hardline anti-Brexit MPs had “abdicated” their responsibilities to the public, by boasting that they will do “absolutely nothing while we skated off the edge of the cliff into this major national crisis”.“That is the madness that has crept into some of the discourse in parliament,” he added.Meanwhile, Ms Leadsom refused to be drawn on whether she had contemplating resigning over the Chequers plan – as Boris Johnson and David Davis later did.“I won’t comment on what happened at Chequers – that was a cabinet meeting,” the Commons leader said.But, hinting any further concessions would be unacceptable, she said: “I will be looking at whether our red lines have been breached.”Insisting what was important was that the EU knew the no-deal threat was real, Ms Leadsom said: “We will be prepared to consider leaving without a deal.”Meanwhile, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked vested interests that were colouring the views of big businesses, which wanted to protect themselves from tariffs on their goods.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

It\u0027s less a question of whether I fancy a crack at it – I\u0027m not sure the Labour Party would have me, to be quite frank.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered.

Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attend a bilateral breakfast ahead of the NATO Summit in BrusselsThe last four Thai Navy SEALs come out safely after completing the rescue mission inside a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France.

Here are the candidates most likely to take over, with odds from Ladbrokes.The Home Secretary is currently the favourite to replace Mrs May if her leadership crumbles.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known eurosceptic, Mr Javid ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular amongst the Tory parliamentary party.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has also has garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.Jeremy Corbyn has emerged as the favourite among most bookies as the nations likely next PM.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected 2017 general election when Labour picked up 30 seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Despite a study showed the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, he is enjoying strong support in opinion polls.He will be hoping Tory infighting over Europe leads to another election, which he has boasted he would win.Environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since knifing Boris Johnson.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone forever.But Mr Gove, who played a key role in the 2016 EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior and green campaigner as Environment Secretary.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.But his support among fellow MPs seems to have evaporated in the EU referendum fallout.Mr Johnson infuriated David Cameron by using his huge public profile to campaign for Leave.His own leadership bid in 2016 was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.BoJo has repeatedly pledged his support to Mrs May but has also angered Cabinet colleagues by trying to hijack Brexit talks and demanding extra cash for the NHS.His ambitions for the top job are well known and he is a proven winner, having been elected twice as Mayor of London in a city that heavily favours Labour.Now Foreign Secretary, Mr Hunt is the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history.He left the Department of Health after securing a £20bn funding increase for the NHS.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and although he campaigned for Remain during the referendum he has since changed his mind and said he would now vote to Leave because of the arrogance of the EU.Thought an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the 2016 leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa Mays childlessness.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The new Brexit secretary is now in the running after taking Davis vacant spot.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign and previously served as a Justice minister too.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment has been welcomed by other Leave-backing MPs.But Labour MPs have been circulating a blog-post he wrote back in 2011 where he called for an end to feminist bigotry and said that men were getting a raw deal after new equality legislation.At one time, Ms Rudd was a leading contender to replace the PM but her odds have lengthened significantly following the Windrush scandal and her resignation after misleading Parliament over immigration targets.She has returned to the backbenches after being forced to resign as Home Secretary and is likely to push for a softer Brexit along with other former Cabinet members like Nicky Morgan and Justine Greening.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could make a bid for Number 10 after keeping a low profile during the general election.Mr Hammond is seen by supporters as a steady hand, but critics accuse him of trying to kibosh a clean-break Brexit by steering the PM towards keeping close ties.He is seen as one of the leading campaigners for a soft Brexit which often puts him at odds with Brexiteers like Liam Fox and David Davis.Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired last June, costing the party its Commons majority.She also endured a series of mishaps during Octobers Tory Party conference and the fallout of the Pestminster scandal.A survey of Tory members in July showed more than 70 per cent want the PM to remain in post, but that fell to just 26 per cent in February 2018.If Mrs May was to resign there would be likely be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence, leading to the government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.In this scenario, there could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done. But our ambitious, effective proposal for a smooth customs arrangement and continued security co-operation is a huge step forward.It’s a good deal for Europe, and a good deal for Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

The shore is lined with hostile Remainers. As for the voters — the 17.4million “thick and ignorant racists” who backed Brexit in 2016 — who cares about them?Britain is now offering a peace deal to Brussels which, however we gloss it over, stinks of surrender.To quote Boris Johnson, who backed it: “You can’t polish a turd.”This is not a White Paper. It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget. If only a small percentage sit out the next Election, Jezza will be our first Marxist PM.Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid tried to put a shine on a deal they claim is the “best available”.And they didn’t even have the decency to hold their noses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This fudge is the result of the PM’s dithering and failure to plan for “no deal” — that essential weapon of any negotiator’s armoury.Had she won the 100-plus majority predicted before last year’s election things would be different.

We are highly doubtful but we hope he’s right.To us, a proper Brexit, which would have made us a freer, richer country and was backed by a 17.4 million majority, has been given up without a fight.Remainer Tories MUST study the polls showing their party could now face an election wipeout as their core voters desert them. Their sliding ratings will go into freefall if they vote alongside Labour this month to keep us in an EU customs union ­— a total negation of Brexit.If Brexit is further watered down to meaninglessness, the Tories are finished.MICHAEL Fallon is right to try to stop ­taxpayers’ cash being used to reopen cases from the Troubles.Our ageing veterans live in fear of arrest for difficult decisions taken decades ago in a war zone.This witch-hunt MUST end.OUR boys’ World Cup success is set to cause a baby boom as randy fans celebrate by romping.If the Three Lions deliver us the World Cup there will be a BOOM in certain names, too.Expect some Harrys and Gareths.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We used it as a second home but decided to make it our main home when we retired and thought we would modernise and extend it.We had worked with an architect called Stan Bolt on a house we had in Salcombe and that was a very good experience so we went to him again.But hes a modern architect and this was a cottage. We wanted to keep the cottage as it has a lot of local history and its emotionally important to us.It would have been much easier to knock it down and build something new, but we didnt want to do that and Stan didnt either.It gave us more space for the kids and grandchildren to stay and it works well as a home, the old flows very well into the new.The area has a great atmosphere, its a lovely place to live. There are no near neighbours but its only a ten minute walk into Great Bedwyn and you can get from there to Paddington station in 71 minutes.Well be sad to see it go but life moves on.Mirldown House now has 2,908 sq ft of accommodation with an entrance hall, kitchen/breakfast room, sitting room, drawing room, dining room, study, five bedrooms and three bathrooms.There is also a garage with a workshop and store room and the gardens extend to 2.68 acres with lawns, mature trees and hedging.It has a tennis court tucked away at the side and a Grade II listed kiln in the grounds.The house is on the edge of the popular village of Great Bedwyn, which has a thriving local community and is easily commutable to London.The village is surrounded on all sides by beautiful rolling countryside and lies on the edge of Savernake Forest. The Kennet \u0026amp Avon Canal runs through the middle and the area is very popular for walking and riding."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0003560299321.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"559\" width=\"960","title":"ministers plan to float thousands of generators in the irish sea in case of no deal brexit to make sure northern ireland doesnt lose power","story":"Thousands of electricity generators could have to be dragged back from places as far away as Afghanistan if talks break down, because of an old agreement with the Republic of Ireland.Private Government documents revealed that leaving the EU with no deal would put into doubt energy on the island of Ireland, the Financial Times revealed.At the moment, the North shares an energy market with the Republic, thanks to the Good Friday Agreement signed in 1998.And ministers hope that can continue after we leave.But if there were no deal, the Republic could cut off power to the north because it would not be part of the European market.In that case, Britain would have to scramble together thousands of generators to prevent blackouts - many of which are being used around the world.A Government spokesperson confirmed the reports, and told the paper: We are working hard on a solution.As a responsible government, we will continue to prepare for all scenarios, including the highly unlikely outcome that we leave the EU without any deal next March, the spokesman added.Ministers have said Britain must step up its preparations for no-deal Brexit as negotiations with the EU continue to run into roadblocks.The Sun revealed today that secret plans have been drawn up to stockpile foods in the event of EU divorce talks collapsing - to show Brussels that no deal is not a bluff.That includes emergency measures to keep Britain’s massive food and drinks industry afloat - including stockpiling ahead of exit day on 29 March next year.More than £22 billion worth of processed food and drinks are imported in to the UK - 97 per cent from the EU - in an industry that keeps 400,000 workers employed in the UK.Similar stockpiles are also being prepared for medical supplies amid fears of chaos at British ports next year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will we be able to sign our own trade deals? And will the UK be outside the jurisdiction of the European Court?I’m very pleased to say the answers are very simple: yes, yes and yes.First, it will mean a genuine end to freedom of movement.No longer will people be allowed to arrive here from across Europe on the off-chance that they might find a job.We will always welcome the skilled professionals who help our country thrive, from doctors and nurses to engineers and entrepreneurs but for the first time in decades, we will have full control of our borders.And it will be the UK, not Brussels, that decides who should be allowed to live and work here.Second, we will have our own completely independent trade policy, our own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs and strike trade deals with whoever we please.British goods and services are in huge demand internationally, so it’s no surprise that countries are queuing up to make trade deals with us after we leave the EU.We are having good discussions with countries we would aim to sign trade deals with, including the US, as I will discuss with President Trump when he arrives in the UK on Thursday.Third, our plan will take back control of our laws.We will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, instead, British judges in British courts will rule on our laws.And while we will commit to have common rules with the EU on things like exhaust emissions and food safety, Parliament will have to agree these rules.Put simply, such EU rules will no longer automatically and directly apply in the UK — Parliament will have a say.It’s clear to me that this is the right Brexit deal for Britain, although there are, of course, some alternatives.The EU’s preferred option — a standard, off-the-shelf trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market — would break up our country.The other option the EU suggests, a combination of EEA membership with continued membership of the customs union, would not be Brexit at all.We would have no control over immigration, no ability to strike our own trade deals, and would still be liable for vast annual payments to Brussels.And while we must prepare for the possibility of leaving without a deal, I’m clear that the best outcome — for both the UK and the EU — is a deal based on the ideas we are setting out on Thursday.As for Labour, they are opening the door to a second referendum — ignoring the decision taken by the country and making it harder to get a good deal.Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.And, as Prime Minister, it is the Brexit I am determined to deliver.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

She only has two weeks \u0027til recess. It\u0027s the worst time to resign. If she can keep her head down \u0027til then, she\u0027s safe til October.\"Her survival and unexpectedly plucky performance in the House has even led to some excited bien-pensant chatter that the resignations have left her stronger than before.The argument goes that Mr Johnson and Mr Davis were destined to resign, that their departure from the cabinet means she is now surrounded by allies, not enemies. She is liberated.She may feel relief at not having to duck and weave to please the mansplaining Mr Davis and Mr Johnson every other Thursday from now on.But medium term, it seems to me undeniable that the resignations of Mr Johnson and Mr Davis have weakened Mrs May for one very important reason. Their resignations have legitimised betrayal - both within the parliamentary Conservative Party and out.As one despondent Leaver MP said to me: \"I could have sold Chequers to my constituents. Now I can\u0027t. All they\u0027ll think now, whatever we put forward, is that it\u0027s a sellout.\"His despair is well founded: Mr Johnson in particular, one of the only political figures the public recognise, with his warnings of \"semi-Brexit\" and colonial status, seems to have gone out of his way to stoke the furnaces of Brexit apostasy.Those furnaces now burn brightly within the Conservative Party too.As Jacob Rees-Mogg told me shortly after Mr Davis resigned: \"It raises the most serious questions about the prime minister\u0027s ideas. If the Brexit secretary cannot support them, then they cannot be very good proposals.\"Fellow Brexiteer Philip Davies told the PM that her scheme represented \"a Remainer coup\".Mr Johnson and Mr Davis were appointed to their jobs because they gave Theresa May - the Remainer prime minister - Brexiteer credentials. Now they\u0027ve taken those spurs away, in spectacular fashion. It was just about conceivable that had Mrs May been able to keep Mr Johnson and certainly Mr Davis in her cabinet, she might have attracted the lion\u0027s share of Brexiteer support for her proposals if and when they come to the House of Commons in the form of a deal.But now, with her ideas damned as heresy, if the Chequers ideas aren\u0027t substantially altered (and it seems from the PM\u0027s statement in the House that they won\u0027t be) it is hard to see how or why the hardline Brexiteers can or will vote for them - and Mr Davis and Mr Johnson will lead the charge in opposition.Brexit nirvana, they will say, can be achieved if we vote them down - and thereby secure the hard Brexit we crave.If the PM had succeeded last June in winning a decent majority, this would be less of a problem.That - despite her protestations to the contrary - was the election\u0027s aim, to give her the space she needed to make the compromises she knew would necessary.These internal party contortions inexorably flow from her failure to secure it. With no majority at all every Brexiteer vote, even the votes of the three ministers who resigned, will be pivotal.It is not obvious, without her Brexiteer MPs supporting Chequers, how she can guide a deal through parliament.And if she can\u0027t, what exactly is the point of Mrs May? It is why she tried so hard to keep them on side. Without them there is only one option left for the prime minister, one remaining route through.When the final vote comes, she must attract Labour votes.If negotiations drag on to the last possible weeks, perhaps even into 2019, the PM could make a credible pitch to pro-Remain Labour MPs: vote for this, or we crash out with no deal at all. There is no time for an election. It\u0027s this, or bust. Country before party.She will therefore, in effect, be asking Labour to solve the Brexit riddle on her behalf.A tacit acceptance that the Conservative Party, with its deep, gorge-like fissures, cannot resolve the issue.That will put Remainer Labour MPs in an invidious position. The tantalising chance to defeat the government, to remove a sitting prime minister, will be theirs for the taking - but at the cost of plunging the country into profound crisis. In those circumstances, even if Jeremy Corbyn tried to whip his MPs to vote against the deal, he might find it difficult to stop some of his most pro-European colleagues traipsing into the government lobby - especially if, the cost of their votes is a continued softening of Brexit.Some of them, after all, represent some of the most Remain constituencies in the country - how will they explain to their constituents that they enabled the hardest Brexit possible?Mr Corbyn might even get in on the act, seizing the opportunity to in effect control the Brexit process and sell himself to the country as a statesman.And putting country before party might not be an entirely magnanimous act for Labour.Getting the softest of Brexits through on Labour votes would be a devastating blow for Mrs May and the Tory Party more generally. She would become the Ramsay MacDonald of the Conservative Party.The Brexiteers would probably split and form a separate grouping in parliament.The Tory Party - which has throughout its history been better at absorbing splinter groups than making them - would be more fractured and divided than at any time since the Corn Laws. This is a danger to which Brexiteers are alive. They are alarmed at reports that the government has been briefing Labour MPs about their Brexit proposals.Mr Rees-Mogg warned the PM of the dangers of that strategy: \"It is a matter of grave concern. It would prompt a split, but a split from the top.\"In this scenario Mrs May would probably be finished as PM.But I wonder if she has concluded, that her premiership, once Brexit is complete, is over anyway.I am struck by the language she used yesterday at the 1922 Committee, talking of doing \"the right thing for the country\".She may be preparing, psychologically and politically, for the ultimate compromise ahead. She might have concluded that in the end, the plaudits she is seeking are not from her party, but from history."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/02/2048x1152/skynews-twitter-social-media_4225798.jpg?20180208133717 ","title":"football isnt coming home but england fans are proud of gareth southgates team","story":"England fans hadn\u0027t really travelled in huge numbers for the previous games, but they were here in force this time.The famous Three Lions song blasted out around the stadium.England fans on the way out after the 2-1 extra-time defeat told me they were proud of this young squad.Others said they had \"thrown it away\", just like the lyric from that song.England lasted longer here than Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Spain and Portugal."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-lewis-pugh-ocean-rescue_4359141.jpg?20180711140147 ","title":"is lewis pugh physically ready to take on the long swim","story":"Lewis has done months of preparation in the sea off Cape Town, where he lives.But this was the first time that he has trained while scientists monitored his heart with ECGs and his core body temperature with a rectal thermometer.They first tested his response to cold water, plunging him into a pool set at 18C, the same temperature as the Channel.Cold water shock can cause a cardiac arrest.

The US President has been ripping up the diplomatic rulebook across the globe as he pulls America out of the rules-based international order. But there have been lighter moments in Brussels too. Here are the five biggest things we\u0027ve learned from the NATO summit so far: 1. Donald Trump carries out campaign pledges  Arriving in Brussels, the President held talks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the US Ambassador\u0027s residence.  TV cameras and a handful of journalists are routinely invited into these meetings to record “the top” - the opening remarks. Usually these are polite – boring - pleasantries as protagonists explain how pleased they are to see each other and how they are going to have a good, constructive conversation. Not Trump. Tossing convention aside, he tore into NATO, and Germany in particular, over defence spending. During his election campaign he frequently moaned about the fact the US pumps so much more into defence than its allies, and pledged to tackle NATO counterparts about the “unfairness”. As soon as he got to the Belgian capital, he did just that.  2. Angela Merkel is the Queen of the cold, hard slap down The German Chancellor, who unlike Donald Trump is not on Twitter, had three hours to think about her comeback to the President\u0027s rant about her country\u0027s defence spending. She would have been especially shocked at his claim that her country is a Russian “captive” because of its reliance on Russian gas.  Often mocked for being too serious, Frau Merkel delivered the perfect response. Recalling her childhood in East Germany, she said: I have experienced myself how a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union. I am very happy that today we are united in freedom, the Federal Republic of Germany.  “Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions. “That is very good, especially for people in eastern Germany. \u0027Nuff said. 3. Theresa May can throw shade Whether she meant it or not – and let\u0027s face it, she probably didn\u0027t – the clip of her apparently inviting then snubbing a Donald Trump handshake is gold. Seemingly offering her hand to the President, as soon as he extended his she moved her arm away and guided Mr Trump towards Jeremy Hunt, the new Foreign Secretary. At a time when the President is losing friends fast around the world, the Prime Minister – possibly inspired by French leader Emmanuel Macron performing the same trick last year - did her global street cred no harm with the encounter, accidental or not. 4. Britain does better fly pasts than NATO  Honestly, the full might of the most successful military alliance in history and the best they can offer is 25 helicopters?  This poor show came exactly 24 hours after the biggest ever fly past in the UK, when 100 – yes A HUNDRED – aircraft flew up The Mall to mark the RAF\u0027s centenary. We sent Spitfires, a Lancaster bomber, Typhoons, Tornados and even F35 Lightning jets roaring across central London to the delights of thousands. NATO put on two dozen and one choppers – and despite the Mirror asking for a full breakdown of the various helicopters taking part, answer came there none. Embarrassing. 5. Even Theresa May struggles in heels occasionally  The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland regularly speaks of her love for shoes and her register of interests has previously shown discount cards for two leading footwear brands. So what follows next definitely isn\u0027t sexist.

President Trump’s visit alone will require around 10,000 officers, borrowed from every force in the country. When JFK came in 1961, he was met with a cheering crowd of over half a million people. That’s before we had an unashamed racist in the White House. When Trump arrives on Friday tens of thousands will attend protests around the country. More worrying, we’ll see marches from his supporters amongst the far right with a track record of violence.  This is a man, let’s not forget, who openly quoted far-right group Britain First called for a total ban on all Muslims entering the United States which would have extended to our own Mayor of London said all Haitain immigrants have AIDS and reportedly said laziness is a trait in black people. As our brilliant, diverse football team has got within touching distance of the World Cup, we’re welcoming a man who has built his career in politics on whipping up hatred. The police operation for his visit will be enormous, just when Tory cuts have reduced their numbers to the lowest in living memory.  Officers from across the country are being sent to protect Trump, leaving towns and cities across the UK ill-protected. One Chief Constable has even said he doesn’t know how he will keep the show on the road. With crowds gathering for a World Cup final this is leaving police forces unacceptably stretched and the public at risk. Think of the toll on police officers, who have been run ragged in recent times as their numbers have been recklessly slashed as crime has rocketed and more and more often their leave is cancelled in response to crises like the terror attacks or other peaks in demand. It is simply dangerous to keep asking our police officers to do more and more without giving them the time they need to recuperate. It means our police become less and less resilient and less able to respond to the challenges of civil emergencies or terrorist attack.

Spa-goer Kate Sanderson was out strolling with a friend when she spotted the black feline shape stalking through the grounds at 8.40pm on Saturday. The HR manager quickly grabbed her camera and filmed the beast as it prowled across the golf course at Ardencote Manor Hotel in Lye Green, Warwickshire. The panther-like creature, which Kate insists was far too big to be a domestic cat, can be seen walking across the grass at the course\u0027s half-way point and pausing occasionally as if to glare at them. Kate, 51, said she didn\u0027t stick around long enough to see what it did next and quickly returned to the four-star 19th century mansion. A hotel representative claimed it is a \u0027very well fed\u0027 feral cat that is friends with the groundsman, but Kate remains unconvinced.  Kate from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, said: You don\u0027t expect that kind of shock on an evening stroll. It was a lot bigger than a Labrador and certainly longer. It was approximately two to three feet high to the shoulders. I have two domestic cats at home and it was so much bigger. It\u0027s not what you would expect to see on a golf course - let alone a calming spa weekend. All I can say is, I wouldn\u0027t want to meet it on a dark night. Kate claims that, after spotting a panther when younger, she knew from its size that the cat was not just someone\u0027s pet. Having worked on a farm many years ago she has seen first-hand the damage caused by big cats and knew this sighting was no different. Kate said: It was obviously a big cat and neither of us felt like approaching it.  We went a little bit closer so I could film it as it walked between the trees. You can see the size of it in comparison to the grass - it\u0027s much bigger than a domestic cat. At that point it spotted us and turned around to face us. She added: I worked on a livestock farm and one spring our sheep suffered a vicious attack that was confirmed as being by a large cat - not a dog or regular predator. Two years prior to that I had seen a very large black cat jumping into a hedgerow a couple of miles from there early one morning. There were many known sightings of the Rutland panther. I did ask the hotel staff and a number of them said it\u0027s known that there\u0027s a big cat in the area. Despite Kate being certain what she saw was much larger than any domestic cat, a representative from Ardencote Manor Hotel claimed it was a feral domestic cat that had lived on the grounds for five years. The spokesperson said: It is just a very large domestic cat which has gone feral.

His dad, Ryan and mum, Barbara, made the decision to take Harry and his older brother, Thomas, out of school to give them lifelong memories. Tickets for the big game tonight has set the O\u0027Learys, from Harrow, North West London, back an eye-popping \u0026pound5,000. But it\u0027s money well spent for the footie-mad family, who said they wouldn\u0027t want their sons to miss it for the word.  Dad Ryan, 43, said: I\u0027ve taken the boys out of school and I don\u0027t regret it one bit. We wouldn\u0027t miss this for the world. And if we win tonight, we\u0027re staying for the final. We are QPR fans and this is just an amazing opportunity for our family to see England in the semi-finals of the World Cup This memory will live with our sons for the rest of their lives. Most of the schools in Harrow will finish for the summer holidays on July 25.  Harry\u0027s older brother Thomas, who is also missing school for the match, flew out to meet the rest of his family last night, along with his uncle. The boys\u0027 mum Barbara, 41, said: He was on a school trip in Spain when we came out to watch England play in Swedenin Samara. So he flew out with my brother-in-law last night via Zurich so he could watch the game tonight.  Footage of Harry at one of the matches showed him being lifted into the air on the shoulder of fellow fans. Other pictures of the young football fan shows him beaming in front of stadiums and standing with fellow fans. Around 10,000 Three Lions fans have flocked to Moscow in time for tonight\u0027s semi-final showdown. Many still didn’t have tickets as they made their way to the city the day before the match - with thousands expected to watch in pubs. The first supporters in Red Square were from Tamworth FC. They unfurled their giant flag and Russians queued to have their photo taken with it. Barry Walker, 53, of Cheltenham, Glos, is travelling with friends Jon Round, 54, and Dave Wiseman, 55.

And they are coming here because this time football is coming home. Come on England!” In The Lion’s Head pub, a stone’s throw from Red Square, one member of staff joked: “We’re going to re-name it Three Lions Head this week.” "},{"url":null,"title":"england fans faces reveal nations","story":"NewsEngland fans\u0027 faces reveal nation\u0027s heartbreak after losing World Cup semi-final against CroatiaSupporters were jubilant across the country when Kieran Trippier began the game with a free kick goal in under five minutes, but the Three Lions\u0027 lucky streak ended in misery\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJoshua TaylorAssistant news editorMatthew Young21:45, 11 JUL 2018Updated23:03, 11 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMillions of fans across the country drowned their sorrows tonight as England’s brave World Cup effort came to a devastating end. But despite the loss, Gareth Southgate’s men were lauded by supporters after a tournament that should be seen as a huge success for our young team. There had been wild scenes at fan parks and pubs across England as partying Three Lions supporters prepared for history to be made after Kieran Trippier’s fifth-minute goal gave us the lead. But, sadly, it was not to be as our young players were unable to overcome a talented Croatia side in Moscow. Closer to home, fans in Bristol held their heads in their hands and wept. Some threw drinks to the ground and stormed out of the Ashton Gate Stadium fan zone but others were more philosophical. Josh Quinn, 22, from Bristol, said: “It was a disappointing performance from England. The first half was amazing and the second half was terrible. I feel disappointed but proud.” Max Pemberton, 24, from Gloucester, had worn a waistcoat like Southgate’s to watch the match. “I’m devastated,” he said. “They have done so well. I’m devastated for them. It is the first time in our \u0026shylifetime that we have seen a semi-final. I really thought we would see a final though.”  Roads across the country were empty as England’s biggest match since 1990 was taking place. Some 30 million fans were glued to screens at fan parks, in pubs and in the comfort of their own homes. An incredible 30,000 crammed into London’s Hyde Park for the \u0026shycapital’s biggest screening of a match since the European Championships in 1996. The crowd went berserk as the team went ahead – as they did across the country. Those watching on huge screens were drenched in beer as plastic cups flew amid wild celebrations. Deborah Lowe, 57, of Walthamstow, East London, was one of the many new fans Gareth Southgate’s men have gained after the incredible run. She said after Trippier’s goal: “That was \u0026shyunexpected and exciting. “I’m not usually a football fan but the way this team has been playing has made me get behind them and I’m now hooked.” Beer was thrown through the air even before the match in Hyde Park as the Lightning Seeds, the band behind the Football’s Coming Home anthem, gave supporters a rendition of the tune that has galvanised the nation once again. The capital’s chaotic scenes of celebration after the scoring opened were echoed at all the fan parks and pubs.  But the mood gradually changed as the match went on and jubilant chants of \u0026shy“football’s coming home” turned slowly into nervous silence. Manchester had three venues screening the match, with Castlefield Bowl, Victoria Warehouse and Albert Hall all packed. In Leeds, the city’s Millennium Square was awash with white and red. Brighton beach once again held a showing for supporters on the south coast and Birmingham’s Archway outdoor cinema was the venue for fans in England’s second city. Like other venues, Box Park in Croydon went berserk when England scored. In Liverpool the Pier Head was rammed with supporters, as was Times Square in Newcastle. Nottingham and Stockport also hosted screenings. Some 20 million pints were sold across the country before kick-off. And it was estimated that 50,000 beers were thrown into the air when the Three Lions took the lead.

It\u0027s the first time the Three Lions have reached this stage in the competition since 1990, and people are starting to believe it really is finally coming home  While most big events have been rearranged or rescheduled so they don\u0027t clash with the big match, one primary school is refusing to move their play, reports Bristol Live .  This means children and their parents will miss England go head-to-head with Croatia - and will instead be transported to Fairytale Land for their production of Shrek the Musical.  Year 5 and 6 children at Pucklechurch Primary School in Bristol will take to the stage bang on 7pm for their production. About 50 children have spent the past month getting ready for the production ahead of two performances - one last night and one this evening. Parents are outraged that headteacher David Forrester has refused to move the start time. One parent, who asked not to be name for fear of the fall-out, said parents were flabbergasted when they arrived at school on Monday, expecting the show to be rescheduled. She said: Everyone assumed after England won on Saturday that the headteacher would postpone Wednesday\u0027s show. Or at least, arrange it to be on earlier on Wednesday, or move it to Thursday.  There\u0027s so many ways round it - the whole nation is coming to a standstill for this, other major sporting events are being changed, but not Shrek the Musical at little Pucklechurch Primary School, it\u0027s absolutely crazy. Parents were further angered when David told pupils if they intended to pull out of Wednesday\u0027s production to watch the football, they would be replaced for Tuesday\u0027s show, too. One said: He threatened all the children that if they \u0027don\u0027t come tomorrow night they will be letting the whole school down\u0027. All the year 5 and 6s are upset, I\u0027ve got a child that\u0027s upset about it.  Parents took to a closed Facebook group for parents and grandparents at the school, where one parent labelled the headteacher\u0027s actions \u0027very petty and childish\u0027.  Another said: This whole thing is shocking.  My child is really upset. I feel like she\u0027s been emotionally blackmailed. But David said he saw no reason to change the time or date of the production.  He told Bristol Live number of pupils had dropped out of the production so they could watch the match, and it was only fair to those still involved that they did so.  He said: Why would we change the time or date? We have had a couple of parents who have expressed their concerns about it, but we\u0027d sorted all of this out on Tuesday by giving those children and parents who wanted to watch the football the option of dropping out.

She had been eagerly looking forward to the big night after her GCSE exams when the bombshell diagnosis turned her life upside down. But her caring friends were so determined she did not miss out that they secretly organised her very own prom so Molly could go to the ball. Molly was speechless and burst into tears when her school pals revealed details of ‘The Secret Prom’ in her honour, Birmingham Live reports. In July 2017, Molly received a shock diagnosis of stage four non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after tests at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital. “After my last exam, my mum took me to the doctor,” says Molly, who lives in Cannock, Staffs. “We assumed I might have asthma, I didn’t really think about anything else. “It never even crossed my mind it would ever be cancer.”  Molly’s started chemotherapy the very next day. She bravely endured five rounds, later followed by three weeks of radiotherapy. After picking up her GCSE results where she received five A*s, two As, and three B grades, Molly had to return to hospital. That’s why she had to miss out on the school prom night – and plans for ‘The Secret Prom’ were begun. “I was gutted to miss the prom,” admits Molly, 17. “I was going to go with my friends and I just felt like I was missing out on it and all the plans we made for the summer. “All the way through Year 11 there is such a big build-up to the prom. Everyone gets excited about it and it’s a great chance to say goodbye to your friends. “You work so hard all year for your GSCEs and the prom is a good way to celebrate. “It was hard to see all the Instagram posts and snapchat stories in my hospital bed. It upset me to see it all.”  What Molly did not know was that best friends Harriet Murray, Caitlin Cooper, Bekky Dudley and Joanna Antoszkiewicz from Cardinal Griffin Catholic College in Cannock were hard at work organising their own event. The girls invited fellow pupils, teachers and Molly’s family to the special charity night to raise vital funds and awareness for CLIC Sargent, a charity that helped her family through her cancer battle. “The hardest part was keeping it a secret from Molly. Literally everyone knew except for her,” says Harriet. “Through the event we gathered together family, friends and even past teachers who knew Molly and were willing to show their support. “Finally, we can say that we gave Molly the prom night she deserved.” On the big night the girls all got dressed up at Molly’s house, telling her they’d booked a table at a charity night. Before they were about to leave the girls finally revealed their plan.

Passenger Emma Fitzpatrick says Mark Boon, Head of Network Operations of parent company Govia, told passengers to stay out of the cart on a late and very packed service. He is then said to have spread out in comfort - placing his bag on the empty seat beside him - while customers had to squeeze into the rammed doorway and adjoining carriage. The image has sparked outrage on social media among Southern Rail passengers who have endured months of delays amid strikes by staff. Hair stylist Emma, from Croydon, South London, claims Mr Boon was even handing his business card out to passengers as he turned them away.  Sharing the photo on Twitter, Emma wrote: Totally shocked to see #GoviaRailway Head of Operations, Mark Boon, telling all commuters to stay out of an EMPTY First Class carriage on a LATE \u0026amp very packed train this morning. Meanwhile he took up two seats IN there. She continued: It was a London-bound Southern train that arrived into London Victoria at approx 11.45am this morning. I still can\u0027t believe it. He even handed his business card out to the people that he was turning away! Talk about rubbing salt into commuters wounds.  Emma said that she joined the train mid-route before it terminated at London Victoria. She described the other passengers as a nice, quiet bunch of people. Mr Boon is Head of Network Operations at GTR (Govia Thameslink Railway), which operates Thameslink, Southern, Great Northern, and the Gatwick Express. His LinkedIn profile boasts of a career history spanning nearly 30 years that combines successful project management and day to delivery. He was crowned \u0027Customer Service Manager of the Year\u0027 while working for South West Trains in 2015. And within 24 hours of sharing the photo, Emma\u0027s tweet had been shared 350 times - with plenty of outraged Twitter users sharing their disdain.  Richie Northcote wrote: Disgusting. There’s going to be some kind of commuter/passenger revolt soon, I can feel it bubbling.

And Twitter account GoblinUsers, of Barking and Gospel Oak Rail Users\u0027 Group, said: Having had dealings with him in a past life when he was a station manager around 2003, I am shocked and amazed to see him in such a senior position.

The Met Office have issued a yellow weather warning for thunder for south east England and Wales with some locations set to get 2cm of rain in just an hour. Friday will start of dry and fine for much of the country but rising temperatures will usher in thunder and lightening by late morning. The warning is in place from 11am to 8pm when forecasters expect the weather will clear and be largely dry overnight. There is a risk of flooding and forecasters are warning drivers to expect hazardous conditions on the roads.  A Met Office spokesperson said: On Thursday it\u0027s a dry day across England. There will be much more in the way of dry weather, in the north west especially, but still little a bit of rain across Northern Ireland and Scotland. London will see temperatures of 26C - 27C. Moving north it will be between 22C and 26C and in Scotland around 17C or 18C.  Friday will be a fine day for many. The north east will be quite clear with sunshine. But moving into late morning rising temperatures will bring scattered heavy showers particularly in the south west. People can expect risk of flooding and those driving, spray and surface waters on the roads. There is a risk of lightening strikes hitting and damaging the power supply to services. This will gradually move away in the evening. The warning comes after forecasters warned 2018 will see the hottest summer ever recorded following weeks of sizzling temperatures.  Brits have flocked to beaches, parks and swimming pools to soak up the sun in recent weeks that\u0027s been so strong it\u0027s smashed a series of records. Sunday July 8 was the hottest day of the year so far with Gosport in Hampshire recording a temperature of 32.4C. Moving into the weekend, on Saturday there will be some cloud and chances of showers across the country, meaning it will feel a lot cooler.

And the \u0026pound200m Air Force One - a Boeing VC-25A - is so big President Donald Trump reportedly once got lost showing wife Melania around. Over the past year, we have become accustomed to seeing a windswept Trump as he makes his way down those famous red plane stairs. It is dubbed his flying Oval Office and is set over three levels, with beige interior, brown leather seats, dark oak, star-print carpet and fridges equipped to handle 3,000 meals. But despite the high-spec fridges Trump had installed earlier this year, he\u0027s more likely to be spotted tucking into fast food.  Elsewhere inside is an extensive suite for the President with a large office, lavatory, and conference room. Air Force One includes a medical suite that can function as an operating room, and a doctor is permanently on board. Meanwhile, the plane’s two food preparation galleys can feed 100 people at a time. It also has quarters for those who accompany the President, including senior advisors, Secret Service officers, travelling press, and other guests. Several cargo planes typically fly ahead of Air Force One to provide the President with services needed in remote locations.  The plane is emblazoned with the words United States of America, the American flag, and the Seal of the President of the United States which can even be found on the seatbelts. The plane costs around \u0026pound116,000 per hour to keep the ultimate in presidential privileges in the air, boasting 87 phones, 19 TVs and a gym, among other facilities. It also operates as an airborne military command centre, with secure global satellite communications and TV studio facilities allowing the president to address the nation from the air. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York, AF1 had to land to allow George W Bush to make a speech. And in the event of a nuclear attack, AF1 is protected from the electromagnetic pulse of a blast that would otherwise knock out a plane’s electronics by 238 miles of wiring. Other equipment includes flares capable of diverting heat-seeking missiles.  Every flight is classified as a military operation, with security crews conducting thorough checks on the plane and runway at Maryland’s Andrews Air Force Base ahead of take off. The aircraft is also fitted with its own baggage-loader to avoid sharing any airport’s facilities. Secret service agents are also permitted to shoot on sight on board, remaining armed at all times. It also has the capability of being able to fly the best part of a third of the way around the world without refuelling (although it has been converted for in-flight topping up). The term Air Force One describes any particular Air Force aircraft carrying the president. But today, this name commonly refers to one of two highly customized Boeing 747-200B that have been especially modfiied. The exterior is blue and white.  How much does the pilot of Air Force One get paid? It\u0027s not clear exactly how much they get paid and depends on the pilot’s rank and how long they have been in the military But an entry-level officer with three years of experience earns about $47,000 annually (\u0026pound35,524), as of 2017. A top-ranking colonel with three years of experience earns around $92,000 (\u0026pound69,538) a year. How do you become a pilot of Air Force One? Becoming an Air Force pilot requires a commitment to the U.S. Air Force, extensive training and testing, and a degree. Firstly, it\u0027s recommended you get a Bachelor\u0027s Degree in aviation or related areas to help completely flight training and courses in aircraft systems, aviation laws, and so on.

Researchers have found ancient tools in China which they believe may indicate primitive humans were in the area as early as 2.12million years ago. These tools are around 270,000 years older than the bones and stone tools found in Dmanisi, Georgia. The research was carried out a by Chinese - British team and their findings have been published in the scientific journal, Nature.  The finding was made at Shangchen on a plateau in northern China, reports the BBC .   The artefacts are different stone tools which all show signs of being used. Many were made out of quartzite and quartz rock which probably came from the Qinling Mountains, which are about five to 10km away from where they were discovered. However, it is not known which human species made them. People living outside Africa can trace their origins to a departure around 60,000 years ago. This evidence is so important as the earliest indication of humans in Eurasia was from the site in Georgia, which dated to 1.8million years ago. Co-author Prof Robin Dennell, from the University of Exeter, UK, said: Our discovery means it is necessary now to reconsider the timing of when early humans left Africa. Africa has traditionally been seen as the place where species arose before heading out to the rest of the world. But some scientists have said Asia has an important place in the story of human evolution. This new evidence will make some researchers question how far back the human story goes in Asia.

Twitter bosses say they have identified tens of millions of questionable accounts they will remove without warning. Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice president for trust and safety, told The New York Times: We don’t want to incentivize the purchase of followers and fake accounts to artificially inflate follower counts, because it’s not an accurate measure of someone’s influence on the platform or influence in the world.

You play for the glory and to win things.“If you are asked, you would say you would love to leave a legacy and Gillie has certainly done that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b434788ba270-719x564.jpg ","title":"a true legend dundee fc league winner pays tribute to exceptional dark blues and tottenham striker alan gilzean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn exceptional striker and a lovely man who was never changed by stardom.That’s how Dundee legend Alan Gilzean is described by fellow Dens Park great and championship winning team-mate Bob Seith.Gilzean died on Sunday at the age of 79, less than a month after it was revealed he was battling a brain tumour.It was a sad day for Seith, one of four surviving members of the Dark Blues greatest-ever side, but he was able to recall the many happy memories of his friend and colleague.“It’s sad news and my thoughts are with Alan’s family,” he said.“I was just thinking about him the other day and wondering how he was, so it’s sad to hear of his passing.”Recalling their time together, what Seith highlighted first was Gilzean’s superstar status on the park was matched by being a class act off it.“Alan was an exceptional striker for Dundee and Tottenham, but that never changed him. He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b44846f6daa4-752x564.jpg ","title":"bbc radio 4 listening project broadcasts from dundee this week","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA radio project which is collecting stories from the public is being hosted by the city’s Verdant Works all this weekThe award-winning former jute mill at West Henderson’s Wynd, now a popular visitor attraction, is temporarily home to BBC Radio 4’s The Listening Project from 10am-5pm until Friday and local residents are being invited to stop off and make their own contributions.A mobile unit is parked at Verdant Works, where the public can share their stories on life, moments, memories and people – whatever they choose.By taking part they will also be creating history.

And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well. It’s a game we’re looking forward to.”Former Hearts goalie Hamilton has a rival for the gloves at Dens Park, with last season’s No 1 Parish having done well in the Dundee goal following the departure of Scott Bain.The 28-year-old has already issued a challenge to his new pal Hamilton ahead of the campaign that he’ll have a battle on his hands.It’s not one the new man is likely to shirk away from, however.He added: “I don’t think there’s anywhere there isn’t a battle for the gloves but it’s a fight I’m really up for and I want to be playing.“I got a good run at Hearts, 60-odd games but I’m here now to further that and I’m desperate to get more games and make myself better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”. And colleague, Hugh Hunter, added: “There are exciting times coming up for Maybole and the town has some real opportunities to flourish.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12884680.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/asr_ayp_210618Nicola3jpeg.jpg","title":"meet weeks wedding week","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Wedding of the WeekNicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie16:46, 9 JUL 2018NewsJohn and Nicola share a moment (Image: Kevin Moulds Photography)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis week’s Wedding of the Week bride is Ayrshire’s own Award Winning Classical Artist Nicola Cassells. Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"feature-peebles-pupils-meditate-their-way-to-mindfulness","story":"IT\u0027S a typical weekday, high school students are lying on the floor of their classroom, eyes closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control? They\u0026rsquod disembarked at station 108, where Peeblesshire\u0026rsquos very own princess of peace resides.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"eildon-achieve-excellence-in-quality-management","story":"MANAGEMENT at Eildon Housing have been recognised for achieving excellence.\nStaff from the Selkirk-based provider were awarded four stars by the European Foundation for Quality Management.\nAnd they have managed to reach pass marks in all nine Excellence Model criteria set by the Foundation within three years.\nEildon\u0026rsquos chief executive Nile Istephan is delighted with the award.\nHe told us: \u0026ldquoThis is another fantastic recognition for the work of the Eildon Group and all of our staff who work hard to deliver ever improving services to our customers.\n\"To have achieved such a speedy progression through this demanding framework in only three years is a great achievement and we are very proud of our colleagues for their efforts.\n\"This award demonstrates our continuing focus on business improvement, building on the organisation\u0026rsquos strengths to attain even higher levels of excellence throughout our entire operation and we are absolutely delighted to receive four-star recognition.\"\nEildon are currently beginning a record-breaking expansion programme of house-building across the Borders.\nThe Quality Management award was made at the recent Scottish Business Awards.\nClaire Ford, chief executive officer of Quality Scotland added: \"Eildon Housing Association\u0026rsquos achievement of Recognised for Excellence Four Star, in their first assessment, is a clear demonstration of an organisation\u0026rsquos drive and desire to achieve sustainable business excellence and truly embed a culture of continuous improvement.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scary-start-to-sun-kissed-earlston-civic-week","story":"DON\u0027T expect too many crows to drop in on this year\u0027s Earlston Civic Week.\nTo herald the start of this week\u0027s fun-packed festival scarecrows have been placed all entrances to the town as well as a few locations around the centre.\nAnd they will stay there until the Civic Week conclusion this weekend.\nVillagers have already enjoyed a day of pub games at the Red Lion as well as a ramble, car treasure hunt and a football tournament during the weekend.\nAnd on Monday the ever-popular pet show took place at the Cauldie beneath beautiful blue skies, along with a duck race and barbecue.\nLast (Tuesday) night athletes of all ages and abilities tackled the Black Hill in roasting hot temperatures.\nAnd throughout this afternoon a children\u0027s party will be held in the grand marquee, followed in the evening by the hotly contested quiz.\nEarlston\u0027s annual celebrations conclude this weekend with a Senior Citizens\u0027 bash in the marquee on Friday, followed by Scocha in concert and a late-night disco.\nAnd tomorrow the fabulous fancy dress parade takes place on Saturday afternoon ahead of the sports, torchlight parade and fireworks.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-water-urge-borderers-to-use-less-water-during-heatwave","story":"SCOTTISH Water is urging Borderers to use water wisely to help maintain supplies while the country basks in a prolonged heatwave.\nFollowing a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage for water has increased significantly.\nWith the current warm weather conditions forecast to continue, Scottish Water bosses are encouraging people to take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.\nIn some areas there has been a 30 percent increase in demand for water during the summer so far and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day to meet current customer usage.\nScottish Water has been monitoring the situation closely and are managing supplies across the country, including deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.\nSome water treatment works and distribution networks are also working at near capacity to meet demand.\nAverage reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year, but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.\nThe main advice for Borderers is to reduce water usage wherever possible.

\u0026ldquohotspots of lithium situated underground in Cornwall, researchers have said.\nGlobal demand for lithium, a vital component in \u0026ldquonext generation batteries for electric vehicles and storage for renewable power, is expected to grow by around 400% by 2025.\nLithium in hot brine springs in Cornwall could provide the UK with a domestic source of the metal, which has been described as \u0026ldquothe new gasoline due to its potential to help in the shift to low-carbon energy supplies.\nNow a study has shown that satellites can detect changes in vegetation and surface minerals, which, when combined with geological data, could indicate potential locations of lithium in the county once famous for its tin mines.\nThis kind of remote sensing could significantly cut the cost of lithium exploration and also reduce the environmental impact of mining by better targeting prospective sites, the team behind the research said.\nThe study of two areas of Cornwall combined different types of remote sensing techniques to better predict areas that may contain brine pools with lithium in them below the surface and identify target sites for further work.\nAlong with other measures such as heat mapping and geological faults, the team looked for potential indicators of lithium in vegetation cover for example, how healthy plants are, to help indicate where hotspots of lithium might be.\nProspectors could then drill down into the ground to pump out the hot, salty water which contains lithium and extract the metal rather than needing large-scale open-cast mines.\nThe team have also used the same range of satellite data to create an map showing where important habitats, flood risk areas and towns are situated to help with environmental monitoring of future mining.\nDr Cristian Rossi, principal Earth observation specialist, Satellite Applications Catapult, who led the\u0026nbspstudy, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe are very excited by the findings of this project.\n\u0026ldquoThis approach to lithium exploration, which includes the estimation of multiple surface indicators, has not been attempted before and may be highly applicable across the wider mining industry.\n\u0026ldquoWe have shown that by combining a range of satellite data and expertise in UK mining, geology and Earth Observation, we can accurately map the environmental\u0026nbspbaseline and also delineate areas where lithium is more likely to be present at depth.\n\u0026ldquoThese are the first digital maps that display potential lithium hotspots for initial investigation and\u0026nbspvalidation.\nJeremy Wrathall, founder and chief executive of project partner Cornish Lithium, said: \u0026ldquoThe results of the study, and our collaboration with other project partners, has enabled our company to significantly\u0026nbspadvance our exploration programme and to better prioritise areas on which to focus our exploration for\u0026nbsplithium-bearing brines in Cornwall.\nThe team was led by the Satellite Applications Catapult, established to transform the UK\u0026rsquos capability for innovation in the technology and

Here is the CCC response and some comments:Campbeltown Community Council: \u0026#8216Suggested crossing places: It has come to our attention that an online petition has been created to put in place safety measures at these crossing places.\u0026#8216The community council has been campaigning for safety measures for some time.\u0026#8216Alan Baker, chairman of Campbeltown Community Council, Councillor Donald Kelly and Andy Hemmings of Kintyre Crime Prevention met with a representative of Transport Scotland to discuss the \u0026#8216suggested crossing places\u0026#8217 at the Co-operative and the Royal Hotel, which the members of the community council consider to be unsafe.\u0026#8216They were told there have been no accidents or near misses reported to Transport Scotland, Police Scotland or any of our councillors.\u0026#8216However Transport Scotland did suggest removing these road markings and putting in place a proper crossing near the Aqualibrium.\u0026#8216If you or anyone you know has been involved in a near miss, please report it to the police.Isabel Melville: \u0026#8216Transport Scotland has it wrong. The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

bag on a school trip to France when they blew it up in a controlled explosion.Christopher, aged 11, a pupil at Castlehill School, was visiting a school in Lourmarin near Marseilles with a group of Kintyre school children, and in the excitement, his bag was mislaid at the airport.Christopher\u0026#8217s bag contained his personal stereo, his camera and, most important, his inhaler for asthma.At first, he said, he was not aware the bag had been lost, but after they arrived at Lourmarin and the bus was emptied, he realised it was missing.He immediately informed the teachers in charge of the group and Francois Bonnard, a French teacher who had visited Campbeltown, phoned the airport to be told that the bag had been found, and after investigation by security, had been blown up.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr James Gulliver, the head of the Fine Fare Group of stores and supermarkets, said at the school prize-giving ceremony that the opportunities in management careers were great and stimulating and they were open to all.He said he was proud to have been asked to speak to the pupils because of the honour accorded him by the invitation and because of the debt he felt he owed to the school and because of his affection for Campbeltown and Scotland.The subject of his address was the ingredients of a successful business career and the opportunities and rewards in business.He said: \u0026#8216I do hope many of the boys and girls here will take up a business, commercial or management career because people in these fields are sorely needed in Britain today.’ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOWe are pleased to learn of the further successes of two young Campbeltown brothers, Masters Ronald and Peter McCallum, sons of Mr Archibald McCallum, Millknowe, in bagpipe and dancing competitions in the Emerald

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Lithium in hot brine springs in Cornwall could provide the UK with a domestic source of the metal, which has been described as \u0026ldquothe new gasoline due to its potential to help in the shift to low-carbon energy supplies.  Now a study has shown that satellites can detect changes in vegetation and surface minerals, which, when combined with geological data, could indicate potential locations of lithium in the county once famous for its tin mines.  This kind of remote sensing could significantly cut the cost of lithium exploration and also reduce the environmental impact of mining by better targeting prospective sites, the team behind the research said.  The study of two areas of Cornwall combined different types of remote sensing techniques to better predict areas that may contain brine pools with lithium in them below the surface and identify target sites for further work.  Along with other measures such as heat mapping and geological faults, the team looked for potential indicators of lithium in vegetation cover for example, how healthy plants are, to help indicate where hotspots of lithium might be.  Prospectors could then drill down into the ground to pump out the hot, salty water which contains lithium and extract the metal rather than needing large-scale open-cast mines.  The team have also used the same range of satellite data to create an map showing where important habitats, flood risk areas and towns are situated to help with environmental monitoring of future mining.  Dr Cristian Rossi, principal Earth observation specialist, Satellite Applications Catapult, who led the\u0026nbspstudy, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe are very excited by the findings of this project.  \u0026ldquoThis approach to lithium exploration, which includes the estimation of multiple surface indicators, has not been attempted before and may be highly applicable across the wider mining industry.  \u0026ldquoWe have shown that by combining a range of satellite data and expertise in UK mining, geology and Earth Observation, we can accurately map the environmental\u0026nbspbaseline and also delineate areas where lithium is more likely to be present at depth.  \u0026ldquoThese are the first digital maps that display potential lithium hotspots for initial investigation and\u0026nbspvalidation.  Jeremy Wrathall, founder and chief executive of project partner Cornish Lithium, said: \u0026ldquoThe results of the study, and our collaboration with other project partners, has enabled our company to significantly\u0026nbspadvance our exploration programme and to better prioritise areas on which to focus our exploration for\u0026nbsplithium-bearing brines in Cornwall.

The football coach, whose team take on Croatia today for a place in the World Cup final in Russia, has propelled the clothing item without which no three-piece suit would be complete back back into the fashion limelight thanks to his smart appearance on the touchline.  And with England fans adopting the garment as their personal talisman in their hunt for football glory, it has now emerged that Mr Southgate\u0027s waistcoat is to be preserved for the nation with The Museum of London announcing plans to acquire one his suits as part of their permanent collection.  Joining treasures from around the world, the plan is to display the garment at the museum\u0027s new building in the north of London.  Beatrice Behlen, Museum of London Senior Fasion Curator said:\"The Museum of London has a large fashion collection with garments ranging from the 16th century to the present.  \"Our earliest waistcoat dates from the late 17th century, our most recent from 2014. This acquisition would be a fantastic addition to our holdings and would come at an exciting time for us while we build the London Collection as we plan the New Museum in West Smithfield.\"  The traditional three piece suit - trousers, jacket and waistcoat - was a key part of British fashion for centuries, with an integral role in men\u0026rsquos wardrobes until the 1960s.  However, they have since fallen out of fashion with the rise of a more business-casual look.  But the history of the waistcoat actually predates the business suit by several centuries, with the first example, which had sleeves, recorded by the 17th century writer and politician Samuel Pepys.  Pepys, a regular at the royal court, recorded that King Charles II intended to set a new fashion with a \"vest\", which he would wear the next day.  While not quite a vest in the modern sense, the item as a departure from the frock cots popular at the time and is regarded as the first waistcoat.  Ms Behlen, added: \"Waistcoats were born in London in 1666, promoted by King Charles II. The new fashion soon spread and for at least 300 years a three piece suit soon formed a key part of every man\u0026rsquos wardrobe.  \"Now Watford-born Gareth Southgate is reviving that London tradition and bringing waistcoats home to the forefront of fashion.\"  Fashions change over time, and during the 1750s the garment was shortened to the length familiar to suit-wearers and sports fans today.  Since then it has been cemented into British culture the waistcoat, although has undergone slight alterations.  In the late 1800s it became popular to leave the bottom button undone, a fashion supposedly started by the courtiers who surrounded Edward VII, who was too rotund to do up his.  The garment also retains royal connections of a darker sort in Scotland, with Jacobites said to toast the \"wee gentleman in the velvet waistcoat\" - in reference to moles - because of William of Orange\u0027s death after falling from a horse which had tripped on a molehill.  A long-sleeved version of the waistcoat said to have belonged to Bonnie Prince Charlie, was featured by the National Museum of Scotland during last year\u0026rsquos Jacobites exhibition  But before fans of the England team get too carried away with making an icon out of Mr Southgate\u0027s wardrobe it should be remembered that the necktie - which no three piece suit should be without - was invented in Croatia."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055800.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"snps-james-dornan-calls-on-glasgow-city-council-to-ban-orange-walk","story":"  The SNP\u0026rsquos James Dornan has also criticised Police Scotland\u0026rsquos handling of the incident which saw Canon Tom White - of St Alphonsus Church in the Barras - be spat on twice before being lunged at by a man with a baton.

President Quim Torra, who backs independence for the region, was sworn in by Catalonia\u0027s parliament in May.  He is due to meet with Prof Ponsati before joining the First Minister at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, later in the day.  Prof Ponsati, an academic at St Andrews University, denies the charges against her.  Her legal team, who describe the prosecution as \"politically motivated\" by Spain, says she could face a total sentence of up to 33 years if she is sent there and convicted of the charges, raising fears the 61-year-old could spend the rest of her life in jail.  She faces a four-week hearing scheduled to take place in the summer.  Commenting on President Torra\u0027s visit, Prof Ponsati\u0027s lawyer Aamer Anwar said she \"greatly appreciated\" his support.  \"If extradited Clara Ponsati could face a sentence of up to 33 years in a Spanish prison,\" he said.  \"The prosecutor from the Crown Office acting on behalf of Spain considers an equivalent charge of rebellion can be met in Scotland with a charge of conspiracy to alter the constitution by criminal means and treason.  \"Clara refutes the charges and maintains that she peacefully promoted a referendum, whilst the charges against her are \u0027politically motivated\u0027 and extradition would be unjust, oppressive and incompatible with her human rights.\""},{"url":null,"title":"fox-raises-bid-for-sky-to-14-a-share","story":"  Fox\u0026rsquos new offer\u0026nbspfor the 61% of Sky it does not already own values the company at \u0026pound24.5 billion.  It said the offer was around 12% higher than the \u0026pound12.50-a-share bid submitted by US cable group Comcast.  Fox\u0026rsquos sweetened bid is also around 30.2% higher than its original \u0026pound10.75-a-share bid made in December 2016, which valued the 61% stake at \u0026pound11.7 billion.  Its move signals that Fox hopes to see off competition from Comcast after a long battle to buy out Sky, which has come under heavy scrutiny from the UK Government and competition watchdogs.  Earlier this month, then UK culture secretary Matt Hancock said Fox would have to sell off Sky News in order to address media plurality concerns and secure Government approval for the deal.  Fox has already agreed to sell most of its assets \u0026ndash including its current 39% stake in Sky \u0026ndash to Walt Disney.  If Fox buys the remaining stake in Sky before completing the Disney deal, Disney would take full ownership of Sky when it closes its own takeover of the Fox assets.  But in a further complication to the takeover saga, Comcast has also made an all-cash offer for the Fox assets separate from its offer for Sky.  Comcast is preparing to post details of its \u0026pound12.50-a-share Sky offer documents before a Friday deadline under UK takeover rules.  On its higher bid, Fox said: \u0026ldquoAs the founding shareholder of Sky, we have remained deeply committed to bringing these two organisations together to create a world-class business positioned to deliver the very best entertainment experiences well into the future.  \u0026ldquoWe strongly believe that a combined 21st Century Fox and Sky will be a powerful driver for the continued growth and vibrancy of the UK and broader global creative industries.  Sky shares fell nearly 2% following details of Fox\u0026rsquos raised bid.  Fox is waiting for a final decision from the UK Government on whether to accept its proposals over the sale of Sky News to address concerns over media plurality, given that the Murdoch family also owns News Corp \u0026ndash the publisher of a raft of UK newspapers.  Under its plans to offload Sky News to Disney, Fox has pledged to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least \u0026pound100 million a year for 15 years.  But if terms of a sale of Sky News cannot be agreed, Mr Hancock has already told Parliament the \u0026ldquoonly effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether.  A decision is expected by July 12.  The Government has separately cleared Comcast\u0026rsquos bid for Sky."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-parking-the-worst-in-the-uk","story":"  Topping the list of cities where the highest proportion of drivers make a claim for a parking accident and being the city with the second highest volume of PCNs issued per 100 cars makes Edinburgh the \u0027King of Problematic Parking\u0027, according to insurers Admiral.

Backbencher Andrew Bridgen became the first Tory MP to declare that he has sent a letter of no confidence in Mrs May to the\u0026nbspchairman of the backbench\u0026nbsp1922\u0026nbspCommittee, Sir Graham Brady. Some 48 letters are required to trigger a vote.  Writing in The Sun, arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg denounced the Chequers deal as \u0026ldquoa dud which \u0026ldquowill not deliver Brexit.  Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Tory Eurosceptics, said Mrs May would have to U-turn on her plans or rely on Labour votes to force them through Parliament.  And he warned: \u0026ldquoA government that depends upon the opposition to get its business through is like the gingerbread man on the back of the fox crossing the river.\u0026nbspAt the end of the journey it gets eaten.  But former Conservative leader William Hague warned party rebels that voting against the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos final deal could result in Brexit being indefinitely delayed or halted altogether.  And Mrs May herself insisted that her plan \u0026ndash agreed by the Cabinet on Friday, only for David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign days later \u0026ndash would make good on her promise to deliver Brexit.  Set to be published in a white paper on Thursday, the plan envisages Britain continuing to trade freely with the remaining EU in goods under a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook, while accepting restrictions on trade in services.  Arriving at the Nato summit in Brussels, the Prime Minister said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos there because it delivers on the vote that people gave on Brexit, it delivers the fact that we will have an end to free movement, we will have an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, we won\u0026rsquot be sending vast contributions to the EU every year, we\u0026rsquoll be out of the Common Agricultural Policy, out of the Common Fisheries Policy.  \u0026ldquoWe deliver that Brexit and we do it in a way that protects jobs and livelihoods and meets our commitment to Northern Ireland.  Unnamed Brexiteers were quoted in the press as saying the PM should brace herself for \u0026ldquoguerrilla war to kill off her deal, with Eurosceptic Tories withholding their support in the Commons.

We are supporting Theresa for PM.  Lord Hague told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme that he did not think that a free trade agreement alone would solve the twin issues of keeping the Irish border open and keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to a vote sometime around the end of this year, let us say that Theresa May has done a deal that bears some resemblance to what was put forward at Chequers with the EU.  \u0026ldquoIf anyone in the Conservative Party is then thinking about voting that down, that is the point at which they are going to endanger everything they have been trying to achieve.  \u0026ldquoThere is a whole range of scenarios in which they get no\u0026nbspBrexit, or an indefinitely delayed\u0026nbspBrexit, or a change of government or a second referendum.

Crowds gathered in London\u0027s Hyde Park, Millennium Square in Leeds, Nottingham Castle, Birmingham\u0027s Archway outdoor cinema - and even Los Angeles.

The 23-man England squad, which has an average age of just over 26 and was the tournament\u0027s third youngest, had the hopes and expectations of a nation on their shoulders.

The privately-owned firms operate two service lines from their headquarters in Huntly, comprising the development of private residential homes – mainly in Aberdeenshire – and the provision of design and build contracts for housing associations across the north of Scotland.        Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What’s more, on still summer evenings it’s really nice to hear the students’ voices echoing across the harbour before we set off to sail.As the Year of Young People progresses throughout 2018 Mr Garrett said that Serco Northlink will be continuing to celebrate this special year with additional partnerships with the local community and its youngest residents.”Leah Hamilton from Stromness Primary School was one of the pupils chosen for the recording, which she found very enjoyable.“It was great fun recording the announcement,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220It only took us a few attempts and we were pleased with the final message.“We know that safety is important when travelling anywhere so we hope that the new announcement will help NorthLink Ferries’ passengers listen to the briefing and follow the steps carefully.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Thursday 12 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766840.1531245886!/image/image.jpg","title":"henry mcleish scots need to ditch anyone but england attitude","story":"        Obsession with the \u0026#8216Auld Enemy\u0026#8217 is a distraction and Scotland must focus on creating its own team of footballing world-beaters, writes former first minister Henry McLeish.                Tonight, the World Cup semi-final between England and Croatia will attract record-breaking TV audiences, not only in England but in every part of the United Kingdom. For Scots, given our long memories of epic struggles with England on and off the pitch, who will we be supporting?            This has been an unpredictable and enjoyable World Cup, where Russia and Fifa have exceeded my expectations and have delivered a spectacular reminder of what the beautiful game represents. But England’s role in this festival of football, has, for Scots, always to be seen through the prism of history, identity, nationalism/patriotism, politics and yes, the irritating, arrogant and overblown remarks of English football commentators!            But let’s not overlook the major issue in this discussion – Scotland didn’t qualify for Russia. We haven’t qualified for 20 years, so our ambiguity and ambivalence towards England, is understandable in historical terms but irrelevant to our immediate and dire predicament as a declining football nation.England’s progress in the competition has benefitted from a very easy group stage, but no one should underestimate the improvements made under Gareth Southgate. England has done well so far and have never had a better chance to reach the final. If Scots want to support them, that’s okay by me, but I will retain my neutrality and hope that the best team wins, preferably without a penalty shoot-out. You can’t transfer your football loyalties, but you can certainly give praise where it is deserved. We need to learn from other countries, not resent what they are doing. It makes little sense for Scots to adopt the attitude “anyone but England”! Winning the World Cup is the “landing on the moon” moment for any footballer and their country. If Harry Kane is asked next Sunday to step up and accept the trophy as World Champions. What a fantastic achievement that would be and “well done England”.Our football relationship with the “Auld Enemy” goes back a long way. It is now time to recalibrate, move on and focus instead on our own dismal international football performance. This should be the focus of our anger, frustration, and national despair. We have wasted too much emotional energy on England and its football team over the years. Too often in the past our football rivalry has become a vehicle for the worst excesses of being Scottish. At a time of rapid modernisation, political renewal and a new sense of national confidence, there are bigger priorities.READ MORE: Scotland ‘could host World Cup 2030 matches as part of joint UK bid’On a recent visit to Inverness to deliver a talk on Brexit – another product of delusion, nostalgia, and sentiment on the part of England – I stopped to have a cup of coffee on the battlefield on Culloden Moor. This is always a good venue to charge batteries, not in any nostalgic nationalist way, but merely to enjoy a great historic place to reflect, in what is a strangely peaceful part of Scotland.            In 1746 Culloden was the last battle ever fought on British soil. The Jacobites were routed and destroyed by the Hanoverians in the same time it takes to play the first half of a Scottish Premier League game. Accepting a bit of historical license, let’s read Scotland versus England for Jacobites versus Hanoverians. So much historic and emotional capital has been invested in our games with England. This is not to say these historic clashes – with crowds we can now only dream about – didn’t matter. The fixture between Scotland and England was played annually between 1872 and 1983. In the early days of the game, after the SFA was created in 1873, the Scotland vs England match made a great deal of sense. These were the first two countries to form associations. Some of the games were spectacular battles, providing some magnificent football and some of the highest attendances ever seen in world football – ten of the largest attended games, attracted nearly 1.5 million fans at Hampden. But its importance, to Scottish football, was past its sell by date. In my view the Home Championship and the Scotland-England fixture – covering over a century of football – had become a major distraction for a country that needed to invest more in European and International football, direct the patriotism and nationalism of Scotland to bigger ambitions, and call time on a fixture that seemed to be more than just a football match. Defeating the Auld Enemy – not always guaranteed – became an obsession and a major distraction. It made sense for this fixture to be abandoned in 1983. I also enjoyed my own piece of nostalgia that day, thinking back to 1967 when Celtic won the European Cup and Scotland defeated England at Wembley where Jim Baxter tormented the English team, only a year after they had won the World Cup. Football memories are especially precious in a country where we seem to have stopped dreaming about future glory and have instead to content ourselves with arguing about who we should support in Scotland’s absence. We must get the Ghost of England Past off our back.READ MORE: Euphoria to defeat: the untold story of Scotland’s 1978 World Cup            Success can have a spectacular impact. I was enthused and inspired by the reaction of England to their victory over Sweden. Nearly half the population of their country watched on TV, it was party time and a nation celebrated the success of their team. The pride, passion and patriotism of a nation expressed through football was remarkable. But I wanted it to be Scotland. Why were we not there I kept asking myself? We think we have better fans than the English, so what if it had been Scotland clinching a penalty shoot-out or scoring a spectacular last-minute goal, what might our reaction have been?Everyone would have been glued to their TV screens, the country would have come to a standstill, and there would have been an incredible outpouring of national pride and that sense of achievement only success on the world stage can bring. This is the reality that should fire our desire for the transformation of the game in Scotland. Scotland has the potential to be successful. It has nothing to do with the size of population. It has nothing to do with England. It has everything to do with the size of our ambition and the determination to make the national team – both male and female – our number one priority.Our preoccupation with beating England, and on many occasions, hating England, may have been at the expense of investing more emotional capital and national fervour in other directions. Our football, like our politics, has too often seen England as an historical focus for our weaknesses and opprobrium, not our strengths and ambition.For 20 years and five World Cups, we have failed to qualify. We are fading fast from the minds of the international footballing community. This is not acceptable, neither is it inevitable. This crisis is home grown. The founding fathers of this great game must be turning in their graves, as we squander the legacy of the early years, ignore our undoubted football DNA, and replace the golden age of Scottish football, from the 60s to 90s, with decline, lesser ambitions for our national teams and a failure to take responsibility for what we are doing. The advent of devolution and the growth of nationalism have shifted some of our energy, enthusiasm, and passion for the game, away from football and in to politics. The time when nationalism was worn on the back of a football jersey is over. But hopefully we haven’t bought into the idea that the present state of the game is all we can expect. Scotland was a successful footballing nation with a self-belief that created so many legends and beautiful memories. Agonising over England isn’t going to solve our football problems but winning the World Cup might!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766791.1531292198!/image/image.jpg","title":"maggie chapman scots radicalised by indyref are ditching neo liberalism","story":"        The politics of SNP are, as might be expected from a \u0026#8216national\u0026#8217 party, representative of politics more broadly, both in Scotland and throughout Western Europe. We are at a point of rupture between neo-liberal consensus and several competing programmes for the future.                In 2014, the SNP-led Scottish Government produced a white paper that set out a vision of continuity: an independent Scotland would be slightly better in every regard than a devolved Scotland, but would not be in any way different (we would keep the monarchy, Sterling, the dominant economic model etc). As such, it was a manifestation of the dominant politics of that period: all changes proposed were in continuity with the prevailing system rather than seeking to change it.            It now appears that this was one of the final acts of that period of neo-liberal consensus: the Scottish independence referendum opened up a new, radically different space for politics in which the old certainties had truly melted into air.             A referendum that was supposed to change nothing but the constitutional status of Scotland appears to have changed everything but the constitutional status of Scotland. We have ended up with an ever more energised public making their opinions felt on issues as diverse as fracking and the renewal of local democracy. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: Growth Commission report candid about indy challengesAn SNP Government most comfortable managing a neo-liberal consensus has been pushed into all sorts of uncomfortable positions as the rupture in our politics opens up the earth beneath them.In the last couple of years, I have found Gramsci’s analysis that “the old world is dying, the new world cannot yet be born” becomes truer by the day. And this brings us to the Growth Commission: it is an attempt at reclaiming ideological space, and the commander of this political venture in revanchism is former SNP MSP, Andrew Wilson.It is hard to separate Wilson the author of the Growth Commission from Wilson the PR man at Charlotte Street Partners, whose company’s clients include the fracking firm, Cluff Natural Resources. In the SNP, as in our politics more generally, we see a contest between the dying ways of the old world and the attempt to create a new world.            We are familiar, whether we know it or not, with the way in which neo-liberalism weaves its story: things that are opinions become truth things that are possible become impossible choices are constrained before the debate has even begun. As Noam Chomsky outlined in The Common Good: “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” It is telling, therefore, that Wilson’s attempt to recapture the ideological direction of the independence movement has not been accepted as an unproblematic truth but has been cast into the public realm for debate.The first victory for the radical independence movement has been to deny this report the veneer of being uncontested. That Nicola Sturgeon was unable to accept the report but had to insist that it was “starting a debate” shows how far politics has come since the White Paper in 2014.             READ MORE: Growth Commission is ‘second biggest mistakes of Nicola Sturgeon’s career’It is important that we recognise and claim this victory and use it to start building our own project for an independent Scotland that creates a new world of genuine equality and social justice, and in which we deal with the urgent economic and environmental crises.Predicting what will happen in politics is a mug’s game. But, there is the strong likelihood that there will be an independence referendum soon. We need to take Nicola Sturgeon at her word: the Wilson report must start a debate. The approach we took in the first referendum since devolution charts a course for this. Ideas like Universal Basic Income, the creation of an industrial strategy to create a zero-carbon economy, and the case for a Scottish currency have become widely accepted in the popular imagination. We need to build on these and develop new ideas to shape the debate and make the case for an independent socialist Scotland.            Our focus must be on ways to harness Scotland’s renewable energy industry for social good, and to democratise the economy. The Scottish National Investment Bank should capitalise renewables projects for all public bodies. We should give workers the right to buy their own businesses to be run as cooperatives. We must build new housing to end the housing crisis to be owned through councils and cooperatives. We must find ways to create a publicly owned, zero-carbon public transport system that makes the most of the shift to electric vehicles and automation. And, we must have a debate that brings these ideas and others into the public imagination. I was proud of the role Green ‘Yes’ forces played in helping to create this debate in the referendum four years ago. And I will ensure that it does the same thing in the next referendum.• Maggie Chapman is co-convener of the Scottish Green Party and rector of Aberdeen University.

As the economic, political and cultural power of China grows, the prominence of Chinese is also growing.                 Many cities, including Edinburgh, are training guides and providing signage in Chinese in order to be ‘China ready’. British business is also starting to realise that being ready to trade overseas will in future mean being ready to speak Chinese to China.            But, given the average Brit’s unwillingness to learn any foreign language, it is perhaps unsurprising that there are few confident non-heritage Chinese speakers in Britain and opportunities to learn Chinese in school are limited.             In Scotland, students were first able to sit Chinese exams in 2009, yet in 2017 only 144 did so. We must do better than that.In Edinburgh, we are doing our bit. In partnership between my school and two state schools and with generous funding from the Swire Chinese Language Foundation, we’ve established the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh (SCLCE) to extend opportunities for pupils to study Mandarin Chinese from primary school to Higher exams.\u2028READ MORE: Boom in Scotland’s Chinese tourism market revealed by Nicola Sturgeon in BeijingIn the past, too many Chinese learning schemes have struggled on account of a lack of long-term commitment. You can’t expect pupils to commit to learning Chinese unless their school can guarantee that they will be able to take at least a Higher in Chinese and that their path through to the examinations will be well resourced and supported by high-quality teachers. That is exactly what the Swire Centre does – and it also provides a rigorous system of leadership and quality-assurance, something that can be difficult to achieve where Chinese teachers are working in isolation and often in part-time roles. In all, the SCLCE can call on five Scottish trained and fully registered teachers and at any one time at least three of those will be teaching in state schools in Edinburgh. In the last academic session, more than 600 pupils across 12 different state schools have benefited from this approach.We’re proud that our latest recruit to SCLCE, Brooke Walker, was recognised by the General Teaching Council for Scotland last month as one of their National Probationers of the Year. Brooke is employed by George Watson’s College but she spent her time during her probationary year in five state schools – two primary and three secondary – where her enthusiasm and passion helped to spread opportunities to learn Chinese where they did not previously exist.READ MORE: Study reveals details of first Chinese citizen who became a Scotsman            Amongst those to benefit most have been pupils facing some huge challenges in their lives and who have previously found foreign language learning unrewarding. Chinese is different and pupils engage with it differently, helped by opportunities to experience elements of Chinese literature, music, dance and cuisine. And soon a fully-funded visit to Beijing that Brooke is helping to lead will expand pupils’ horizons in new and exciting ways.Whatever the future holds it is difficult to imagine that China will not have an influential voice in shaping it. We must do all we can to understand that voice and, what is more, to grasp this opportunity to place a non-European culture at the centre of young people’s educational experience for the first time in our educational history. There’s no excuse for our schools not to be “China ready”.Melvyn Roffe is principal of George Watson’s College, one of the three schools to establish a collaboration to secure funding and set up The Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766842.1531290621!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon boris may just have paved way for softest brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis make the least-damaging form of Brexit more likely, writes First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.                The twin resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson are the first time in more than 35 years that two UK Cabinet ministers have walked out within the same 24 hours. The last time it happened, the UK was grappling with the Falklands crisis.            That fact alone is a measure of how serious the situation facing the Prime Minister now is.            But the truth is, Monday’s events were always on the cards – it was just a question of when, and which of the Brexiteers would finally break ranks.That it happened within not much more than 48 hours of the Chequers summit, which was finally supposed to have brought unity to a warring cabinet, shows how perilous the position is for Theresa May.Before examining what this means for Brexit, it is worth recounting the fact that we are now more than two years on from the referendum result, but the UK Government has still not published the white paper outlining what it actually wants in leaving the EU. That will finally emerge later this week, unless more unforeseen events delay it further still.But that two-year delay in spelling out any kind of coherent position is simply inexcusable. The truth is that Brexit has always been more about the internal politics of the Tory party than it has been about the national interest.First of all, it was about the Conservatives’ attempt to see off the supposed threat from UKIP, and then, since the referendum, it has been about the ongoing battle of ideological purity within Tory ranks, as many of their MPs have sought to outbid each other in who can call for the most extreme Brexit possible.            READ MORE: Second Brexit vote in 2019 possible, says article 50 authorThe last two years have been, in some ways, the culmination, or at least the latest and perhaps defining chapter, of a 40-year civil war within the Conservative party.But that internal obsession, in putting party interest ahead of the national interest, is a simply unforgiveable abdication of responsibility for any government.The irony is that, for all the talk of Brexit being betrayed, the UK Government is still determined to take the UK as a whole out of the EU, the single market and the customs union. Scotland, of course, voted for none of these things.            I believe the Chequers plan is a step forward in that it appears to offer more realism than we have heard from the UK Government to date, although that may not be saying much. And, of course, we still do not know whether or not as a package it would be acceptable to the EU, in that it still appears to be cherry picking, trying to divide the four freedoms which are the cornerstones of the single market.It is also horrendously complicated and, of course, it excludes provision for services, which account for almost 80 per cent of the Scottish economy, and a similar proportion of the UK economy as a whole. Around a third of our exports are services exports, so while the plan is a step forward from where Theresa May and her Cabinet were a couple of weeks ago, it is nowhere near good enough to protect all our vital economic interests. An extreme Brexit, of the kind threatened by the Tories, also poses a direct threat to Scotland’s long-term economic well-being for many decades to come in the shape of the risk it poses to our working-age population.That threat is one that hangs over the whole of the UK, but the differing demographics of Scotland mean that it is more true of the Scottish economy. Immigration is a subject that may be difficult for politicians to talk about, but it is one that we have a duty to be honest with people about, because the simple fact is that we need to continue to attract the best and the brightest talent from elsewhere. That is an economic imperative for Scotland, but is something that is directly threatened by Brexit.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit ‘would clear Scottish supermarkets of food in two days’            Some commentators have speculated that the events of recent days have raised the prospects of a no-deal Brexit, whereby the UK crashes out of the EU next March with no agreement at all to take its place.However, looking at the arithmetic in the House of Commons, I do not believe there is a parliamentary majority for a no-deal outcome. And I also think that after the Davis and Johnson resignations it is highly questionable whether there is a majority for the Chequers plan as it stands.In my view, the only thing that actually stands a realistic chance of commanding a majority in the House of Commons, as well as being the right thing for the interests of the economy, is continued membership of the single market and customs union. I have been consistent in saying that I do not want to leave the EU, in line with what people in Scotland voted for, but if the UK is to leave then the least worst outcome is one that keeps us in a single market which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.That is supported by practically all mainstream economic analysis. And it is significant that in recent days we have started to see more and more businesses speak out about the very real threat which Brexit poses to jobs, investment and living standards right across the UK.There is now a chance, I believe, that the events of this week will help pave the way for the least damaging Brexit. That was not the intention of David Davis or Boris Johnson in resigning, but it may yet be their legacy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767296.1531315064!/image/image.jpg","title":"big ben to be redecorated with cross of st george","story":"                As part of a major restoration project, workers will return decorative elements around the clock face of the Elizabeth Tower to their original Victorian colour scheme, including a row of shields bearing the red and white cross on the English flag.window.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {            Palace authorities said the other nations of the UK are represented in floral emblems elsewhere on the clock face, depicting the rose, thistle, shamrock and leek.

He said: “This is the starting point for a relationship between the two nations we want to continue in the future, two nations with a same goal - gaining independence for our countries.“I think there is a long way to work together.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent.

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nThursday 12 Jul 2018 12:38

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
