Outgoing North America editor Sopel is thought to have nearly doubled his BBC pay of up to £234,999.Newsnight presenter Maitlis is believed to have got a pay rise from her salary band of up to £329,999.

Photograph: iStockI secured a permanent position in a fee-charging secondary school as a home economics and Irish teacher a year ago. I was shocked when my bank questioned the security of my salary during a recent mortgage application. How can this be?There has been recent debate over the future of fee-charging schools. Sinn Féin, for example, has proposed withdrawing State funding for the sector. As a result, some private schools have privately warned that they may not survive in the long term. This may be where your bank manager is coming from.You’ll be aware that some teaching staff in fee-charging schools are privately employed, but most are paid by the Department of Education. I presume, from your query, that you are in the latter category.Why is the department paying teachers in private schools? You need to go back to the establishment of the “free education\u0026nbspscheme in 1966 by Donagh O’Malley for an answer. At the time all second-level schools outside the old vocational or VEC network were fee-charging.What O’ Malley offered all secondary schools – predominantly owned and managed by religious orders – was a £25 capitation payment per student annually, on the basis that they would declare that they were no longer charging fees.The majority of schools signed up to the scheme, pocketed the £25 from the State, subtracted the amount from their existing annual fee and reclassified the balance as a “voluntary contribution”.A proportion of schools whose fees were substantially higher than £25 on offer or who were servicing Ireland’s minority faith communities decided to remain as they were pre-1966. In other words, they continued to charge fees and opted not to avail of the annual capitation payment. You are currently employed in one of these schools.Nobody in 1966 questioned the validity of these schools continuing as they were or whether the State would continue to pay their teachers salaries. This, however, is now a subject of debate.Today, teachers are allocated at a ratio of one for every 19 students in “free” secondary schools, compared with one for every 23 students in the fee-charging sector. The policy was first introduced as a cost-cutting measure in 2009.A spokesman for the Department of Education said what differentiates fee-charging schools from others is their capacity to raise funds through mandatory fees, while also being in receipt of exchequer funding.Teachers in private schools who are paid by the department have a secure salary in the event of closure, for example, you would be entitled to be redeployed, though it is doubtful whether you would be entitled to hold on to any middle-management posts or allowances. Privately-employed teachers, however, would not have this security."},{"url":null,"title":"covid cases could double in coming weeks immunologist says","story":"HSE chief clinical officer Colm Henry has urged people to continue to wear face coverings on public transport. Photograph: iStockCases of Covid-19 in the State could double again before this current wave begins to plateau, a professor of immunology has said.By 8am on Tuesday, there were 1,605 confirmed cases of the virus in Irish hospitals. Over the previous 24 hours, 198 Covid patients were admitted, while 130 were discharged.Tuesday’s figure is a slight decrease on Monday when 1,624 patients were in hospital.However, this is typical of a trend where figures tend to be higher on Mondays due to delayed discharges over the weekend.Christine Loscher, professor of immunology at DCU, said last night cases are high at the moment because of the dominance of the highly-transmissible Omicron sub-variant BA.2, which now accounts for almost 95 per cent of cases here. “The levels in the community are really high. The risk of catching Covid at the moment has never been as high,” she told Virgin Media’s Tonight Show.These case numbers will continue to increase over the coming weeks, she added.“I think we’ll see a doubling again before it starts to plateau and starts to drop,” she said.“This surge will pass but at the moment the risk of Covid in the community is very high and the WHO advice is always that we should do every single thing we can to reduce transmission. “I feel like we’re doing a lot but we’re not doing everything. Mask-wearing, I think, is really key at the moment.”Although the sub-variant is not believed to be more dangerous than its predecessor, there is a clear translation to hospitalisations in recent weeks, she said.“That’s a concern because the healthcare system serves more than just Covid patients.”Prof Loscher’s comments come as the health service warned of the pressure it is under as a result of the rising number of patients with Covid.The unvaccinated were still disproportionate in terms of hospitalisation and half of those in critical care had not received their booster vaccine, he said. He said 6,000 healthcare staff were absent from work because of the virus.Thanks to the vaccination programme, the symptoms experienced by the majority of those infected were less severe, but the number of cases was still impacting the flow of patients through hospitals and their discharge to care settings. Hospitals were experiencing “considerable disruption”, he said, adding that the current level of cases was leading to the cancellation of scheduled procedures and was also having an impact on community care.Dr Henry said while it was up to the Government to make a decision on reintroducing mandatory mask wearing, he called on people to wear masks in public settings. There needed to be greater compliance about the wearing of masks. “The pandemic has not gone away”, he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland likely experiencing several hundred thousand covid 19 cases per week says donnelly","story":"Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly: ‘Extremely restrictive’ measures would be needed to contain highly transmissible BA.2 subvariant. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital could top 2,200 within the next 10 days, Ministers believe, amid increasing pressure on the Government to re-examine restrictions.The Coalition is reluctant to reimpose any measures and currently intends to allow emergency Covid-19 public health laws lapse on Thursday.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the extra transmissibility of the BA.2 subvariant means “quite extreme measures” would be needed to contain it.He told an online meeting of Fianna Fáil members on Monday night that there were likely several hundred thousand cases of Covid every week, with daily numbers several times higher than those being tracked by PCR and antigen tests.However, a stakeholders’ taskforce has written to Mr Donnelly seeking fresh public advice amid concern about rising case numbers.The Emergency Department (ED) Taskforce, which monitors overcrowding in hospitals, urged Mr Donnelly to convene “the necessary public health resources and advisors to consider any and all measures that may now be appropriate in order to provide an increased level of protection to health and social care service provision”.ModellingUpdated Covid-19 modelling has been sought by Government, but a senior source said that, based on an analysis of recent data, there could be a peak of 2,000-2,200 Covid-19 hospitalisations in the next seven to 10 days, and the figure would then “fall fast”.The ED Taskforce, which is co-chaired by the HSE’s chief operating officer, Anne O’Connor, and the general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, Phil Ní Sheaghdha, met on Monday.There were 1,624 people in hospital with coronavirus on Monday, of whom 54 were in intensive care units.Mr Donnelly said the transmissibility of the BA.2 subvariant meant that extremely restrictive measures would be needed to contain it, and said that he was told by chief medical officer Tony Holohan that extra restrictions of this level were not currently advised.Sources said he told the Fianna Fáil meeting that about half the 54 people in critical care units who had Covid were there because of the virus, and that about the same number were not fully vaccinated.On masks, he told the meeting that while the legal requirement to wear masks had been disposed of, the public health advice to do so had been retained.‘Well into April’HSE chief Paul Reid said on Monday the experience of other countries in Europe was that the current variant waned after a while, so that meant Ireland was likely to be dealing with the current wave of the virus “well into April”.He was speaking as the Department of Health announced that 39,561 cases of Covid-19 had been recorded in the last three days.While hospitals are dealing with the most severe effects from the latest Covid wave, it has had a knock-on effect on other sectors including aviation, with Dublin Airport experiencing long delays due to staff shortages.Its operator, DAA, said it had set up a taskforce to consider emergency measures including the possible opening of security desks on a 24-hour basis and speeding up the placement of new recruits.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"auto enrolment pension for private sector workers to cost 3bn over 10 years","story":"Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said the new scheme will begin auto-enrolling people in January 2024. Photograph: Collins The Government’s new auto-enrolement pension scheme will cost the State almost €3 billion in the first decade of its operation, the minister for social protection has said. Contributions to the scheme from workers and employers, initially at a level of 1.5 per cent of an employee’s salary each, will be supplemented by a Government contribution. All told, between employer and Government contributions, €4 will be paid into the scheme for every €3 a worker pays in. Around 750,000 private sector workers over the age of 23, and under the age of 60, who earn more than €20,000 per year will be automatically enrolled in the pension schemeHeather Humphreys said the scheme was a “long time coming” and some form of a programme to supplement the state pension had been discussed for two decades. “This represents a significant milestone in implementing one of our key programme for Government commitments,” she said. “Every worker will have access to a workplace pension,” she said, saying it would change a system whereby workers were “often left to their own devices to navigate what is a complex world of pensions to one in which choices and options are simplified on their behalf.”The scheme will begin auto-enrolling people in January 2024, Ms Humphreys said, with heads of bill to be drafted and approved by the Government before the end of this year, with the legislation to be enacted by the third quarter of 2023. Contributions will increase on an annual basis across the first ten years of the scheme - climbing from 1.5 per cent for the employer and the worker in the first three years, to three per cent in years 4-6, 4.5 per cent in the following three years, and coming in at six per cent in year ten. The cost of the scheme to the State across this period will be €3 billion, and the State contribution will only be paid on incomes up to €80,000 - although those earning over this amount can still participate. There will be limited capacity for those who paying into the scheme to draw down early from the scheme, a briefing was told today - with only illness being considered as grounds to do so. Ms Humpreys said future retirees are facing a drop in their standard of living - while people were living longer, but also forming higher expectations about life after retirement. “The best time to start saving for a pension is now,” she said. While those who have been auto-enrolled can opt-out after six months and cash out their own contributions, they will be re-enrolled after another two years. The window to opt out will be during the seventh and eighth month of membership. This option will only exist in the first ten years, and while members will be able to suspend payments after that, they won’t be given their contributions back - instead, they will remain in the pot. The state will set up a Central Processing Authority (CPA) which will administer the scheme. The pensions themselves will be invested by four registered providers, and there will also be four different investment portfolios available for those paying into the scheme, depending on their risk appetite. There will be an online portal where members will be able to review the size of their pension pot. Payments will be made into a default fund, unless payers specify otherwise. Those outside the eligibility criteria - for example, who earn too little, or are not old enough or are too old for auto enrolment - will be able to opt in and take part in the scheme if they so wish. By the end of the first decade of operation, the Department of Social protection estimates that there will be around €21 billion in funds under management. The scheme has a “maximum envisaged” annual management charge equivalent to 0.5 per cent of assets under management. A single pension pot will transfer along with a worker, if they switch jobs, so employees will not have to move their pension across to a new scheme. Meanwhile, employers will be required to record information about pension payments via payroll - but will not be asked to carry out any assessments of eligibility. The contributions will be deductible for the purposes of corporation tax. Firms who fail to implement a payroll instruction for enrolment, or to deduct and remit contributions will face administrative penalties initially, and ultimately risk prosecution as a criminal offence. Ms Humphreys indicated that the state retirement age - which the Government had previously indicated would be decided by the end of this month - will be decided on during April, following a Government decision.

I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal.’  Photograph: James ManningPA Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis has played down the prospect of triggering article 16 and acknowledged Britain is legally obliged to carry out checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. He told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster the checks demanded by the Northern Ireland protocol are “legal requirements” and it was right they were continuing despite threats by DUP Ministers to halt them. “Of course, even taking those away doesn’t necessarily in and of itself even solve some of the issues that businesses are having,” he said. He said the reason Britain did not trigger article 16 was because the government was committed to reaching an agreement with the European Commission, adding that “Article 16 doesn’t scrap the protocol.” Mr Lewis is not directly involved in the protocol negotiations which are led by foreign secretary Liz Truss and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic. He said he believed Mr Sefcovic was eager to reach a deal but that he was hamstrung by negotiating red lines set out by EU leaders. “I think he is someone who is pragmatic, he would like to try to find a way through this. But he is trying to work within a mandate and I think there is a real issue that the mandate from his point of view may not give him the flexibility to find a way through this so far,” he said. ‘Pragmatism and flexibility’“I have not seen the sort of flexibility from the EU that I would have expected to see. I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal. Otherwise we would have agreed one by now.” Describing the protocol as unsustainable, Mr Lewis said it was not working for business and 200 companies in Great Britain were no longer shipping goods to Northern Ireland. The committee’s chairman, Simon Hoare, pointed out that trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland had increased since the protocol came into force. Mr Lewis defended his government’s decision to renege on the protocol it had itself negotiated, which he said was undermining the Belfast Agreement. Trade declineIn a separate committee hearing at Westminster on Monday, chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak admitted Brexit was causing problems for British businesses which trade with Europe. The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent fiscal watchdog, said last week that trade as a share of the economy had fallen in Britain by 2½ times more than any other major industrialised country. “It was always inevitable that there would be a change in our trade intensity with Europe as a result of the change in trading relationship,” Mr Sunak said. “Without a doubt we are changing out trading relationship with the EU and that means a different set of controls and things that people will have to do. Obviously that will have an impact and I’m sure that’s a big part of the reason this is happening. It may just be a bit early to be definitive about which bits are doing what.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Video: Reuters Turkish President Erdogan  addressing the Russian (L) and Ukrainian (R) delegations before their talks at Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul, Turkey. Photograph: EPARussia has decided to “dramatically” scale back its military activities in the Kyiv area, a top defence ministry official said following a fresh round of peace talks with Ukrainian counterparts in Istanbul.Alexander Fomin, Russia’s deputy defence minister, said the move was intended to “increase mutual trust” as he announced it in Turkey after face-to-face talks concluded on Tuesday.In order to “create the necessary conditions for future negotiations”, Russia’s defence ministry had decided to “dramatically reduce military activities in the directions of Kyiv and Chernihiv”, Fomin said in a video shared by Russian state media.The decision had been taken as “negotiations over the preparation of an agreement on Ukraine’s neutrality and non-nuclear status, as well as on the provision of security guarantees for Ukraine, are entering a practical stage”, he said.More details would be released after the Russian delegation returned to Moscow, Fomin said. He also called on Ukraine to follow Geneva Conventions on the humane treatment of prisoners of war.Talks concludedThe talks in Istanbul concluded on Tuesday afternoon in an Ottoman-era palace on the shore of the Bosphorus. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants the talks to pave the way for Ukraine’s and Russia’s leaders to meet.Among those present was Roman Abramovich, the Russian owner of Chelsea Football Club who suffered poisoning symptoms when attempting to broker talks in Kyiv earlier this month.While negotiators had sketched the outlines of a potential ceasefire and moves towards a political settlement, diplomats in Kyiv, Moscow and the west said they remained sceptical about any imminent breakthrough.The Russian military announcement follows statements made last week by the leadership of the Russian armed forces announcing Moscow was entering a “new phase” in the war in Ukraine.Members of the general staff of the Russian armed forces said on Friday that Russia would now be focusing on battles in the east of the country, where it has been expanding the territories under the control of its troops together with the forces of the Luhansk and Donetsk breakaway republics, and fighting for dominance in the south-eastern city of Mariupol.Push backBefore the talks began on Tuesday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, used a late-night address to praise his forces for retaking Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv and an important gateway to the capital, the latest in a series of counter-attacks that pushed back Russian forces.“The occupiers are pushed away from Irpin. Pushed away from Kyiv,” said Zelenskiy. “However, it is too early to talk about security in this part of our region. The fighting continues. Russian troops control the north of Kyiv, have the resources and manpower.”Ukraine’s precise gains have not been independently verified but the UK said Zelenskiy’s forces had made progress in “localised counter-attacks” to the north-west of Kyiv, including at Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel. “These attacks have had some success and the Russians have been pushed back from a number of positions,” said the Ministry of Defence in an intelligence update on Tuesday.If confirmed, the recapture of Irpin would mark a significant moment for Ukraine’s forces. The suburb of Kyiv has been the scene of heavy fighting since the war began.Humanitarian corridorsMoscow and Kyiv are discussing a pause in hostilities and humanitarian corridors as part of a possible deal that would involve Ukraine abandoning its drive for Nato membership in exchange for security guarantees and the prospect of joining the EU, according to people familiar with the talks.With Russia’s month-long ground offensive largely stalled, Moscow has signalled its willingness to pull back from some of its most difficult initial demands. But Ukraine and its western backers fear Russian president Vladimir Putin may be using the talks as a ruse to resupply his forces in preparation for a fresh offensive.Draft ceasefire documents do not include reference to “denazification”, “demilitarisation” and legal protection for the Russian language in Ukraine, according to four people briefed on the discussions. Moscow is also prepared to let Kyiv join the EU if it remains militarily non-aligned, the people said.David Arakhamia, head of Zelenskiy’s party in parliament and a member of Kyiv’s negotiating team, told the Financial Times before the talks that the parties were close to agreement on the security guarantees and Ukraine’s EU bid but urged caution about prospects for a breakthrough, saying that many points were “unresolved”.Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said the country’s negotiators would “not trade people, land and sovereignty” during talks.Territorial gainsWith the war in its second month, Russia has increasingly concentrated on making advances in the east, aiming to envelop Ukrainian forces there while throwing troops into the grinding battle for the port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov.In addition to the counter-attacks around Kyiv, Ukraine claimed battlefield momentum in the Sumy region north-west of its second city Kharkiv, and near the city of Izyum in the east, saying it had retaken the settlements of Kamyanka and Topolske. Ukrainian forces are also making advances in the southern Kherson region.Most of the territorial gains are limited in scale and cannot be independently verified. But the Pentagon on Monday confirmed that Ukrainian forces had recaptured the town of Trostyanets, north-west of Kharkiv.Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Tuesday that Kyiv “still remains one of the main goals of this war for Putin”.In an update on operations on Tuesday, Ukraine’s military claimed Russia’s troops were “weakened” and “disoriented”, with some units cut off from supply lines and the main forces. It said Russia was resorting to “indiscriminate artillery fire and rocket-bomb attacks” to offset the “decline in the combat potential of enemy units”.On Tuesday morning, a Russian rocket wrecked the building of the Mykolayiv regional administration, said governor Vitaliy Kim.According to a UK intelligence briefing, the Wagner Group, the private Russian military organisation whose mercenaries have fought in Ukraine and Syria and are established in Mali and the Central African Republic, had been “deployed to eastern Ukraine” and was expected to send more than 1,000 fighters.“Due to heavy losses and a largely stalled invasion, Russia has likely been forced to reprioritise Wagner personnel for Ukraine at the expense of operations in Africa and Syria,” it said. – Copyright The Financial Times

flushing lavatory open visitors first time four centuries","story":"Visitors to York will be able to see Henry III’s unique “flushing” lavatory for the first time in four centuries after a landmark restoration of Clifford’s Tower.The 800-year-old keep, perched on top of a Norman motte or mound, is the largest surviving element of York castle.Its interior burnt down in the 17th century and the tower has remained a ruin ever since.However, as part of a landmark £5 million conservation project, English Heritage has installed a timber platform within the castle, beneath which hang metal walkways.This has created a large roof deck on which visitors can stand and access to Henry III’s garderobe for the first time since the fire in 1684.The existing tower would have originally been built “as a place of elegance and sophistication… a royal chamber for the luxury-loving Henry III,” said Jeremy Ashbee, the head properties curator at English Heritage.Among those luxuries was the flushing lavatory, now accessible to visitors.It consists of a traditional medieval garderobe, where the lavatory hangs open over the edge of the castle wall, but also includes a carved stone channel for water to flow into the bowl. It is the only known example in England.Opposite the garderobe is the niche for a toiletries cupboard that would have contained the king’s private articles.Henry III reigned from 1216 to 1272, more than 300 years before the first written description of a flushing lavatory and 500 years before Alexander Cumming was granted the first patent for a flush toilet.The precise mechanisms of the flush remain unknown. It may have involved some kind of automated mechanism or it could have been as simple as a servant on the roof above the lavatory tipping over a bucket. Water would have been collected manually from the well within the tower walls and carried to the castle roof.The conservation project, one of English Heritage’s largest since a new bridge was installed at Tintagel in Cornwall, is part of what Mr Ashbee dubbed a trend toward “sensitive contemporary conservation”.“This is quite a conservative repair,” he told The .The architects and English Heritage were insistent that the ruination of the tower not be altered, hence the large hole in the centre of the deck that ensures the interior remains open to the elements.It also led to the selection of clearly modern materials, including glue-laminated timber, steel and LED lighting.Hugh Broughton, who designed the timber deck, said it was about “not trying to pretend that it\u0027s something that it isn\u0027t” by disguising the modern work as medieval.The deck, which balances on four immense wooden columns, does not exert any structural load on the tower walls.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin will \u0026#39drastically reduce hostilities\u0026#39 near Kyiv to \u0026#39de-escalate\u0026#39 warMax Mosley died from \u0026#39gunshot wound\u0026#39 after terminal cancer diagnosisPolitics latest news: Police have not told Boris Johnson he will beSadness in the Queen\u0026#39s eyes and a sobbing Beatrice as Royal family\u0026#39s stiff upper lip slips for Prince PhilipWatch: Ukrainian forces take back Trostyanets after Russians left town in ruinsBoris Johnson may never escape the shadow of PartygateMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"post covid education policy requires ambition","story":"Given the impact of the pandemic on our children’s schooling, a new plan for education is an important policy document. A white paper published yesterday contains a set of ambitions that can hardly be considered contentious. It wants “strong schools with great teachers” and “standards that will improve children’s education, deliver the right support if they fall behind and give them the tools to lead a happy, fulfilled and successful life”.It is hard to imagine any strategy that would not cleave to such aspirations. The issue, as it always has been, is how to make them a reality.The vehicle for meeting them is an expansion of so-called multi-academy trusts (Mats), with all English schools expected to be in one or have plans to join or form one within eight years. Each trust will have about 10 schools and 7,500 pupils and there will be protections for selective schools, though no removal of the ban on new grammar schools.One point about academies was to remove schools from local authority control and yet councils will be able to set up their own Mats. Areas of the country where the main barrier to improvement has been the council are unlikely to benefit.The white paper envisages schools providing a minimum of 32.5 hours of schooling a week (inevitably opposed by the unions) when arguably it should be longer to help the Covid generation catch up. There is much in the strategy to show parents the Government is intent on pushing up standards. Whether it is ambitious enough to repair the damage caused by the pandemic lockdowns is another matter.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin will \u0026#39drastically reduce hostilities\u0026#39 near Kyiv to \u0026#39de-escalate\u0026#39 warMax Mosley died from \u0026#39gunshot wound\u0026#39 after terminal cancer diagnosisPolitics latest news: Police have not told Boris Johnson he will beSadness in the Queen\u0026#39s eyes and a sobbing Beatrice as Royal family\u0026#39s stiff upper lip slips for Prince PhilipWatch: Ukrainian forces take back Trostyanets after Russians left town in ruinsBoris Johnson may never escape the shadow of PartygateMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"service duke edinburgh confirms need royals","story":"More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin will \u0026#39drastically reduce hostilities\u0026#39 near Kyiv to \u0026#39de-escalate\u0026#39 warMax Mosley died from \u0026#39gunshot wound\u0026#39 after terminal cancer diagnosisPolitics latest news: Police have not told Boris Johnson he will beSadness in the Queen\u0026#39s eyes and a sobbing Beatrice as Royal family\u0026#39s stiff upper lip slips for Prince PhilipWatch: Ukrainian forces take back Trostyanets after Russians left town in ruinsBoris Johnson may never escape the shadow of PartygateMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"five star hotel justifies charging","story":"Five-star hotel justies charging more than £. for scone after backlashAny debates about jam or cream first were sidelined after a customer posted a picture of a € receipt for tea and scones for three people, along with the caption send an ambulanceCashel Palace has recently opened Image: cashelpalaceByCormac OSheaMarita MoloneyDigital ReporterKit Roberts:,  Mar |comments A five-star hotel has hit back after a customer took to Twitter to complain about the high price of a scone.The customer posted a picture of their receipt from a trip to hotel, which showed the cost of three rounds of tea and scones for themselves and their companions.

This is what keeps me awake at night. But he was accused of failing to get the basics right with the new plans, which critics said lacked ambition - and funding - to deliver for children. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said parents would be surprised to hear that a focus on helping every child develop good reading, writing and maths skills is a new discovery for the Education Secretary.  Ministers have also been accused of failing to address the educational disadvantage gap between rich and poor students - which has been heightened by repeated Covid lockdowns. Government-commissioned research from the Education Policy Institute, published today, found secondary pupils fell further behind over the autumn school term, with some now . months behind their expected reading level. Primary pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were . months behind their wealthier peers in reading, while the gap rose to . months for secondary pupils. Hereaposs what you need to know. Longer school weeksSchools will be told to offer at least . hours per week by September  - the equivalent of .am to .pm each day.Teachers are able to decide how the day is structured, so this could be extra time for English and Maths or sport and art activities. Mr Zahawi said he wanted to address the discrepancy of time spent in school, adding: It is unfair that a child who receives  minutes per day less of teaching time loses out on around  weeks of schooling a year.  The white paper says schools will be encouraged to go beyond the .-hour targetpossible. They will also be told to publish their hours online. But ministers were accused of missing the point by setting a target that most schools hit anyway. Former catch-up tsar Kevan Collins estimated around , schools were below the .-hour mark. There will also be no extra funding for schools to cover the longer hours. It wonapost apply to specialist schools and it is not a statutory requirement. Parents told when children falling behind The white paper includes Parent Pledge to provide extra support for pupils falling behind in class on reading, writing and maths. Parents will be told when their children need help to catch up and extra support will be given to these kids through tutoring.  But Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, descried the idea as a gimmick and said schools already had systems to help pupils. The union boss warned the idea might create expectations of on-demand support which would be dficult for schools to meet. Parents are usually already told how their children are doing through parents evenings and other channels. Boosting targets for Maths and English Higher targets for English and Maths will be introduced as part of efforts to boost standards following the pandemic. By , % of children leaving primary school to reach the expected standard in reading, writing and maths – up from the % who did in . At GCSE level, the government wants the national mean average of all grades to rise from . to  - a strong pass between the former B and C grades.  But critics have said the plan had little detail on how this would be achieved - and warned the document failed to provide a plan to close the growing disadvantage gap. NEU chief Dr Mary Bousted said: Expecting % of -year-olds to meet an arbitrary ‘expected standard’ in Maths and English at Key Stage  without giving any indication of the support that will be needed to achieve this target will immediately raise the temperature in the educational hothouse that schools have become. All schools to be inspected by Ofsted by  All schools will be inspected before pupils head off for their summer holidays in , the Government has said. Schools watchdog Ofsted had received £million to speed up its school visits so education chiefs can understand how well schools are recovering from the pandemic. Outstanding schools will be inspected for the first time this term. They were previously exempt.  Mr Zahawi believes the inspects will give parents an “up-to-date picture” and swter recognition of the hard work of leaders and teachers. The proportion of schools rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted has increased by  percentage points, from % in  to % in  Councils can set up academy trusts Plans are being redrawn to allow councils to establish their own academy trusts and ask their schools to join them by .

Academies are state-funded schools but they are independent from local authorities, which gives them power over their curriculum, resources and governance.

New national register to stop pupils falling through the cracks The Government aims to change how pupil attendance is recorded after concerns over “ghost children” who failed to come back to class after lockdowns. Some experts estimate that as many as , pupils who have gone missing from school rolls during the pandemic.New laws would be introduced to modernise how attendance is recorded, with a national data solution used to track attendance and provide a safety net for vulnerable pupils at risk of disappearing from school rolls.Last year, former Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield said between , and , kids did notto school last September. “These are kids whowe don’t get them back to school will have diminished le chances and job opportunities,” she said.

Labour will force a binding vote on the release of information given to Boris Johnson before Lord Lebedev was made a peer, following reports the Prime Minister overruled concerns raised by MI and MI. Using a parliamentary mechanism called a Humble Address, Angela Rayner will call on Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay to make public the details concerning the appointment. The Cabinet Office plays a central role in the vetting process of Lords.Lord Lebedev, who owns both the London Evening Standard and the Independent, got his wealth from his Russian oligarch father Alexander Lebedev, a former KGB security officer. The crossbench peer is known to be close to the Prime Minister, having previously hosted him at a party at his Italian mansion in , when Mr Johnson was Foreign Secretary.Labouraposs Deputy Leader said the government has questions to answer over the appointment and transparency was now an important matter of national security amid Vladimir Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine.She said: The Prime Minister has allowed his friendship with the son and business partner of an ex-KGB agent to blind his primary duty to the British public – to keep them safe.  The Prime Minister has once again put personal interest before the publicaposs, and this time heaposs risked national security. “The British public have a right to knowand how an inidual of apparent concern to our intelligence services was granted a seat in the heart of our Parliament by Boris Johnson, against security advice. “This Government’s dangerous links to Putin’s oligarchs are putting Britain at risk.”The Prime Minister’s former aide, Dominic Cummings, said he was in the room when Mr Johnson was told by Cabinet Office officials that the “intelligence services and other parts of the deep state” had “serious reservations” about the PM’s plan to appoint Lord Lebedev.Deputy Prime Minister, however, has previously said it is “sheer nonsense” to suggest that Boris Johnson had asked anyone in the security services to revise, reconsider or withdraw their assessment of the media mogul. Mr Raab said all iniduals nominated for a peerage are done so in recognition of what their contribution is to society. “And, I should say, that includes those of Russian origin who contribute brilliantly to our nation, many of whom in this country are critics of the Putin regime, he said, when pressed over the matter by Ms Rayner in the Commons.

Skyler, , had been part of a Mormon congregation for more than a decade but decided to begin a new le in  after becoming disillusioned. Mormons live by strict rules including no sex before marriage, no same-sex relationships, no booze, no smoking, no coffee and no gambling.Since leaving the congregation, Skyler, from Calornia, decided it was time to begin exploring her sexuality on her Instagram page @iamskylerx, where she now has nearly , followers.When a follower asked her for more explicit content he was willing to pay for, the model had the idea of setting up her OnlyFans page, which has now been running for two years. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here But her success has come at a price and she claims many people have shut her out since learning about her venture. As a family, we have been shut out, Skyler said. I joined the Mormon church because at the time my husband was part of it, but we left having grown frustrated with the rigidness of the religion and having to give so much of our time and money to it. No vices were allowed. No drinking, no smoking. She added she turned to eating high fat and sugar foods as booze was banned - which caused her to put on weight and had an affect on her sex le. It became a sexless marriage. I stopped looking good for my husband, she said. We also had a tonne of arguments about giving ten per cent of our income to the church.  She claimed the way of le in the Mormon church was delusional and she knew she had to leave. Being a Mormon was taking things away from me as a we and as a mum. It was time to do something for myself, my family and my marriage, Skyler said. As soon as we left, we smoked a big joint and had the best sex we had in years. After setting up her OnlyFans page two years later, Skyler says she was outed to her family - who were still in the church - after a mum of one of her daughteraposs friends found it. Skyler said: She called me up and said my Instagram wasnapost aposappropriateapos. I felt slut-shamed. She then said she wouldnapost be sending her daughter round to our house anymore. It broke my heart seeing a decision I made hurt my daughter so much.  Iaposve also been shunned by other mums when I go and watch my children play softball and once even cried in a hair salon after the hairdresser said she didnapost agree with what I do. My husbandaposs friend of  years also found out – he called up and started yelling down the phone. Weaposve been totally exiled. Skyleraposs husband, who supports her decision to run an OnlyFans page, said it was ridiculous that other mums wonapost let their kids come over. What we get up to as two consenting adults has no effect on the children, he said. There are countless cheating spouses in this town and yet we are the villains. We are honest with our sexual desires and communicate with one another about what we want. Just because their wives arenapost giving them any, blame shouldnapost be placed at our doors. Despite the backlash, Skyler doesnapost regret her choice – and says OnlyFans has done wonders for her marriage. Skyler added: My husband has been my biggest supporter and without him being so encouraging and amazing this wouldn’t have worked out. After being a housewe for so many years I now feel sexy and liberated.

The beast then chomps down on his catch as Samuel tries to wrestle it from the monsteraposs powerful jaws.Eventually, the fish was taken and Samuel left empty-handed – although the thrill of the experience left him more than happy as he shrieked with delight when ing to his boat. It turned out the creature was an Atlantic goliath grouper, one of the largest species of bony fish on the planet.Capable of growing to s of more than  metres, the monster fish have also been known to eat sharks in one gulp. And, unsurprisingly, viewers were absolutely petried by what they witnessed. Nah I would have cut the line man, one wrote. Another commented: Would be so spooked to get the line wrapped around something and get pulled deep. And a third said: Dude you just caught one of the biggest fish ever. Theyaposre known as goliath groupers and their mouths open to x their body meaning they eat sharks.  Itaposs not the first time a clip of a Goliath grouper fish has gone viral. Back in , footage of a great white shark battling the sea monster stunned the internet. And another clip emerged back in  showed a man getting sucked underwater by the fish. Earlier this month, the body of a rare shark born when King Henry VIII was on the throne was found off Britain. The Greenland shark which has the longest known lespan of all vertebrate species between  and  years was spotted by a walker on a beach at Newlyn Harbour near Penzance, Cornwall on Sunday, March . Cornwall Wildle Trustaposs Marine Strandings Network was contacted and arrived at the beach within an hour but the tide had come in and washed the shark back out into the sea. This sparked an urgent appeal to search for the shark. A crew from Mermaid Pleasure Trips found the shark and took it ashore. Marine Strandings Network thanked the crew for their efforts. They said: We are absolutely delighted to update you that the superb crew from Mermaid Pleasure Trips, Penzance, Trev and Kingsley, this evening found and brought ashore the dead Greenland shark which previously stranded on Sunday and then washed back out to sea.

Kilo was found in Huyton, near Liverpool, by Dogs Trust Merseyside after his former family abandoned him near to a busy road having decided they couldnapost cope with him anymore.The brave Staffordshire Bull Terrier was accompanied by his food and water bowls, while a note gave his name and explained his owners could no longer care for him.He is believed to be around six years old, reports the Liverpool Echo. The charityaposs team has been hit hard by the ordeal and are desperate to find Kilo a new forever home. He is slowly building a bond with the likes of carer Chris Furnell who has been temporarily looking after him.  Kilo is not yet ready to play with toys but is becoming accustomed to having a fuss made of him. His carers are confident his true personality will eventually begin to shine throughhe can find a loving new home. Charity manager Georgina Lowery said: “It is so sad and shocking when this happens.  We found him at around pm and we are just so grateful that he hadn’t managed to pull himself free, especially as we are near a busy road. He is a gorgeous boy but understandably a little nervous given what he has been through. As nobody has come forward to claim him he is now ready to find a new home. The fact that Kilo was left with his food bowls and his owners told us his name and left a note, show they cared about him, but we would always urge anyone needing to give up their dog to contact us, however dficult. That way we can find out as much as possible about the dog which helps us find them their ideal home as quickly as possible, and of course it means we can avoid unnecessary suffering and distress to the dog. As no one has turned up to claim Kilo, the team at Dogs Trust are now seeking a new home for the lovable terrier. They seek an adult only home where he is the only dog and with no visiting children. They say that whilst he builds his confidence, he will benefit greatly from patient owners who can afford him the space and time to allow him to settle in and trust again.If youaposre interested and fit the description of the ideal owner, you can find Kilo at www.dogstrust.org.uk Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But one man might have cracked it - just have a very very tiny car. Meet Alex - the man with Britainaposs lowest fuel bill as he drives the worldaposs smallest car - which costs just £ to fill up. Alex Orchin, , can be seen trundling around his Sussex village on his daily chores in his quirky blue Peel P and he said it costs around £ or so to fill up. The car, which has only three wheels, is just cm long, cm wide and cm high and has a five litre petrol tank. And at ft ins, Alex fits comfortably in it too.  His car, a P, was first made on the Isle of Man in the s and in  were named the smallest production car ever built in the book of Guinness World Records. It has a top speed of just mph.Alex is an avid motoring collector and says became obsessed with the cars since watching Jeremy Clarkson drive one on Top Gear.He said: “I have always had an interest in old, vintage and unusual cars since I was a kid. aposaposNo one in my family was into it - it was a bit of a random obsession!  I used to be a chauffer for vintage cars and have had a  Model T and a  Morris Minor too. “I got fixated on this idea of having a P just because it was so tiny but when I saw an original was £, it kind of killed it off. “But about four years ago I bought one of the newer ones from the Isle of Man - so I’m only the second owner. The car always gets attention - it is quite staggering because to me itaposs just a tiny car.apos  Itaposs much smaller than you think it is - everyone says that when they see the car in person. I can fit a shopping bag down the left of the car by the handbrake, but nothing . The vehicle was built in  but is based on the original design from the first production models in the s.  The mini-motor allows Alex comfortable journeys to and from his home in Wivelsfield, Sussex. Last year he drove theof the UK in the car - starting his , mile journey from John OaposGroats on November  and arrived in Landaposs End on December . He was just in time for his three week goal - and raised over £, for Children in Need. Alex said: Iaposve owned a lot of cars and none of them get as much attention as this one. NormallyI pull up in a Morris Minor it is car people and enthusiasts that want to come and talk with me.  aposaposBut my Peel P attracts absolutely everyone, including people who arenapost interested in cars. They think itaposs so hilarious and children love it! The under ten year oldaposs especially go mad for it.aposapos The one-seater car is unable to fit a rucksack or a suitcase inside and forces Alexaposs knees to go on either side of the steering wheel.You can visit Alexaposs Youtube channel aposForward to The Pastapos here.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON YouTubeJeremy ClarksonChildren In NeedTop GearLoveWorld records\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Luke Lal later used dating app, to send abusive messages, one of which said the victimaposs sexuality would be told to his parents. Lal, , of Birmingham, West Midlands, had previously admitted assault and was given  months suspended sentence for  months and ordered to do  hours unpaid work.Michael Shaw, prosecuting, told Birmingham Crown Court the couple had been in a relationship for some time and there had been dficulties, reports BirminghamLive. During the argument Lal repeatedly punched his partner in the head then grabbed hold of his penis, causing a small laceration.  His partner later went to hospital where the injury was treated. A family court issued a non molestation order banning Lal from having contact with the victim. But the defendant later sent texts to him on an unregistered mobile phone and abusive messages after setting up a fake account of Grindr. In a statement the victim said what had happened had affected his mental health, family le and relationships.He said he had received counselling and that the scar reminded him of the trauma. He suffered from flashbacks and anxiety and depression and it had left him fuelled by anger. Sentencing, Judge Paul Farrer QC said that it had been a strained relationship and that the fault lay on both sides.He added: You and the victim argued and you attacked him and punched him to the head repeatedly.  You had your hands around his throat. You also grabbed his penis and pulled it forcibly about five times so it caused a one centimetre wound which was later glued and has left a scar. That the victim has found embarrassing. You sent a relatively large number of messages over a period of about four months. They were abusive and you threatened to reveal his sexuality to his parents, a threat that would have caused him severe distress. He added that the injury had been to a highly sensitive part of your victimaposs body.But he said he had taken into account that the incident happened over two years ago. Simon Cadwaladr, defending, said: This is set against a background of a relationship between two men that started with high hopes but quickly deteriorated.He said it had resulted in criminal proceedings being taken against both men. Mr Cadwaladr said the assault occurred after an argument over something as trivial as to what to have for dinner. Each of them were behaving in an extremely unfortunate manner towards each other in the emotional breakdown of their relationship.

The woman, who wishes to simply be known as Caroline, captured video footage of a vast amount of flies in her neighbouraposs window and shared it on social media. She has hit out at Sovereign Housing - the association responsible for her block of flats in Bristol. Sovereign said in a statement that Carolineaposs neighbour has been confirmed to be safe and well following a welfare check. The company will be visiting the property today with Environmental Health to investigate the cause of the flies.Caroline told Bristol Live she had ed home at am on the morning of March  to find what she describes as hundreds and thousands of huge blue bottle flies inside her neighbours flat window, all trying to get out. She believed she probably hadnapost noticed it sooner because the weather hadnapost been warm or sunny before that day.She added: I knew something was dead in that flat and I have also not seen the owner for two years. I alerted Sovereign but got the standard email reply back that they have two weeks to even read the email. I have been woken at night by these huge horrible big flies in my bedroom lounge upstairs. There are three of us living in a two bedroom flat and I sleep in the lounge where I have made a little room for myself at the end. They frighten me because I donapost want them anywhere near me or my children. We just donapost seem to be getting any better and the stress of being ill and the constant cleaning, hoovering and washing is so exhausting. The children cannot attend school due to being so unwell and Iaposd personally like to thank Bristol Cathedral and Bristol Cathedral Choir School for their wonderful safeguarding advocates for contacting Sovereign Housing early this week as Sovereign had said it was a lease holder issue and they couldnapost get involved.  Back in January, Bristol Live reported on how terried Caroline had been after discovering rats in her flat - and how she had even resorted to cooking on her balcony to avoid attracting them. At the time, Caroline told Bristol Live that upon reporting it to the housing association, she was told they could find no evidence of rats.She said: I think itaposs pretty disgusting to say thataposs the end of it for us because there is no evidence, and yet youaposve got somebody whoaposs living here saying, aposbut they are in my ceilingapos. She later bought an endoscope camera and poked it through a hole in her ceiling and eventually captured on of the rats on video. At the time, Sovereign said they wanted all customers to feel safe and secure in their homes which is why weaposve arranged a number of visits from pest control firms to our shared ownership properties on Hotwell Road. Until very recently, we had not been provided with the video footage which could show where the rats are getting into the building, and we’re hopeful that this will help nail down the point of entry. We’ve been working closely with an officer from Bristol Environmental Health to resolve the issue, putting bait down around the scheme, since this was reported to us in November . We are also scheduling an independent appointment with a second pest control agency, which is due to take place as soon as possible. After Bristol Liveaposs report, Caroline said there seemed to be some action on Sovereignaposs part especially after Environmental Health also stepped in to help me in my plight to prove I was plagued with rats. She also described how Sovereign allowed Ecolab to have three visits but said: You canapost treat pest control effectively in three visits. Eleanor Lowman, regional home ownership manager at Sovereign, said: “We’d like to thank Caroline for expressing concern for her neighbour who we’re pleased to confirm is safe and well.“We’ll be visiting the property tomorrowwith Environmental Health to investigate the cause of the flies and to seek a resolution.“We’d always urge residents with concerns about the welfare of a neighbour to check on them, report it to us or ask the Police to do a welfare check.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ecolab Inc.Public servicesHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Natalie Warke, , repeatedly rammed her VW Golf into her sisteraposs empty car before pushing it across a junction during a family row. Warke was arguing in the street with her eldest son and her sister about her vehicle being pranged. Stunned passers-by watched as she argued with her relatives in the street. Police were called to the scene in Levenshulme, Manchester found Warke slumped at the wheel of the car having snorted cocaine in the run-up to the incident, Manchester Crown Court said.  According to court documents tests showed she had mg of Benzoylecgonine- which is the main metabolite of cocaine - in her blood and she also had traces of cocaine itself in her system. The limit is mg. Warke admitted dangerous driving, drug driving, and having no insurance but walked free after a judge accepted a prison stretch would have a aposharmful effect on her -year-old son. The incident happened at am in May  when Warke got into a row with her sister and other relatives after one accidentally hit her car.  Warke had been diagnosed with epilepsy following a car crash in , the court heard. Andrew Mackintosh, prosecuting, said: This defendant was seen coming to a halt at a junction before driving into a small vehicle parked at the roadside. She pushed it back for a little distance then reversed and drove off only tofrom the opposite direction and push the other car across a road junction. The defendant was seen to get out of her vehicle and there was a disturbance involving other people and that resulted in her getting back into the car. Police arrived at the scene and found her sat in the driveraposs seat. She appeared to be slurring her words and was gurning at the officers who thought was intoxicated. Whilst they asked her for her keys, a member of the public approached them and showed CCTV of the incident. When interviewed the defendant accepted she had deliberately driven her Golf into the vehicles of other family members. She said this was following an argument with her son and several other members of the family. She admitted having driven into the parked car several times and said this was due to her son crashing his car into hers a short time before the incident. This is a case where some damage would have been caused to the other vehicle - however, the other members of the family who own that vehicle have never made a complaint or provided details of what happened. Warke had previous convictions for theft, the court heard. In mitigation defence counsel Andrew Molloy said his client is a single mum and has a son with special needs. Mr Molloy: She is somewhat embarrassed about her performance that day. This incident arose out of an argument and domestic tf she had with her sister. She thoroughly regrets her behaviour. Whilst what happened was unacceptable, there was no persons in the other vehicle and she was alone in her car. There were no pedestrians in the vicinity and very little in the way of traffic passing along the road. If she were to go to custody there would be repercussions for her son. Sentencing Warke, the judge Mr Recorder Michael Armstrong told her: You made a choice to drive whilst under the influence of drugs along a public street before ramming another family memberaposs vehicle on a number of occasions. But immediate custody would have a signicant harmful effect on others in particular your -year-old son. Warke was sentenced to nine months in jail suspended for  months and was ordered to complete  Rehabilitation Requirement Days. She was also banned from driving for two years.

If a person is supervising a driver who is learning, they could be hit with £, fine - as well as a massive six points on their licence. Current rules under the Highway Code make texting or calling while driving illegal. But new rules brought in on Friday means many grey areas have been tightened, making more actions illegal. In , it was ruled in the High Court that an offence was committed when a mobile was used for an interactive communication .  This included calling or texting, but now using a phone for any purpose, is seen as reckless and dangerous. Now drivers can no longer touch their device, take photos or videos, access playlists or use other apps while they drive. Phone use at traffic lights or in motorway queues will also be seen as illegal under new Highway Code rules. Anyone using a device while driving faces a £ fixed fine plus six points added to their driving licence. Motorists are, however, permitted to use their phones to pay at a drive-thru restaurant or a road or bridge toll. The Department of Transport : There will be an exemption to the new law for drivers making a contactless payment using their mobile phone while stationary to ensure the law keeps pace with technology.This exemption will cover, for example, places like a drive-through restaurant or a road toll, and will only apply when payment is being made with a card reader. It will not allow motorists to make general online payments while driving. Hands-free devices can be used when driving including taking calls or using a satnav, but onlyit is secured in something which holds it.

He has let the Queen down once again, says Polly HudsonThe Duke of York, right, with his late father Prince Philip and mother Queen Elizabeth Image: Getty ImagesopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Mar |comments It doesn’t feel that controversial an opinion to say that I never want to see Prince Andrew again.Hard not to assume that most people feel the same way. So it seems impossible that Andrew, and those around him, aren’t aware of that. They must know exactly how popular he is, and that there is nothing that will ever change that.Of course Andrew is entitled to go to a memorial service for his father – but it is utterly tone deaf of him not to have read the room. He clearly should have slipped into the building quietly, sat somewhere discreet, tried to be as invisible as possible. To instead arrogantly rock up front and centre stage, even travelling in a car with the star of the show, is appalling behaviour, even by his standards.If his mother needed assistance on the journey, and down the aisle, there are plenty of other family members who could – who should – have been by her side instead.Andrew has let the poor Queen down, yet again, on what was already a testing day for many reasons. He shouldn’t have put her in that position, he should have insisted on travelling alone, being seated separately, definitely not in the front row, of all places.Sitting smugly in the hot seat makes it seem like he doesn’t understand the seriousness of what has happened, the cloud over him that will never go away – or that he simply doesn’t care. In reality it’s hardly a shock that Andrew hasn’t done the right thing –he was man of honour and integrity he would have nothing to apologise for. Which, let’s never forget, he never has. Palace insiders believe that after today he will effectively disappear from public le. Good riddance.

Richard Grfin, who was responsible for the safety of both the Queen and Prince Philip for  years, was a guest at todayaposs event but was disappointed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided against ing to the UK to pay their respects.Harry has said heaposs unable toto the UK due to safety concerns, which have become the subject of his latest legal battle - this time against the Home Office. Speaking to Sky News, Richard said: William had a great training from [Prince Philip] and is going to learn all his examples for him. Fingers crossed, I just hope Harry gets some of these things into his mind.Asked about his decision not to attend, he said: That was a big disappointment for everybody. He also said that members of the ,-strong congregation were discussing Harryaposs absence before the service began. He said: Certainly around where I was they thought he should have been here. All this nonsense about he couldnapost get protection, as far as Iaposm concerned that was a pathetic excuse, he should have been here to honour his grandfather. At the end of the day,he was that worried about security he could have stuck with his brother and father who have got wonderful security. He would have been more than safe.Richard worked for the royal family for over a decade and said todayaposs service captured the Duke perfectly. Speaking about todayaposs event, he said: To see the Queen come in and sit with her family, that was wonderful.It was very emotional. I worked with Prince Philip for  years and travelled the world with him, I did a lot of things with him and deeply missed him when he died.Prince Philip had a big footprint on the service, you could see it right the way through. It was fantastic to be able to come today and pay our respects. It was a wonderful, wonderful service. He was the most caring man you could possibly meet.  He also shared a story about when his son was diagnosed with cancer and Philip called the hospital to check on him. He also wrote to his we to check on her and on another occassion arranged transport so Mr Grfinaposs daughter could make it home Christmas. Todayaposs event paid tribute to Prince Philipaposs charity work and decades of service to the Queen and the royal family. The Dean of Westminster delivered a moving speech about the Duke. He said: He would hate to think that I should paint a picture of him as a ‘plaster saint’ someone without the usual human foibles and failings. He was far too self-aware ever to be taken in by flattery. Of course, it must be said that his le bore the marks of sacrice and service.  Certainly, he could show great sympathy and kindness. There is no doubt that he had a delightfully engaging, and often self-deprecating, sense of humour. It is quite clear that his mind held together both speculation and common sense. Moreover, nobody would ever doubt his loyalty and deep devotion to our Queen and to their family. Yet, there were times when he could be abrupt maybe, in robust conversation, forgetting just how intimidating he could be. A kind of natural reserve sometimes made him seem a little distant. He could be somewhat sharp in pricking what he thought to be bubbles of pomposity or sycophancy. On the other hand, we should not forget that he himself was sometimes wounded by being unfairly criticised or misunderstood. Like the rest of us, he was part of flawed humanity. Unlike most of us however, he was one of those rare people who remained true to, and guided by, what you might call ‘an inner spiritual compass’ a sense of being called to play a part in the making of a God-intended world. As we give thanks for the le of a remarkable man, perhaps out greatest tribute to him, most especially in these far too troubled times, will be for us to accept the challenge, implicit in his le, to rekindle in our hearts something of that call, and to prayfor the inspiration and the guidance to play our part, however small, in working for a kinder future.

When the Duke of Edinburgh, the beloved husband of the Queen, died last April aged , England was still in the grip of restrictions due to the Covid- pandemic. This meant his funeral, held on April  at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor, was a much scaled-back service, with just  guests and no singing by the guests. It had been Philipaposs express wishes for the congregation to join and sing the rousing hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer at his funeral.  Although the hymn was sung by a small choir, guests at his funeral were not allowed to join in. However, today, this request will finally be fulfilled at todayaposs service when the ,-strong congregation sing the hymn. In addition, Philip, who worked on his own funeral details – codenamed Forth Bridge – for many years, had asked for the choir to sing Te Deum in C by Benjamin Britten, and this will also be part of Tuesday’s proceedings.

Meanwhile, clergy from Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral will all play a special part in the service - at Philipaposs request. Philip had an active role in the day-to-day management of the estates for many years. He wanted the minister of Crathie Church near Balmoral, the rector of Sandringham and the chaplain to the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Windsor Great Park, to take part in his funeral - but Covid restrictions could not allow this.  Nearly all members of the Royal Family will be attending todayaposs event, including Prince Andrew, who will arrive alongside his daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, and their husbands Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and Jack Brooksbank. Also there will be Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their children Lady Louise Windsor and Viscount Severn, the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, the Duke of Kent and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.  However, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are not ing from the US for the service.Around  foreign royals will attend, including Prince Albert of Monaco, Denmark’s Queen Margrethe and Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, who would have originally been on the pre-pandemic guest list. Also invited are Sir David Attenborough, Dame Floella Benjamin, Baroness Grey-Thompson and members of the military who were involved in the funeral, including Pipe Major Colour Sergeant Peter Grant and the Grenadier Guards Bearer Party.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

I am so proud of her - she has blown all expectations out of the water. When she was born, we were told she may not be able to walk or talk. But she has defied the odds and continues to break boundaries. She has achieved so much in such a short period of time. We didnapost know Roni had Downaposs Syndrome until she was born. We were told she may never be able to do certain things and the doctors filled us with negativity. But she has proved everyone wrong.  Roniaposs mum also heaped praise on brands like Burberry who have chosen to encourage ersity and have become more inclusive with their advertisements. I am very impressed that high-end brands like Burberry are being inclusive as it is encouraging for other people with disabilities, she added, thereaposs no reason why children with disabilities shouldnapost have these things too. And while Roni - who has been signed with Zebedee Inclusive Talent Agency since  - is a natural in front of the camera, sheaposs also managed to pick up some other skills too - including skiing, which she has been doing since the age of five. Shelley explained: Roni did take a while to communicate clearly but she makes herself very much understood.  She is a very cheeky, determined and feisty young lady. She has always loved the camera and entertaining people. She started walking at  months old and has become a very determined inidual so Iaposm not surprised that she is excelling. Sometimes, it can be dficult for her as she takes longer to learn things but she never gives up. It is an honour and a privilege to have her in our lives. She learnt how to ski aged five and put her all into it. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agencyhas said after undertaking a safety inspection it was in the process of holding The Pride of Kent on Monday.The firm sparked outrage with protests at ports around the country after getting rid of  seafarers without giving notice on March .PO boss Peter Hebblethwaite will appear before a Scottish Parliament committee on Tuesday, after he was heavily criticised over the job cuts.Now a spokesperson for the MCA confirmed that the Pride of Kent was being held.  They said: Our surveyors are in the process of detaining the Pride of Kent. We are awaiting confirmation of all the detainable items.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the news in a tweet, adding that the ship was being held following an inspection and that safety will not be compromised.It follows the detention of another PO vessel which was held in the Northern Ireland port of Larne on Friday due to failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it believed the MCA acted because of multiple safety and operational breaches, including the wearing of breathing apparatus. The union repeated its demand that the Government seize POaposs entire fleet and take action to get them back in service with the sacked crew reinstated.  General secretary Mick Lynch said: The seizing of the Pride of Kent by the MCA this evening should be adequate evidence for the Government that the gangster capitalist outfit PO are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre. Itaposs rare enough for the MCA to impound a ferry but PO have now had two in a week after the jobs carve up which speaks volumes about the dire state of their operation. Itaposs now high time for these important vessels to be taken over under public control with the sacked crews reinstated as the only way to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely. The MCA said another of the firmaposs vessels, European Causeway, remains under detention in Larne. Shapps wrote to Mr Hebblethwaite earlier on Monday threatening to bring a package of measures to Parliament to block the company from paying below minimum wage. Through that package, I intend to block the outcome that PO Ferries has pursued, including paying workers less than the minimum wage, he said.  The measures could be unveiled on Wednesday. The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and above is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour. He will face the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee on Tuesday after he appeared before a Westminster committee last week. Irish Ferries began operating on the Dover to Calais route in June  in competition with PO Ferries. A PO Ferries spokesman reportedly said: We fully welcome the Governmentaposs commitment to increasing the minimum wage for all seafarers working in British waters. From the outset, we have called for a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes. Our announcement is not about reducing seafareraposs wages, it is to enable us to have a fully flexible crewing model that allows us to meet the demands of our customers. The predicted savings we announced are not solely coming from the reduction in wages, but from removing job duplication and the benefits we will see from increased flexibility.

Maps from WXCharts show temperatures getting colder as the week goes on and spreading further south. It could get as low as -C in central Scotland while it could also be -C on the south coast of England. There are likely to be widespread snow flurries on Thursday morning, with it sticking in the South East, according to the maps, and again on Saturday where there could be up to six or seven centimetres of snow in North Wales and northern England.  Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said: “Much colder weather is on the way and in places there will be snow by the middle of the week.”He continued: “Another area of rain pushing south across the Northern Isles, that is a cold front and it is going to be an important feature over the next few days as it sweeps south across the country. Shetland already in the Arctic air.” It is set to be a cloudy and grey start to Tuesday morning for the east of England and rain in the north and south.  “This area across Scotland mixing with cold air could bring some sleet and snow over the high grounds but that again is a fairly weak feature, said Mr McGivern. To the north of it though much colder air arrives, C to C in the far north of Scotland while temperatures stay above average further south although not as high as they have been with a lot more cloud cover than we have been used to recently. It will get a lot colder, though going into Wednesday. Here’s the cold front by Tuesday night it has become an increasingly important feature as it potentially reactivates with the cold air to bring some snow fall to places by Wednesday and Thursday, said Mr McGivern.  For the start of Tuesday night we are going to see a lot of cloud cover, some cloud, mist and fog in place and here’s the cold front, you can see some snow on it over the Pennines, rain mainly at lower levels. It is slowly sinking south but it’s iding the country in two with a frosty start for Scotland, in parts of the far north of England behind the front, and milder further south albeit with a cloud cover and a few bits of showery rain in places. UK forecast for the next  days Turning much colder and also more unsettled this week. Today: Occasional rain across southern England clearing slowly. Fog and low cloud in central areas retreating to eastern coasts, sunny intervals and scattered showers inland. Rain moving southwards into Scotland, followed by colder weather with wintry showers in the far north. Tonight: Rain and hill snow sinking further south, followed by snow and hail showers in north and east Scotland, with a risk of ice. Further south mostly dry and cloudy. Wednesday: Rain and hill snow continuing southwards bright but distinctly cold to the north, with heavy hail and snow showers. Parts of Wales and southern England seeing sunny intervals and showers. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Cold for all parts with rain, sleet and snow clearing south on Thursday morning. Further wintry showers for many parts through Thursday and Friday.

Washing machines quite obviously have the purpose of washing our clothes, but have you ever thought about the fact your washing machine needs to be washed too  No, I hadnapost really, either, until cleaning queen Faith Earle shared a hack on Facebook for cleaning the little drawer where the detergent goes. As someone who officially fits into the category of people who hate cleaning, it had never occurred to me that the drawerwould need to be cleaned, let alone how I would do it. However, Faithaposs recent post revealed something that lots of us didnapost know - you can actually remove the entire drawer to clean it properly, and have a good scrub around behind it. Taking to the Facebook group Cleaning tips and tricks with before and after pictures of her drawer, Faith wrote: How on earth did I not know this drawer came out !Iaposm now officially an adult and love cleaning haha! Thank you everyone for your cleaning tips and tricks. So, I decided to take a look at my own washing machine drawer, and letaposs just say the results were slightly horrying. Just like Faith said, it turned out there was a little button that allowed me to pull the drawer out completely, and what was hidden behind was an awful lot of mould and filth. I decided to soak the drawer itself in hot, soapy water, before giving it a good old scrub - but washing compartment where the drawer had been was a lot harder. To be perfectly honest, as someone who doesnapost really subscribe to the whole Mrs Hinch lestyle, I wasnapost really sure how to tackle it, but some boiling water, washing up liquid and a toothbrush made it a lot more presentable for now. Itaposs quite grim to think about all the mould that was sitting in a machine which is supposed to leave things cleaner - not more dirty - but until someone invents a self-cleaning washing machine, letaposs spread the word on keeping that pesky drawer clean.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

If you ever struggle to fall asleep at night, you might have turned to YouTube for help and stumbled across ten-hour videos of rain hitting a window, or water in a stream.The incredibly popular videos help people disconnect from their surroundings, and can be especially helpful for those who suffer from stress, or hearing conditions such as tinnitus.But it turns out that Apple included the sounds into their software, and iPhone users can turn on the feature for free whenever they like, and a TikTok tech guru has explained how.What do you think about the iPhone trick  Let us know in the comments... TikTok user HEIMADigital shared the trick in a video, and said the feature can be used to aposmask unwanted environmental noiseapos.To turn on the feature, you have to open the Settings app, then go to Accessibility, scroll down to Audio Visual, then tap aposbackground soundsapos. There youaposll be able to turn on the feature and select which type of sound you would like, with options including ocean, rain, and stream. Apple said the feature can minimise distractions and help you to focus, be calm or rest.

Doctors once again prescribed Nicola steroid creams, and despite providing some initial relief the eczema proved more stubborn. “I started researching on my own because what the doctors could do wasn’t working at all,” Nicola said. I had some really aggressive, painful patches and I didn’t realise it was eczema again. The steroids took away the eczema almost immediately, but would always come back more aggressive.“I used things like shea butter, jojoba oil and vitamin E oil on my skin instead of moisturisers with chemicals in them and these helped a lot. “I was learning a bit more about alternatives to synthetic treatments, but hadn’t learned about topical steroid withdrawalat this point, so still used the weak steroids.”In January , she discovered people on Instagram who had been documenting their journey with TSW – an adverse reaction to discontinuing steroids after a period of usage. As she wasn’t using very strong steroids, Nicola thought that the condition wouldn’t affect her, so she continued to use her medication. But struggling to cope with the painful condition, she decided to stop using the creams once and for all in November . Quickly, her skin deteriorated dramatically. Nicola said: “I started to flare, ooze, crack, swell and bleed within a few days of stopping.“Initially, it felt like out-of-control eczema and just kept spreading, then within a couple of days the other symptoms started. “My skin would ooze wherever I had patches of inflamed and painful skin, which eventually ended up being most of my body after a couple of weeks. “I was aware [of the symptoms] because of the people who decided to document their healing process online, but I was convinced my withdrawal wouldn’t be that bad.“It was so incredibly dry, that I could barely move my joints and I couldn’t fully close my hands, bend my knees and elbows or even turn my head because my neck would crack, bleed and ooze. “My body stopped regulating its temperature, so I’d be sweating when I wasn’t hot and I lost my appetite, where I lost lbs.” Nicola began losing her hair and believes she lost over half during her ordeal, which she cut short due to it being so thin.  As her ears used to crack and ooze, they would end up sticking to the pillow and because her skin was so itchy, she couldn’t find a comfy way to sleep. Although she didn’t feel great about her appearance, her mental health has taken the biggest toll. Nicola said: “I was in so much pain and discomfort and just wanted my skin to feel better again.“I would happily look like this foreverI could just feel better. Obviously I’d rather not have all my skin open for the rest of my le, but at the time I’d have taken any relief. “It was without a doubt the worst experience of my le, as it was incredibly traumatic and there was never a single second where I felt comfortable or pain free. “I didn’t want to deal with it and looking back on it, I have no idea how I actually got through it – especially because I had no idea when it would end.“I barely left my house during the worst, but I was asked a couple of timesI was contagious and was told by the doctor that I looked like I had ‘elephant skin.’ “My partner, Jack Jones, , has been amazing and is one the reasons I managed to make it through each day. “He was basically my carer when I lost the ability to do most things, as he washed my hair, helped brush my teeth and bandaged me every night without fail.“I have a lot of sympathy for those [caring for others with TSW] because it isn’t easy watching your loved one go through such a traumatic experience.” Nicola believes that the experience has made self-acceptance easier for her and as she’s now  months free of steroid use, she feels more comfortable in her looks than ever before. She added: “Right now, my skin is better than it was before and even though I have scars and wrinkly skin, I think I look absolutely fine.“I still get flare-ups of dry, itchy skin in the cold weather which scares me and I start to worry I’m going to go through it again. “I don’t blame doctors and I know that’s a common feeling, as they’re doing what they were taught to do – but it annoys me when some refuse to listen. “Steroids have always been the treatment for eczema, so it’s hard to change minds, but all they have to do is look at how many people have gone through this and got better by doing nothing to our skin. “It isn’t a coincidence that we all get better eventually once we stop steroids, as topical steroid withdrawal isn’t eczema.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jack JonesMental healthVitaminsElephantsSteroidsHealth\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The trio suffered symptoms including red eyes, painful tearing and peeling skin following their meeting in Kyiv. The professor warned that chemical weapons could also be used by Russia to break the stalemate in Ukraine. He added: However implausible a biological or chemical attack once seemed, the United States and its NATO allies need to game out the worst-case scenarios, take inventory of the resources they have at their collective disposal to deal with biological and chemical attacks, and swtly bolster those resources.Just a few weeks ago, the notion that Russia might use such weapons in its campaign in Ukraine would have seemed unduly alarmist. That is no longer the case.  Prof Osterholm added that Putin also aposseemingly has no compunctionapos about using banned weapons against his political enemies. The academic said biological and chemical weapons can achieve in war what bombs and bullets cannot - by reaching civilians hiding in shelters. He warned that poisonous gas could leave areas of Ukraine uninhabitable, while weaponised diseases could spread across the world. It comes after Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with Novichok - just like former Kremlin spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.  The father and daughter were attacked in Salisbury in , while Mr Navalny was poisoned in . In , Putin critic and ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko died in London after being poisoned with radioactive polonium-. Now Cha owner Abramovich, , has allegedly been poisoned while taking part in Ukraine peace talks. The suspected attack has been blamed on hard-liners in Moscow who wanted to foil talks to end the war.  It remains unclear what has caused the symptoms, which may have been triggered by a chemical or biological agent, or a form of electromagnetic-radiation attack. An investigation into the incident was launched by Christo Grozev and a German forensic team was brought in to perform examinations. However, too much time passed between the initial poisoning and these tests, so the suspected poison was unable to be detected. Mr Grozev concluded that the attack was a warning rather than an attempt to kill negotiators. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Mr Abramovich - who took over at Stamford Bridge in  - is said to have travelled back and forth from Moscow, Lviv and other negotiating venues as part of his role in talks, which his spokesperson confirmed on  February. I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since, a statement read. Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement. Thank you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

I had slowly started to think that it was a once-in-a-letime opportunity until fortune smiled upon me one more time.About two weeks ago, I had a busy day at work. To recharge my batteries, I decided to go on a quick walk with the camera.Short-eared owl. Image: Zan BlaszczykAs soon as I left the house, the weather changed its course and the sky was shortly covered by nimbus clouds. Normally I wouldhome and grab my raincoat, but I did not want to waste time.When I arrived at the local reserve, the first rain droplets fell on the ground and the place became deserted. I took a wander and soon spotted a familiar flight pattern above the marshes. Upon checking through my camera, I confirmed it was a short-eared owl.The bird was flying low and patrolling the ground for voles. It even managed to catch one but it was tricky to get a good-quality photo due to the distance between us. The bird flew past me on a couple of occasions but the weather was getting worse with every minute so I headed back home. The word about the owl must have spread, as when I ed two days later, I met other fellow photographers looking for the stunning bird.I ed to the same spot as previously and sat on a rock and waited patiently. Shortly afterwards, a graceful owl with a wingspan of around cm appeared on the horizon. Without changing my position, I started following the bird with the camera. Imagine my surprise when the owl flew over me and looked straight at the camera! I silently shouted to myself: “Wow!”As soon as the owl flew behind me, I slowly turned back and spotted the second bird. Both owls were flying towards each other and, as they met halfway, they started their ‘sky dance’.The male began to rise in the sky whilst performing a combination of dynamic wing beats and gliding down, then rising again. He also made several squeaky calls accompanied by dynamic wing claps at high speeds! After repeating the whole sequence a few times, he started falling from the sky. The female joined in and they started going at each other: the birds were e-bombing one another and attacking with their talons. That aerial display lasted for about  minutes until the birds separated. What a scene it was!Courtship behaviour is spectacular for this species: often, two birds will lock their talons and, whilst holding onto each other, they will start tumbling nearly to the ground before letting go.I encourage everyone who has a chance to observe this behaviour, as this is a ‘must’ in the birding world. It is worth remembering, though, that this species is sensitive to disturbance and their numbers are considered declining during the past two decades. It is crucial not to approach the owls or their nesting site. For your observation, I would recommend choosing one spot and remaining there. This way, you have a chance to show them that you are no threat to them and hopefully the owls will get used to your presence. I prefer this technique rather than hiding as, considering owls’ excellent eyesight, it is almost impossible to stay unnoticed. By waiting at the same position, we can also eliminate another factor, which is chasing off their prey: as we walk, the ground shakes under our feet and small mammals, such as mice or voles which the owls feed on, will disappear. Short-eared owls like marshy and boggy places, so it is important not to walk over the rich habitat but use paths.www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lensIf you have owls living in your backyard or would like me to photograph and feature wildle from your area, please get in touch!"},{"url":null,"title":"brunton-musselburgh-children-star-bugsy-malone","story":"Youth acting group Drama Mill auditioned  children for the show, and now has a cast of  children from North Berwick, Aberlady, Gullane, Cockenzie and Haddington, aged from eight to .Linda Kearsley Ross, Drama Mill director, said that the performance – the group’s first foray into musical theatre – was “ambitious” but that the children had loved taking on the roles of s New York gangsters.County children to star in Bugsy MaloneShe added: “Bugsy Malone was our first choice of play.“Drama facilitators Claudia Overton and Stephanie Wynne and I have all taken part in productions when we were at school and have fond memories of performing this play.“It’s ambitious to do it with such a young castbut our fabulous talented group have risen to the task.“This is the first time we have performed at The Brunton and we are so excited to give our youngsters the opportunity to perform on a professional stage.”The cast will perform the famous musical numbers accompanied by a live nine-piece band, whose members are all volunteering their time and talent.Drama faclitator Stephanie Wynne coaches the young Bugsy Malone castAnd the production will emulate the original  film, starring Jodie Foster, by using splurge guns and foam pies.Linda said: “There is something really fun about playing gangsters and molls, and using splurge to take people down rather than bullets.“Some people criticised that the ending is really abrupt, i.e. that they all become friends and sing a song, but I don’t think children question the ending – they believe bad people can become good people and that, as the words say, ‘ you give a little love then it all comes back to you’.”Tickets can be bought via    or thebrunton en-GB shows bugsy%malone events -

Allied with nearby communities showing similar ambitions, the group is breathing new le into the Firth of Clyde.Over % of the producers are led by female entrepreneurs, a fact that was celebrated on International Women’s Day this year. Isle of Bute Gin Distillery, Braw Liquor Club, Isle of Bute Coffee and the Isle of Bute Smokehouse are among the businesses challenging preconceptions about island living. Recently Highlands  Islands Enterprise provided funding for Bute Kitchen to train and retain hospitality talent, encourage the younger generation and support those looking to change careers or start their own business post-pandemic.“What Bute Kitchen does is it provides an epicentre on Bute for people to collaborate and an opportunity for producers to get to trade shows, get to market and promote what they do. There’s the concept of farm to table producers but there is also the idea of making sure that service matches the produce so that covers the work we are doing in hospitality on the island” explains Cathleen Crichton-Stuart.For the last two years, she has been involved with the collective through her work with the Isle of Bute Smokehouse, which changed name this year to attune with its strong island identity.The oldest fish smoking kiln in Scotland sits in Rothesay, the largest town on the island and a holiday resort that’s rediscovering its relevance. Peter Barr founded the smokehouse in , producing traditional kippers that were sent all over the world – there’s also a story that the west coast favourite made it to Queen Victoria’s breakfast table at Balmoral.In the s, the Ritchie family switched the focus of the business to smoked salmon. Following the Ritchie brothers’ retirement, the company was bought by Cathleen’s father, the late Marquess of Bute, and the smokehouse was extensively refurbished, building a food processing facility around the Barr kiln.“The spirit of collaboration is extremely strong. I see that as a board member of Bute Kitchen but equally as one of the producers. It’s been uplting to see the friendships and collaboration developing. We all want the Bute name, the island, to be associated with really high quality” Cathleen says.The smokehouse continues a local tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation. “The Barr family had a specic recipe that was used for dry curing and smoking fish. That same recipe was passed down to the Ritchie brothers. The Bute family bought the business off them about  years ago. My dad didn’t want that recipe to disappear. It’s lovely because the Ritchie family still come in at Christmas and help us at our busiest period” Cathleen says.“Our head smoker, Alasdair, is really fantastic for the job, he’s an avid fisherman and passionate about what he does. One of the key dferences between us and other smokehouses is that they use field drums to smoke the fish while we are one of the few that have a traditional kiln. We also use sugar in our cure as well as salt. The fish is hand-sliced and it really is an artisan product.”The supply of fresh fish is brought over from Dunoon, practically close enough to see the smoke signals from Bute, “when the weather is wild its easier with the ferry so we can always get our fish” Cathleen explains. “Kippers have been hard to get in the past  months, which is a problem everyone has had but hopefully that will be easier in future.\"The oak-smoked salmon and our smoked trout are our two core products. They are also my two favourites. I think it speaks to the quality of the process that the simplest product is the one that is hard to beat.”Campbell MacFadyen is the development chef at Mount Stuart, the Gothic stately home that is a Bute tourist attraction and a showcase for local produce. He has been on the island for the last seven years and has seen how the passion of producers has revitalised local le.Best of Scotland: The Barras sets out stall for the future“Mount Stuart was a founding partner of Bute Kitchen and we have seen how we are stronger together than we arewe are trying to fight our battles alone” he says. “I think there’s some fantastic produce and a real drive from the producers to grow. I think this is going to be the year where we can really promote the local food and drink that we have.”The house has  acres of gardens including a kitchen garden where the estate’s café sources fruit vegetables and herbs. “Our menu is produce-driven. It’s all about flavour and that’s what drives me. We can source a lovely bit of beef from a farm that’s two miles from my door, you are almost picking out your cow” Campbell says.“Right now we are waiting for the spring lamb. Just this morning, the gardeners have appeared with a crate full of leeks so that will be turned into soups, tarts, quiches and whatever . The milk and cream come in from farms just up the road. That’s what motivates us in the kitchen.”“We plan ahead and we are driven by what’s ready during a particular season. We are already in discussions about what produce to grow next year, we are always looking ahead. If we are hosting a wedding at Mount Stuart I encourage the bride and groom to come and visit the garden and talk about the produce that we can put on the plate.”We are now at the start of the season that Campbell most looks forward to as a chef: “The wild garlic has reared its head in the last fortnight, we’re not far from asparagus as well in Scotland. I’m one of the few chefs that is blessed with having a garden at their mercy and spring really drags you back into things after the winter.”The small independent food and drink businesses that have sprouted around the edges on Bute have provoked a subtle renaissance in Rothesay and across the island, while giving new energy to the existing businesses that have weathered the peaks and troughs of tourist trends and food fads.Macqueens of Rothesay opened as a butcher shop in , Burnside Dexters has the longest established herd of Dexter cattle in Scotland and Zaoni’s Café has been serving ice cream to visitors since .Adding to that, the Braw Liquor Club create locally sourced small batch cocktails, there’s cakes from Electric Bakery, Isle of Bute Gin is created with island botanicals, Spirit of Bute make whisky, local cheese is made with milk from Largievectrean Farm and Bute’s Fruits provide jams, chutneys and preserves. We are close to other west coast destinations that have boosted their food and drink credentials to match the impressive scenery – consider the proleration of seafood restaurants at Loch Fyne, the artisan producers of Arran and sustainable fish farmers of Gigha.Bute is not looking to compete for the summer scrum that descends on Skye or the convoy of motorhomes that arrive at Loch Lomond, but locals are ready to show a dferent side to the island. “I think the pandemic was an opportunity to come up with all these little ideas and make them happen” Campbell says. “I would encourage people to explore Bute, find the wee cafe and shops, take in the view at Ettrick Bay.”Cathleen echoes the sentiment, saying “everything we make on the island has a story behind it” adding that her own favourite spot on Bute is Scalpsie Beach, “you look out towards Arran and you get beautul views across to the mainland, you can do a loop out there and see a bit of the top to tail of Bute.\"There’s a signpost that I enjoy, it points in one direction to Rothesay and in the opposite direction to Rothesay. No matter what, you always know where you are going.”This feature was published in Best of Scotland, free monthly with The Herald on Sunday and Sunday National newspapers.

An unavoidably stressful encounter is made more fraught by the knowledge that beneath the smiling welcome lies a web of emotional tripwires which,triggered, might result in lelong reverberations.The occasion is even trickier for Serena, whose absent family comes under critical scrutiny from her boyfriend before she ever meets his mum and dad. What had seemed a promising relationship begins to unravel while they await the train from her native Baltimore to his home town of Philadelphia. On the concourse they meet one of Serena’s cousins. The awkwardness of their encounter makes Serena’s boyfriend roll his eyes: “I have to say, you guys give a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘once-removed’.”Anne Tyler’s th title follows a long line whose domestic setting and tone belies the depths of feeling, and the often bitter and treacherous currents flowing under the surface. Her distinguished career includes Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, The Accidental Tourist and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Breathing Lessons. Yet, as her latest novel shows, she remains as inquisitive about people and their relationships as in those earlier books.French Braid revolves around the reasons why members of the Garrett clan are almost estranged. “Long long ago when they had still been a family”, reflects one of the dizzying cast in this expertly structured saga of childhood angst and adult dissatisfaction. Not until the final pages, however, are the reasons for the rt explained.Opening her story in , as Serena and her boyfriend await their train, Tyler then leaps back to , where the origins of the Garretts’ trouble began. In the chapters that follow the years click back and forth, like train departures on an old-fashioned notice board.A character first glimpsed by reference to his funeral reappears as a middle-aged father. Later this image is supplanted by his youthful, newly married self, as Tyler fills in the story from each of the protagonists’ perspectives in a revolving, tightly controlled series of present and past vignettes.All the while, the destination of the family train remains the same for all: to fathom those with whom they were raised, not to mention their own children, who fizz like lemonade, bringing zest to the story. Tyler seems to relish depicting the youngest members of the tale, their presence giving the story its intergenerational heft and profundity.Two iniduals in particular shape the plot. The first is David, the youngest of Mercy and Robin Garrett’s three children, seen initially aged seven, full of fun and imagination.The other is his bohemian mother Mercy who, when all the youngsters have fled the coop, follows them. Leaving her husband to run the family plumbing business, she rents a studio where she spends increasing prolonged periods of time. When she is offered an orchid to decorate the studio, she turns it down as “too much to take care of”. No wonder her grown-up daughter Lily thinks her mother “was like those cats who fail to recognise their own kittens after they’ve grown up”.Mercy’s youthful ambition to study art in Paris never came to anything, but she sets herself up as a house portraitist, finding the special “soul” of people’s homes in a corner on the stairway or a grandfather clock. Her style is striking: broad brushstrokes for everything except one object, which she paints in almost off-putting detail.Its an approach Tyler knows well. If you were only to read a page of French Braid, you might wonder where the welter of seemingly incidental colour was leading. She shows her characters’ anxieties over traffic, or clothes, a cascade of information that flows past effortlessly in her easy, deliberately folksy manner.Not for a moment, however, does Tyler ignore the bigger picture. Her laser-like focus goes hand in hand with a firm grasp of the background against which events unfold, be it the historical, geographical, political or social landscape.As this novel demonstrates on several occasions, few are better at covering the passage of time, and hinting at the shting cultural climate in a single sentence. When at one point the narrative jumps forward by several years, and Lily joins the Garrett business, you sense increasingly paranoid America: “she managed the store for her father now that young Pickford had become a survivalist and moved to the wilds of Montana.”If you had to choose a name for Tyler’s literary technique, which has grown more pronounced in recent years, pointilliste might cover it. It can be irksome, requiring complete concentration on small matters, like the orchid, and committing to memory a cast list to rival Les Miserables.The rewards, however, are rich. Not a line of this, or her other fiction, is surplus.Every scrap of conversation is meaningful, as when Lily – pregnant by a married man – reveals how she and her husband no longer get along: “We have absolutely nothing in common.” “Lots of couples have nothing in common,” Mercy told her. “That may be fine for you, Mom, but I’m not going to settle.” “Settle!” Mercy burst out. She felt stung. “Well, aren’t you special!”In that moment, Mercy’s future opens up. At the same time, that of her steady, decent, unexciting husband pitully narrows. It is telling that both his daughters name their first-born child for him. Yet with his own son David, who grows into an absence the minute he leaves for college, Robin leaves an impression of an entirely dferent kind. Belatedly, he gets an inkling of what being a father is about: “maybe parenthood was meant to be educational… a lesson for the parents on totally other styles of being.”Parenting is one of Tyler’s great themes. Equally familiar, and powerfully reworked from ious angles, is the way domesticity can crush the le out of women. Escaping the shackles of motherhood and wedom is one of her oldest refrains, and the consequences of being stled are vividly, persuasively and, as in this novel, poignantly conveyed."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13623382.jpg?type=article-full","title":"pictures-queen-senior-royals-gather-together-remembrance-philip","story":"Front and centre of the high profile occasion was the Duke of York, despite Andrew paying millions out of court earlier this month to settle a civil sexual assault case.Andrew, in his first public appearance since the settlement to his accuser Virginia Giuffre, escorted his mother into Westminster Abbey.The monarch held onto Andrew’s elbow with her left hand as she moved slowly and gingerly to her place, using a walking stick in her right hand.They entered via Poets Corner – a shorter route for the Queen’s comfort – in a small procession.The monarch’s state limousine had arrived at Poets’ Yard entrance with Andrew sat beside her after they travelled from Windsor together.Inside the abbey, they walked at a slow but steady pace, both looking ahead, and at the end of the aisle they separated – with Andrew giving a last glance to his mother as she turned right.As the service began, the Prince of Wales leaned over to the Queen and spoke to her briefly.The Queen delved into her black Launer handbag for her glasses.Andrew, who stepped down from public le over his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, had a front row seat, sitting next to his brother the Earl of Wessex and across the aisle from his other siblings.Among those attending were Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex, the Princess Royal, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.Prince George and Princess Charlotte were also present in honour of their great-grandfather – the first time they have attended a major public church service.Some , people packed the gothic church – in marked contrast to Philip’s funeral where only  were permitted to attend amid Covid restrictions, with the Queen sat alone, masked in mourning.The monarch, , had been determined to make the appearance at the deeply personal and signicant occasion on Tuesday in honour of her “strength and stay” Philip – with her attendance only confirmed the same morning.It was the Queen’s first major official engagement outside one of her homes for nearly six months, since she travelled to Cardf to deliver a speech at the Welsh Senedd on October .The Queen listened as the Dean of Windsor paid tribute to Philip’s intellect, work ethic, sense of humour and devotion to his family.The Right Reverend David Conner described the duke as a “remarkable man” who was committed to “a host of down-to-earth enterprises”.He pointed out that the duke could be “abrupt”, and suggested that at times he could forget “just how intimidating he could be”.Princess Beatrice was seen to give a small chuckle as the Dean remarked: “He could be somewhat sharp in pricking what he thought to be bubbles of pomposity or sycophancy.”The monarch, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Princess Royal were all dressed in dark green – seen as a special tribute to Philip, whose livery colour was Edinburgh Green.Others throughout the congregation also wore the shade, including Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award holder Doyin Sonibare, who delivered a special tribute about the effect Philip’s youth scheme had on her le.The Queen stopped to speak to Ms Sonibare at the end of the service, smiling broadly as they chatted briefly.The monarch was heavily involved in arrangements for the service which featured elements Philip planned for his own funeral which were forbidden due to Covid- restrictions.A rousing rendition of the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer – also known as Bread Of Heaven – was one of his particular requests, but congregational singing was banned at the time of his death.Eleven months on, those who knew and loved Philip sang the anthem with gusto as the song echoed around the vast church.Other missing gestures from Philip’s pre-pandemic Forth Bridge plans saw Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s Award holders and members of the youth UK Cadet Force associations line the steps of the abbey, and prayers being said by the clergy from Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral.Special arrangements were put in place for the Queen’s comfort, with the service limited to  minutes and the monarch sitting in one of the Canada chairs but with an additional cushion.The dficulty for the Queen, who has confessed to not being able to move, was understood to be whether the monarch would be able to walk to her seat."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis

Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year. Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing on the placement.

They have now triumphed in just one of their last  Tests and are winless in five series.But Root, who has been at the helm for an England record  Tests, was steadfast in his belief afterwards that he can transform the team’s fortunes and sees a much brighter future.A dficult defeat to take because I really think there were a lot of positives to come from the way we played for the vast majority of this series. Thank you to our amazing fans out here in the Caribbean and congratulations to Kraigg and his team. pic Hqcdsjp— Joe RootMarch , He posted on his social media channels on Tuesday: “A dficult defeat to take because I really think there were a lot of positives to come from the way we played for the vast majority of this series.“Thank you to our amazing fans out here in the Caribbean and congratulations toKraiggand his team.“After a long winter, it’s time to take a break and recharge ahead of the summer, but I believe in the future of this team.”England were in the ascendancy in the first couple of Tests but settled for stalemates on both occasions after their bowlers were largely blunted by dogged resistance from the Windies batters.But in the decider the Windies lower order established a -run first-innings lead before England subsided to  all out in their second dig, ultimately swinging the series in the hosts’ favour.It ends a winter of discontent for England, following on from being humbled - in the Ashes, and has led to a tidal wave of criticism for Root, with several former players calling for him to resign.England’s  Ashes-winning captain Michael Vaughan, a long-time mentor to Root, said on BBC Radio  Live: “He’s taken it as far as he possibly can.“Tactically he has been poor. It has been a common trend under Joe – he hasn’t managed to grab a game. If he does carry on he’ll really need someone who can drive the tactical side of the game with him.”Nasser Hussain, another former England captain, thinks Root’s current deputy Ben Stokes should now assume the mantle.He told Sky Sports News: “I personally think it is timeto move on. Sometimes you just need to hear a dferent voice.

The European Leagues umbrella group, which includes the Premier League, and fans’ organisations insist qualication has to be earned on the pitch.UEFA has now tweaked the proposal, so that the co-efficient places must be awarded only to clubs who have finished immediately outside the Champions League qualication places in their country – so fth in the Premier League.ECA vice-chairman and UEFA club competitions committee member Aki Riihilahti believes the new proposal strikes the right balance. vw,vw,px, px\"Former Crystal Palace defender Aki Riihilahti, now a vice-chairman of the ECA, has welcomed the revised UEFA proposal “Referring to the European performancespots, I think when you add domestic performance to it, which we did, you have to look for the whole picture – how do we actually have the quality competitions, the premium competitions and then the inclusion,” the former Crystal Palace player, now chief executive of Finnish club HJK Helsinki, said at a press conference following the ECA’s General Assembly in Vienna on Tuesday.“So now, when we add domestic performance, so that the next bestis there, so that there’s no leapfrogging, it’s fair.“It adds value, and overallyou look at the total picture, it makes sense. So asa smaller country champion I was very OK with the whole thing.”It is understood the Premier League is encouraged to see UEFA moving away from the original proposal on co-efficient places, and that it intends to work closely with all stakeholders to review any new proposals in the next stage of the process.The new Champions League format, set to come into effect for the - season, would feature  teams instead of the current  all playing in one league.The format signed off last April involved each team playing  matches under the so-called ‘Swiss system’, with the top eight qualying for the last  knockout stage by right and the next  clubs in the table playing off for the remaining eight slots.Riihilahti believes the proposals are an improvement on the current situation for UEFA associations ranked th downwards.There would be a minimum of  domestic champions represented across the group stages of the three European competitions – the Champions League, Europa League and the Europa Conference League, which is in its inaugural season.Runners-up from a minimum of  countries would also have a chance of Europa League qualication, where before they could only qualy for the Conference League."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-senior-royals-gather-together-moving-remembrance-philip  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Commencing on Wednesday  March, Fun Factory Ballymena will host a series of quiet play sessions for autistic children, during which visitor entry numbers will be signicantly reduced, lighting will be dimmed and no loud music will be played. A six-month pilot of the initiative, which is supported by Council’s Community Planning Partnership, will see the sessions offered on the last Wednesday of every month between March and October from .pm to .pm . The sessions align with Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s strategy to make Mid and East Antrim an Autism Friendly Borough as part of its Community Plan. Partnering with a wide range of organisations, including The Fun Factory, Council is creating a strong, vibrant, safe and inclusive community in which local citizens, businesses and community organisations work together to improve the lives of everyone. Council remains strongly committed to ensuring Mid and East Antrim is an accessible, safe, welcoming and inclusive place for every person living in or visiting the Borough. In , it was awarded the prestigious ‘Autism Impact Award’ for six of its venues in recognition of “going above and beyond” to create accessible and ‘autism-friendly’ environments – including Seven Towers Leisure Centre and The People’s Park. These award accreditations were presented by Autism NI, in partnership with the Northern Health and Social Care Trust .Pamela, Manager of The Fun Factory, commented: “The Fun Factory is very much behind Council’s ambition to be as accessible and inclusive as possible for every person of every age, background and ability living in or visiting our Mid and East Antrim – it’s something we very much strive to achieve in our own business. “We passionately believe that every child deserves the chance to have a fun and enjoyable experience in an environment in which they feel safe and comfortable.

The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs. Please do so - and benefit from the really important protection they bring.” The one million landmark has been reached with the Spring booster campaign imminent. In line with UK-wide guidance set by the JCVI, the Spring campaign will offer an additional booster dose to: anyone who is aged  or over care home residents and anyone aged  and over who has a severely weakened immune system.

Protection from the vaccine may be lower and may decline more quickly in these people.”She explained that while vaccines provide good protection against severe Covid- disease, protection against the Omicron iant seems to decline quickly even after a booster dose.She said the spring booster dose would help to address this.“This spring booster is being offered as a precaution to those at extremely high risk, most of whom received their first booster around six months ago. If the number of infections increases over the summer, this booster should help to reduce your risk of being admitted to hospital with Covid-.”The spring booster programme will begin in care homes from the start of April and will be carried out by community pharmacies.GPs will invite all their eligible patients who are aged over  for vaccination.They will also have the option to receive the booster at a participating community pharmacy or at a HSC Trust-led vaccination clinic.Health Trusts will also continue to run some vaccination centres as well as mobile clinics pop-up clinics.District nursing teams will continue to vaccinate the eligible housebound patients.Immunosuppressed iniduals are also eligible for the spring booster as long as there is at least three months since their previous dose.The Public Health Agency say Trust clinicians should write to advise their patients of this while GPs should provide a “safety net” service.Practices will be able to offer vaccination to any of their registered patients who meet the criteria of immunosuppressed at patient request of by practice identication.“COVID- has not gone away and we would urge those eligible to come forward for the spring booster when invited,” added Dr Johnston.Further infromation is available online at www.pha.site springbooster or by visit the NI Direct website.Most ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body findNorthern Ireland fashion designer’s ‘incredible surprise’ as Kate wears Rixo dress in BahamasTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoir\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for BelfastLatest CoronavirusCo Antrim woman on nightmare of discovering seven-year-old daughter Emma had rare bone cancer‘My husband was killed by a disease he didn’t believe was real’ – former Strabane DJ Joe McCarron’s widow on his death from CovidReids Shoes of Sandy Row goes up for sale for £, to mark the end of an eraMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageViewpointOpinionParents need more information on jabLatestPierre Zakrzewski, the Irish cameraman killed in Ukraine, remembered as a truth teller and humanitarian as he is laid to restTributes to ‘bubbly girl’ who died after being injured in rugby matchBoris Becker tells court he does not know where his Wimbledon trophies areNo  insists Johnson did not mislead MPs – despite Met finding law was brokenJohnson warns Putin could ‘twist the kne’ as Russian forces falter,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pic: Jonathan McCambridge PA WireMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe results are in from our Spring  NI ‘Tracker’ poll, and we see that Sinn Fein are still comfortably in the lead as Northern Ireland’s largest party on a projected % vote share - up a % point from our Winter poll in January.Sinn Fein have now been the lead party in all polls for some time, and so they must be really hoping that they can achieve top spot in the May  election.The DUP are up two points in second place on %, and are seven points behind Sinn Fein.The other two unionist parties have dropped a bit, with the UUP on % - down a point since our January poll, and the TUV on % . Even so, this % score is still three times more than the TUV achieved in the last NI Assembly election in .So the trend is good for the DUP with perhaps some of their regular voters who moved to the TUV ing to the fold as the Assembly election approaches.However they still have a big gap to make upthey are to catch Sinn Fein, and there’s not much time left.The SDLP are at least consistent in the polls, coming in this time at % - no change from our Winter poll in January.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up  Read MoreLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindThe SDLP has been showing around the %-% vote-share mark for a long time, with no real up or down movement either way. Alliance are at %, up  points, perhaps benefiting from the UUP’s small drop.About this UUP drop, it’s noteworthy that Doug Beattie’s personal ‘leader rating’ in this poll was down  points from his January poll score, which is a hefty drop.Perhaps the Twitter posts controversy has been a factor here, and interestinglythis seems to have had more of a negative impact with female voters than males.Boris Johnson had the biggest increase in our ‘leader ratings’ - up  points from his January poll-score. This reflects the national UK-wide polls with the PM benefiting from a ‘Ukraine war bounce’. However, he still remains Northern Ireland’s lowest rated political leader at minus !Now the science of opinion polling applies to modelling and forecasting NI-wide public opinion, ie projecting vote-shares – that’s what polls do, and they usually do this pretty accurately.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:OpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionJon Tonge:OpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveBut, of course, what people really want to knowis how all these vote-shares would translate into seats at the Assembly election.As the political commentators will tell you, vote-shares don’t always translate neatly into NI Assembly seats.Indeed, it’s perfectly possible for the TUV to get a %-% NI-Wide vote-share in this election, and for Jim Allister to still be the only TUV MLA – although, with that NI vote-share, they would have to be a bit unlucky for that to happen. It’s all down to where, and in what constituencies, the votes come from.So for our last pre-NI Assembly election pollwe will be running  separate NI constituency polls with the named candidates and parties for each constituency, presented to each poll respondent.Basically the poll-participants will be presented with actual ballot they will see in each of their respective constituencies on election day. Then, like we do with all our polls, we will combine all this data into NI-wide political-party vote-share projections.This approach brings in some of the reality of the election, as there’s always a brand and loyalty factor with some named candidates. We used this approach in our very last pre- UK general election poll, and we believe it was one of the factors that allowed us to forecast that election to within %. We will seeit works as well again – we hope it does!Bill White is managing director of Belfast polling and market research company LucidTalkRelated topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblySinn FéinUlster Unionist PartyAlliance PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceSDLPLucidTalk pollMore On Northern Ireland AssemblySDLP’s Colum Eastwood leaves opposition ‘on the table’ depending on negotiations following Stormont Assembly Election PremiumSam McBrideOpinionWhy we all may be paying more for electricity thanks to Stormont failures and a little-known monopoly company PremiumLindy McDowellOpinionHow do you say ‘farcical waste of money’ in Irish and or Ulster Scots  PremiumAlex KaneOpinionUnionism remains as ided in  as it was in , now it might be too late to do things dferentlyStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesMost ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindNorthern Ireland fashion designer’s ‘incredible surprise’ as Kate wears Rixo dress in BahamasTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoir\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections SDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemns attempts to intimidate candidatesProtocol does not represent the best of both worlds for NI, DUP leader tells NI Chamber of CommerceSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismJon TongeOpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveUnionists more worried about NI Protocol than living costs, reveals LucidTalk pollLatestRevealed: What’s inside the Oscars  gt bags worth ,Charity announces funds for touring musicians hit by Brexit red tapeJoe Root emphasises ‘positives’ as scrutiny on England captaincy intensiesA closer look at England’s penalty experience after Gareth Southgate’s comments‘Industry titan’ Josh Berger is new chair of Brit School’s board of trustees,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paul, Charlotte and Conor are shattering old certainties, they are stepping up and stepping in to put people first. And they will have my support every step of the way.”Posting a video on Twitter, Paul Doherty said he and his colleagues were approached by a group of men as they were putting up posters on the Shankill Road.We were approached by a group of men who said we weren’t welcome in this area and threatened that our posters would be taken down,” he said.What was even more frustrating was the fact that we tried to engage and have a conversation about what really matters.”He said this included issues like health, housing and the cost-of-living.But they were too concerned about certain rhetoric around the protocol. This narrative isn’t representative of the views of many I know and have supported here in this community,” he said.And it won’t deter us to continue to work for people in these areas,” adding that he was standing to represent everyone in the community regardless of their political outlook.It’s time we toned down this toxic political rhetoric and focus on the issues that really matter.”Related topicsSDLPColum EastwoodMore On SDLP PremiumBill WhiteOpinionDUP running out of time to catch Sinn Fein but vote-shares don’t always translate to Assembly seatsLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindSDLP’s Colum Eastwood leaves opposition ‘on the table’ depending on negotiations following Stormont Assembly Election PremiumGail WalkerOpinionIf Stormont worked, the NI Protocol would be settled and we’d have the ‘best of both worlds’… this election will make no dference to real lives PremiumLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’Most ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindNorthern Ireland fashion designer’s ‘incredible surprise’ as Kate wears Rixo dress in BahamasTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoir\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections Protocol does not represent the best of both worlds for NI, DUP leader tells NI Chamber of CommerceSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismBill WhiteOpinionDUP running out of time to catch Sinn Fein but vote-shares don’t always translate to Assembly seatsJon TongeOpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveUnionists more worried about NI Protocol than living costs, reveals LucidTalk pollLatestPierre Zakrzewski, the Irish cameraman killed in Ukraine, remembered as a truth teller and humanitarian as he is laid to restRevealed: What’s inside the Oscars  gt bags worth ,‘Signicant’ fall in people fully self-isolating since Covid- rules scrappedCharity announces funds for touring musicians hit by Brexit red tapeJoe Root emphasises ‘positives’ as scrutiny on England captaincy intensies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: NCA PARobin SchillerMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe -year jail term handed down to the Kinahan cartel’s “main man in the UK” marks a signicant victory in the fight against the international drugs gang.Thomas ‘Bomber’ Kavanaghoperated a lucrative network which saw more than €m worth of drugs hidden inside industrial machinery being smuggled into the UK in a single year.However, the high-ranking associate will be out of circulation until he is well into his s, when he is released on licence from the longest jail term he has received in a criminal career spanning over five decades.Born on September , , Kavanagh grew up in south central Dublin and was on the garda radar by the time he turned .In April  he picked up his first criminal conviction, and over the next  years was regularly in the dock for offences involving firearms, burglary, making threats to kill and assault.By the turn of the century, he was considered a serious player in organised crime and came into the sights of the recently formed Criminal Assets Bureau .The Bureau later secured an order for more than £, in unpaid taxes from the proceeds of his criminality.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As a result of the increasing garda pressure, Kavanagh moved his family to the English Midlands in the early s, eventually settling in Tamworth, near Birmingham.He set up TK Motors in  which bought cars at auction before exporting them for profit to Ireland. Investigators believe he made “quite considerable” s from this enterprise which included trading cars across Europe and even in Dubai. However, they suspect he relied mainly on crime to fund his lestyle.While in the UK, gardaí suspect ‘Bomber’ was also linked to major drug shipments imported into Ireland through his contacts across continental Europe.By  his wealth was growing and that year he used fake documents to re-mortgage his £, home, a fraud for which he later received a fully suspended -month sentence. The house was lavishly refurbished, while a state-of-the-art security system, fortied gates, reinforced doors and bullet proof glass were also installed.His influence had also expanded across the Midlands and the National Crime Agencyassessed that his rise led to him becoming the Kinahans’ “figurehead” and “top man” in the UK. While his Europe-wide empire grew, garda intelligence in late  indicated that Kavanagh was rarely,ever, sighted in Ireland. That changed after February , , when his brother-in-law David Byrne was shot dead at the Regency Hotel in Drumcondra. Byrne was considered a close associate of the Kinahan gang in Dublin along with his older brother Liam. The murder would lead to a spate of gun murders, with  people killed in Ireland and Spain.He was a prominent mourner at the funeral  days later where he was joined by associates including feud killer Freddie Thompson and the Kinahan brothers Daniel and Christy Jnr. Also at the funeral service was an unknown middle-aged man, who garda inquiries would later determine was Declan Brady.Gardaí immediately began investigating the unassuming haulier who became known as ‘Mr Nobody’ and would turn out to be Kavanagh’s man in Ireland.The following January, Irish detectives raided a business in Dublin’s Greenogue industrial estate where they found ‘Mr Nobody’ along with two other men and an arsenal of high-powered weapons. More than €m worth of drugs were also seized in a later search.Financial documents led back to a logistics firm in the Midlands linked to Dublin brothers-in-law Gary Vickeryand Daniel Canning .As part of Operation Hornstay, a search at Dover Port in October  led to drugs worth €m hidden inside industrial machinery being seized, and the two men were arrested.Examinations of their devices showed they were receiving instructions from a man referred to as ‘The Gaffer’.Investigators also had to decipher the codewords used “Paper” was money, “Phones” were blocks of cocaine, “Sister’ was the machinery”, “Jelly” referred to Vickery while “Smiley” was Canning.In one email a week before the Dover bust ‘The Gaffer’ told his subordinates: “Ta put safe in sister and jelly b on in couple hours did not want to get him up tis morning from beauty sleep :”.The NCA established that this man was Thomas Kavanagh, who also used the alias Paul Christopher Harvey.The father of six was arrested at Birmingham airport on January , , while ing from a family holiday in Mexico.An encrypted BQ Aquaris device was found in his suitcase, indicating the cartel associate conducted business while on holiday.His luxury home was searched, and cash totalling £,, expensive watches, jewellery and luxury clothing seized. Weapons were also found, including knives, bats, and a pink stun gun disguised as a torch — for which he received a three-year jail term.More trouble was to come when he was charged along with Vickery and Canning in relation to the drugs importation conspiracy.The NCA suspects they imported €m worth of drugs into the UK between September  and October .​​​Judge Martyn Levett jailed him for  years at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday. Vickery and Canning were given prison terms of  and -and-a-half years respectively for their roles in the syndicate.All three will serve half of their sentences out on licence.After the hearing, NCA deputy director Matt Horne described Kavanagh as a “high-ranking member of the Kinahan cartel” and “their main man in the UK”.They will now go after The Gaffer’s assets, including his Tamworth home and any items bought with the proceeds of crime.Most ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body findNorthern Ireland fashion designer’s ‘incredible surprise’ as Kate wears Rixo dress in BahamasTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoir\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for BelfastLatest Republic of IrelandPierre Zakrzewski, the Irish cameraman killed in Ukraine, remembered as a truth teller and humanitarian as he is laid to restHealth service under ‘huge pressure’ amid fresh surge in Covid casesPO Ferries refuses plea from Grant Shapps to reverse decision to sack workersIrish cameraman killed in Ukraine remembered as ‘truth teller’ at funeralMalachi O#DohertyOpinionWhy the loyalist threat now has an agenda for its actionsLatestPierre Zakrzewski, the Irish cameraman killed in Ukraine, remembered as a truth teller and humanitarian as he is laid to restNo  insists Johnson did not mislead MPs – despite Met finding law was brokenJohnson warns Putin could ‘twist the kne’ as Russian forces falterRevealed: What’s inside the Oscars  gt bags worth ,‘Signicant’ fall in people fully self-isolating since Covid- rules scrapped,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us. France — Emanuel, I really believe that you will stand for us. Slovenia stands for us. Slovakia stands for us.“The Czech Republic stands for us. Romania knows what dignity is, so it will stand for us at the crucial moment. Bulgaria stands for us. Greece, I believe, stands with us.“Germany... A little later. Portugal — well, almost... Croatia stands for us. Sweden — yellow and blue should always stand together. Finland — I know you are with us. The Netherlands stands for the rational, so we’ll find common ground. Malta — I believe we will succeed. Denmark — I believe we will succeed. Luxembourg — we understand each other. Cyprus — I really believe you are with us.“Italy — thank you for your support! Spain — we’ll find common ground. Belgium — we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I’m sure of it. Ireland — well, almost.”The Ukrainian leader offered no further reasons for his comment.While fully backing the Ukrainian push for EU membership, Ireland has not abandoned its position of military neutrality in the face of the Russian assault.EU leaders have so far resisted the call to accelerate the accession of Ukraine to the bloc.Taoiseach Micheal Martin has since played down Zelensky’s comments, claiming the Ukrainian leader was talking in terms of the ‘European perspective’.Related topicsSinn FéinUkraineLucidTalk pollMore On Sinn Féin PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idle PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismBelfast man in court accused of threat to kill MP John Finucane PremiumBill WhiteOpinionDUP running out of time to catch Sinn Fein but vote-shares don’t always translate to Assembly seatsBelfast City Council to host ‘Day of Reflection’ to acknowledge pain and hurt caused by the TroublesMost ReadTwo arrested and murder investigation launched after man’s death in NewtownabbeyWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge matchBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body findNorthern Ireland fashion designer’s ‘incredible surprise’ as Kate wears Rixo dress in BahamasTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoir\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we JadaPlayWatch: Ken Branagh emotional over #very meaningful# Oscar win for BelfastLatest Republic of IrelandPierre Zakrzewski, the Irish cameraman killed in Ukraine, remembered as a truth teller and humanitarian as he is laid to restHealth service under ‘huge pressure’ amid fresh surge in Covid casesPO Ferries refuses plea from Grant Shapps to reverse decision to sack workersIrish cameraman killed in Ukraine remembered as ‘truth teller’ at funeralMalachi O#DohertyOpinionWhy the loyalist threat now has an agenda for its actionsLatestPierre Zakrzewski, the Irish cameraman killed in Ukraine, remembered as a truth teller and humanitarian as he is laid to restAndrew’s role at Philip’s service ‘didn’t happen by chance’ – royal commentatorNumber of patients in hospital with Covid hits record high for fourth dayUEFA’s revised Champions League qualication plans ‘fair’ and ‘add value’ – ECATributes to ‘bubbly girl’ who died after being injured in rugby match,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Abbey in London By Catherine Wylie, PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Duke of York’s prominent appearance at his father’s memorial service was the Queen’s way of showing that her second son still has a role to play at family occasions, according to a royal commentator.Andrew was front and centre of the high-profile occasion at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, despite paying millions out of court earlier this month to settle a civil sexual assault case.The duke escorted his mother and had a front row seat at the televised service – his first public appearance since the settlement to his accuser Virginia Giuffre. and the Earl of Wessexduring the service \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_adf-d-ce-aa-bda_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph

such a prominent role is that it is a reminder of his “many errors of judgment that have led him to being removed from public le”.Mr Hunt tweeted that in having Andrew carry out his role, it was a sign of the Queen “endorsing” him, and he told the PA news agency: “It didn’t happen by chance.“He could have sat in the congregation with others, with his relatives, but they actively decided that he would have this role of supporting her.“So she has chosen, in essence, to remind people that he hasn’t admitted any wrongdoing, he’s not guilty of anything, he’s innocent.“And she’s very clearly stating that he has a role at family occasions.”Mr Hunt raised the question of whether the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge would have been supportive of Andrew having this role at the

intervene  And clearlythey did then they failed.”He added: “I think you have to start from the basis that Charles and William will have been in the driving seat with the Queen of removing Andrew from public le.“Both of them will have been very aware of the risks of Andrew having this role, so either they decided that they could justy it on the basis that it was an event for his father, or they did try to suggest this wasn’t a good idea and the Queen chose not to listen to them.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adf .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_adf-d-ce-aa-bda_embedded

of York leaving the service Mr Hunt said he imagines Andrew will have been “very keen” to escort his mother, adding: “It would be for others to dissuade him.”The former correspondent wondered how the move will be perceived in the United States and where in the world.“It’s one thing to organise an event to satisfy the needs and the desires of the family members, it’s quite another to then step back from it and see how it is seen around the world, and I don’t yet know what that judgment will be.“But the risk for them is it reopens yet again the whole can of worms for them about Prince Andrew’s judgment. It reminds them about his missteps and it raises questions about the wisdom of allowing him to have a prominent role when he could just have attended as everyone  did,” he said.But another royal commentator said Andrew’s role of escorting the Queen may have been a matter of “practicality” as much as anything .Askedhe viewed Andrew’s role at the service as a way of the Queen showing support for her son, Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine, told the PA news agency: “It’s hard to interpret how it came about.“I’m not sure that the Queen would necessarily regard it in that way.”He said it might have just been “a practicality as much as anything” and a plan that “fitted the purposes of the occasion”.Mr Little added: “I mean, clearly with him by her side, then the support is there physically and in every other way, really.”He noted Andrew has not been found guilty of anything, adding: “It’s a complicated situation on a very personal level for the Queen as his mother.”Mr Little pointed out that, like the Queen, Andrew travelled from Windsor for the service and it may have “made sense to have a member of the family travel with her”.Askedhe was surprised by Andrew’s role, he said: “I suppose we should always expect the unexpected on big royal occasions, and I don’t think anybody had guessed that this is what would happen.“But I suppose we could look at it in many ways.”He added: “Clearly it’s the first time that we’ve seen him for a long time, since all the legal wranglings were settled, so some people will argue that he shouldn’t have been as prominent.“But then we have to remember that he was the Duke of Edinburgh’s son.“So, you know, really, he is just as entitled to be there as his siblings.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

We applied for visas to enter New Zealand on compassionate grounds three weeks ago but have had no confirmation or updates yet.Borders in New Zealand remain closed to oversea visitors as they prepare for the countryrsquos Covid- peak, but indications show they may reopen in May.Mrs McDonald said that her family has been overwhelmed by the generosity of people and their messages of support, but particularly the messages of hope they have received from people who have recovered from aHUS.ldquoFollowing our campaign to bring Alan home, many people reached out to share their experiences of either having aHUS or caring for a family member suffering from it, she said.ldquoThis has brought us so much comfort, hearing how others, especially those closer to home, have been through a similar situation and are through the other side, living their lives to the full again.The family is now exploring all the options to ensure Alan will have the necessary medical support to enable him to make the long journey home to Newcastle.They are working closely with the British Embassy, New Zealand Health Authorities and the local Health Trust in Northern Ireland in preparation for his arrival on Irish soil..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Preserving our past  ","story":"DOWN County Museum is currently threatened by plans to reduce and downgrade its staffing.Over many years high levels of community engagement and public support have enabled the Museum to build its collections.It is vital that the appropriate resources are deployed not only to care for and interpret the collections but also to maintain and develop links between the collections and the wider community.Take, for example, the museumrsquos photographic archive.Although the D J McNeill collection may be the best known and certainly the most extensive collection of photographs, the museum is responsible for the care and use of many more images.They represent all parts of County Down, of landscapes, towns and villages, inidual and group portraits, people at work, playing sport, historic events and everyday le.Two Men of Mourne was the title of a book published by Down County Museum in , based on photographs in the museum collection.The book highlights the work of two men who had spent many years photographing the Mournes and south Down.Pat Hudson, from Kilkeel, trained as a pharmaceutical chemist, but was a keen photographer ever since his early experience with a box Brownie camera.As an adult he captured the essence of the countryside he loved.His sister, Catherine, described his inquisitive and adventurous spirit which led Pat to leave Ireland in , first to work in an East African pharmacy.Then, after a short time in Jersey, he emigrated to Australia. After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

On the contrary, he is humble and been loyal to the city in which he was born, even in the heady years when he was rising towards Hollywood stardom.His film ‘Belfast,’ with its first rank local cast and a homegrown soundtrack too , is a tribute to Northern Ireland and its capital city and the resilience of the people who live here.We know what a wonderful place this is, despite the trauma from the former troubled years.

And she asked what I did for my Duke of Edinburgh’s award.”The -year-old, who has an ambassador role with the award, said: “I just got a message from my mum, she said ‘Congratulations, really proud of you’.”She added of her own green outfit: “I think it was just a crazy coincidenceI’m honest, but it’s quite nice, like we’re all in sync.”The monarch was heavily involved in arrangements for the service which featured elements Philip planned for his own funeral which were forbidden due to Covid- restrictions. vw,vw,px, px\"Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Michael of Kent A rousing rendition of the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer – also known as Bread Of Heaven – was one of his particular requests, but congregational singing was banned at the time of his death.Eleven months on, those who knew and loved Philip sang the anthem with gusto as the song echoed around the vast church.Other missing gestures from Philip’s pre-pandemic Forth Bridge plans saw Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s Award holders and members of the youth UK Cadet Force associations line the steps of the abbey, and prayers being said by the clergy from Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral.Elements of today’s Service will incorporate some features planned for the Funeral of The Duke of Edinburgh, which were unable to go ahead due to Covid restrictions in place at the time.Read the Order of Service 👇— The Royal FamilyMarch , Special arrangements were put in place for the Queen’s comfort, with the service limited to  minutes and the monarch sitting in one of the Canada chairs but with an additional cushion.The dficulty for the Queen, who has confessed to not being able to move, was understood to be whether the monarch would be able to walk to her seat..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Queen and senior royals gather together in moving remembrance of Philip article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Announcing the bounce back support scheme, Mr Poots said: “Many businesses and sectors were adversely affected by the Covid- pandemic, and our agricultural shows were not immune to these effects, with all shows cancelled in  and only a few being able to take place in . This resulted in shows losing the opportunity to raise vital funds that would help prepare for the  season. “Shows play a vital role in showcasing our excellent agri-food produce and supporting our rural communities, as well as boosting our economy and the additional tourism opportunities. These shows are predominately run by many volunteers who give of their free time and I would like to extend my thanks to them for all of their hard work. “Pre-pandemic agricultural shows attracted more than , visitors. It is essential therefore that NI shows have the opportunity to run a full schedule this year to promote and facilitate future economic growth for agri-food businesses and I am pleased that I can support their efforts through the provision of the pound, bounce back support scheme I’ve announced today, which will allow each show to claim up to a maximum of poundk for new or increased costs. “Departmental officials will contact shows directly in the next few weeks to assist them in availing of my support scheme.” Looking to the future, Mr Poots has announced plans for an independent review of local agricultural shows, which will explore the potential for longer term support options and help shows remain sustainable in the years ahead. He added: “Although I am providing support to our local shows this year, I am of the view that Government departments and local councils should consider options for longer term support. “I am therefore announcing plans for an independent review to commence in the next month or two which will aim to explore future support options and guide future policy, in addition to identying new and innovative methods which would be utilised by local shows to help safeguard their future.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdbafebcecb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eaafaecebfecbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1635169051553.jpg--hargey_tackles_digital_exclusion_through_provision_of_free_broadband.jpg?163516905100","title":"hargey tackles digital exclusion through provision of free broadband ","story":"Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has announced the provision of free broadband for those facing digital exclusion as a barrier to work.

The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edfbafbbecec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebffdfbabddba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1613125631842.jpg--booster_third_dose_milestone_welcomed.jpg?161312563100","title":"booster third dose milestone welcomed ","story":"The number of COVID- vaccine boosters and third doses administered in Northern Ireland has passed the one million mark. The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs. Please do so - and benefit from the really important protection they bring.” The one million landmark has been reached with the Spring booster campaign imminent. In line with UK-wide guidance set by the JCVI, the Spring campaign will offer an additional booster dose to: anyone who is aged  or over care home residents and anyone aged  and over who has a severely weakened immune system.
