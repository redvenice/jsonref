The FT has more details: Mining giants are still weighing the Footsie down, though, following the drop in commodity prices today. Stocks are bouncing back after two days of heavy losses, with the main indices all rallying, and tech stocks among the risers. Here’s the situation: The mood may has been brightened by today’s fall in US jobless claims, which indicate that American firms are seeing stronger demand. That may be helping investors shrug off the jump in producer prices last month -- even though it highlights the dilemma facing the Federal Reserve as it wonders how long to maintain its stimulus package. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is liveblogging the action here: The Bureau of Labor Statistic says: It underlines that firms are putting up prices, following the surge in commodity prices and rising demand as pandemic restrictions are eased (as we saw with yesterday’s jump in Consumer Price inflation). But the sharp annual increase in the PPI also follows the slump in demand in April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. So says Daniel Zhao of Glassdoor, on Twitter: Zhao is also concerned about the impact of some US states withdrawing from expanded unemployment benefits programs early (these states are arguing that the economic emergency is over, and its time to return to work). AnnElizabeth Konkel of Indeed explains: But, there were also around 3.7 million people still receiving “continuing claims” (so for at least two weeks). And overall, nearly 16.9 million Americans were receiving unemployment support at the end of April, the Department of Labor shows: Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute says unemployment claims are moving in the right direction, although still too high (especially once you add claims to the PUA, or pandemic unemployment assistance, programme, for self-employed and gig economy workers). Around 473,000 ‘initial claims’ for jobless support were filed last week (to Saturday 8 May), on a seasonally adjusted basis. That’s the lowest reading since jobless claims surged back in mid-March 2020, in the first wave of Covid-19. It’s down from 507,000 in the previous week (which has been revised up), showing that US companies are laying off fewer staff as the economy strengthens. But, it’s still more than double the levels of jobless claims before the pandemic: There was also a notable rise ‘social spending’ last week, suggesting that more people were travelling eating out since pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve outside. Hospitality firms have also been looking to hiring more staff, ahead of the next easing in England next Monday which will allow people to meet indoors again. Investors are clearly worried that central banks will take action to cool inflation (even though at least some of the recent prices rises appear transitory). Hargreaves Lansdown, the investment firm, flagged today that it is starting to see a drop in dealing volumes, saying: Like other brokers, Hargreaves Lansdown benefited from the jump in retail trading under lockdown. More younger clients turned to share dealing, with groups such as WallStreetBets driving interest in “meme stocks”, while rising markets delivered strong gains if you managed to buy during last year’s lows. Alphawave, whose semiconductor technology is used in high-speed data networks, sold shares at 410p each, valuing the Toronto-based firm at around £3.1bn. Alphawave designs high-speed connectivity technology for chips used in areas such as data centres, artificial intelligence, 5G, data networking and self-driving cars. It licenses this intellectual property to major tech firms – a major growth area, given the demand for faster wireless and the growth of the Internet of Things. Alphawave chose to float in London rather than New York, despite concerns that Deliveroo’s disastrous IPO could have hurt the City’s appeal to tech firms. It’s a tricky week to be floating, of course, given the market volatility and the recent move away from tech stocks. But such a tumble suggests the float may have been priced rather too richly, as Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says:  Here’s some more reaction, from Ben Martin of The Times: And Abhinav Ramnarayan of Reuters: Andy Haldane, the outgoing Bank of England chief economist, has predicted that UK growth and inflation will both accelerate this year... meaning that policymakers need to start “tightening the tap” on their stimulus. Writing in the Daily Mail today, Haldane reiterates his earlier optimism for a strong recovery – saying Britain could bounce back like a tennis ball. He argues that the UK could outpace international rivals: But... Haldane also warns that the Bank of England needs to ensure that this boom does not turn to bust with an unwanted bout of inflation. Last week, Haldane was a lone voice on the Bank’s MPC committee voting to reduce the size of its bond-buying QE programme.  And today, ahead of his departure next month to run the Royal Society of Arts, he warns: Other Bank of England policymakers sound less concerned yesterday, Jonathan Haskel said he was “not that worried about inflation”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88d7ba77ab725910b33db3a917fd122dd327b186/0_273_3167_1901/master/3167.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d984bbc001c1a89fefdde08491b8aa88","title":"create a calm bedroom by making simple changes find the key to a good nights sleep","story":"We all know what it feels like to throw off the duvet in frustration and kick a leg out because we’ve got too hot under the cover. So, seeing as spring is all about fresh starts, how about a bedroom revamp with a focus on choosing some light, bright bedding for a more restful night’s sleep as the nights get warmer? When looking for new bedding, Marks \u0026amp Spencer is a good place to start. “We see ourselves as experts in sleep, so we are always looking for new products and innovations to bring to the market to help our customers get a great night’s sleep,” says Karen Thomas, head of design home and beauty at M\u0026ampS. “We see sleep health in the same way as we see physical health or dietary health, so a really important part of how we develop products is by solving sleep problems or sleep preferences with innovative new products that improve your sleep.” The M\u0026ampS Comfortably Cool range of filled bedding, sheets, duvet covers and mattress protectors use a Tencel-rich mix, which helps to keep your body temperature cool. Tencel is sustainably crafted from the eucalyptus tree and wicks moisture away from the skin, regulating your body temperature to give you a cool night’s sleep in luxurious comfort. If you are sweltering under your current duvet, it’s worth upgrading to one from the body sensor range of duvets, pillows and mattress protectors. These include specially developed technology to keep you warm when it’s cool and cool when it’s warm, while drawing moisture away from the body to create a drier environment for a more comfortable night’s sleep. And it’s not just about temperature. Getting the darkness levels in the room right is also key to a good night’s sleep. When it’s dark, our bodies release the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin, however, light interrupts its production, which signals to our bodies it’s time to wake up. Even the LED light from an alarm clock can affect your quality of sleep. Ideally you want your room to be so dark that you can’t see from one end to the other. Now the mornings are lighter, you may find yourself waking earlier than you need to, particularly if your blinds or curtains are thin or light-coloured. To ensure your room stays dark for the hours you are sleeping you should consider curtains with an extra blackout layer, such as M\u0026ampS’s cotton bee print curtains or fern pencil-pleat black out curtains. By buying curtains that are lined with a blackout material, you don’t have to limit your curtain choice to dark colours. The next important thing you can do to ease yourself into a good night’s sleep is to turn your bedroom into a haven. Create an environment you find restful and relaxing by clearing away clutter, removing blue-light emitting technology and choosing colours and patterns that lift your mood. Why not opt for some statement bed-linen in fashionable botanical prints, such as this palm-frond bedding set, or this bright jungle one. Leaf patterns bring some of that spring growth indoors and can help you to feel calm. “Creating a calm bedroom can be done by just making simple changes,” says Jaya Myra, a mind-body wellness expert and bestselling author. “Keep the space as clean and decluttered as possible. A bedroom that is too full of stuff – including furniture – does not contribute to good sleep or relaxed energy. Secondly, have at least three things out in the open in the bedroom that make you smile.” This can be as simple as a photograph, a book and fresh flowers. Scent can also have a calming effect and can set the scene for a restful night’s sleep. Lavender has long been known to have sleep-inducing properties and you will find this oil as well as eucalyptus, vetiver and jasmine in the sleep diffusers from M\u0026ampS’s Apothecary range. There are other sensory products in the range to make your room a scented sleep space, including the sleep room spray and the calm scented candle, which is crafted with sweet orange and lavender essential oils. And if it works for babies and toddlers, it can work for you: have a soak in a warm, scented bath to relax your body before bed. Stir in a handful of Tranquil bath salts from the Apothecary range, which contain hemp seed oil to aid relaxation and then, once your fingers begin to shrivel, dry yourself off with the softest Egyptian cotton towels. These towels bring the spa experience into your home and are available in a rainbow of colours, which won’t fade because they are treated with stay-new technology. Suitably cocooned, you can return to your revamped bedroom, certain of a good night’s sleep.

Especially when armed with budget-friendly homeware collections, such as the take on 2021’s biggest decor trends from Marks \u0026amp Spencer. “If you’re keen to refresh tired decor without creating too much work for yourself, the best place to start for a quick win is a fresh lick of paint,” says Alexandra Laird, interior design manager at the Burbeck Group. But you don’t have to stop there. “If replacing furniture is over budget, bright accessories and artwork can be easily added to a room to bring in some new colour.” “A key trend that’s easy to implement on a moderate budget right now would be a modern minimalist look with a Scandi furniture scheme. Use a neutral palette with pops of bright colour added through your furnishings and artwork throughout,” she adds. Make a start by lifting your living room with an emerald green sofa scattered with ochre cushions, or brighten up the bedroom by mixing soft grey bedding with rugs and throws in ocean blue and vibrant mustard. “Keep the rest of the room fairly neutral as a backdrop to really make your bold and bright colours sing,” says Kate Hatherell, founder of the Interior Designers Hub. A simple glass-topped coffee table, for example, is a perfect finisher – style and function without adding to the noise. If you’re looking for a softer palette that’ll calm, start with neutral colours to set the tone. This year’s shades – cream, grey, navy, duck egg, soft pink – all work well together and have the added benefit of timeless appeal. “A good way to add some warmth to neutral shades without disrupting that feeling of calm would be clever use of lighting,” says Laird. “Use table lamps and floor lamps in the corners of a room to add a cosy feel. I’d also bring in textured or warm coloured throws and cushions to maximise that feeling further. Again, you can play around with artwork and soft furnishings to add in warm colourings where needed.” Carry the same peaceful palette into the bedroom with a watercolour bedspread and crisp white linen. A top tip: natural wood accents complement almost all colour combos and, according to interior designer Katharine Pooley, also tick the box for this year’s rustic-inspired trend. “Embracing traditional interiors can help to create a comfortable atmosphere, even if your home is newly-built and therefore perhaps lacks more historical features,” she says. Try rustic-look furniture such as an oak-topped coffee table, or maximise the light with a metal lampshade. If the rustic look isn’t for you, how about heritage inspired classics reimagined for today? We’re talking modern use of colour, and striking scale and pattern. From Pinterest to the high street, you’ll see myriad nods to elegant florals, rich botanical prints, plush fabrics and plenty of polished glassware. Carrying on the taste for vintage twists, art deco references are also back on trend. Looking forward to inviting friends and family over for dinner again? Now’s the time to spruce up your glassware, or add an ornate mirrored tray to your drinks cabinet. Heading down the vintage decor route does come with a warning from the experts, however. “Be careful when working with vintage-inspired pieces that you don’t aim to simply reproduce the era,” says Pooley. Laird agrees that you’ll want to keep things on the right side of Gatsby-era with this trend. “The best way to stop the room from looking too old fashioned and keep it modern is to use contemporary key pieces of furniture, such as the sofa in the lounge, or the bedroom setup, and then add vintage-inspired lamps, accessories and artwork around this,” she advises. Nail it with tactile textures such as Egyptian cotton, luxury velvet and smooth sateen, and sprinkle in a few delightfully retro nods such as cotton velvet cushions, butterfly or hummingbird details and marble accents.

The challenge now is to extend those much loved interiors into the garden to create an exciting new living space. Somewhere to relax with family or entertain friends You don’t need a massive budget to create an outdoor area infused with your personality and taste. Whether you like the relaxed Scandi vibe with its casual blues palette or are aiming to be right on trend with up to the minute rich tropical mixes, we’ve got it covered. A great starting point is to choose outdoor furniture that is built to last, such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s new Porto furniture range. These durable sofas, chairs, stools and loungers are made with powder-coated metal frames to withstand the worst of the British weather and are finished with stylish wooden armrests and contemporary grey cushions. They provide the perfect neutral backdrop for you to add pops of colour to, such as these bright teal leaf-patterned outdoor cushions made from a water-resistant fabric that will withstand the occasional rain shower, or water fight. If you want to make a more bold colour statement, opt for furniture such as these bright yellow Lois garden armchairs, which will brighten a dull corner of any garden, or how about a raspberry coloured parasol, such as M\u0026ampS’s Shanghai parasol, which has UPF50+ protection from UV rays to ensure you can lounge without adding lines to your face. “Don’t be too heavy-handed with lots of contrasting blocks of colour though,” says London-based stylist Katie Cordell. “Carefully layering tones, with the odd bright zesty pop, will create a more harmonious space.” Once you have your furniture sorted, it’s time to add decorative detailing. Choose a mix of flowering and evergreen plants and shrubs to soften the space and add fragrant colour. Tall plants, such as bamboo, can be used to create a natural screen for your seating area, or you can use trellises with climbing plants such as honeysuckle or jasmine to provide shade and define the area. Choose pots and planters that match your cushions, such as this teal planter in the Lois collection, or opt for neutral greys, blacks and browns. If you find too many pots untidy, then you can build deep planters using railway sleepers or reclaimed bricks to give your outdoor living area a more walled-in feel. To extend the use of the space well into the evening you might want to add the Madeira fire pit, which has a mosaic border for a hint of the Mediterranean. You can then use lamps and lanterns to create ambient outdoor lighting, such as this quirky glass butterfly lantern, which takes a tea light, or this large wooden hurricane lantern, which will take a full-size candle. Consider buying candles that contain citronella to keep the bugs away. “Hanging small lanterns in shrubs or trees will create a magical, fairytale scene,” advises Cordell. Even with the fire pit lit, you might still want to provide some blankets for your guests to wrap themselves in if the night is chilly. These lightweight herringbone throws come in a variety of colours and can be draped over knees or wrapped around poncho style. Whether you opt for picnic-style cold nibbles, a classic barbecue feast, or sausages on sticks cooked on the fire, you will need some outdoor dinnerware to create a cheerful spread. M\u0026ampS’s rainbow picnic range is made out of clear plastic with a multi-coloured tint and even comes with a matching drinks dispenser that you can fill with punch or homemade lemonade. Alternatively go for bold and playful prints, such as these bamboo and melamine jungle dinner plates, which depict bright exotic scenes to make you feel as if you have travelled farther than your own back yard. “Or bring the jungle inside and mount these plates on the wall,” says Cordell. “They would make a fabulous addition to a child’s bedroom – all you need are some simple plate hangers to attach them with.” And, of course, not everyone has the luxury of having their own outdoor space, but there are plenty of other ways you can bring a hint of a garden into your home. You could plant some herbs in a window box to create a minute kitchen garden on your window sill, or buy some colourful geraniums to provide a potted, fragrant table display. If you don’t feel you’ve got green fingers, or don’t want the hassle of looking after living plants, you can opt for faux ones. Gone are the days when fake plants looked, well, fake. These days artificial plants are very convincing and can be a great solution for a room that doesn’t get much light, such as a north-facing bedroom or a hallway. This floor-standing artificial tropical plant is a real statement piece that would require heat and humidity were it real, but will merrily suffer draughts and drought in its artificial form. Consider contrasting plants that have soft, feathery leaves, such as ferns, with harsher, more angular plants, such as aloe. “A simple shelf filled with plants above your bed is an excellent way of bringing some greenery into your bedroom,” says Cordell. “These fake plants are ideal for a position where it’s harder to water.” Alternatively you can look to bring leaf prints into your soft furnishings, or even your wallpaper, to bring the mood-boosting power of plants into your home.

A total of 549 incorrect charges were identified, which were either withdrawn by prosecutors at the first court hearing or returned to the relevant CPS area to be set aside.  This included all 270 charges under the Coronavirus Act, under which the main criminal offence relates to potentially infectious persons who refuse to co-operate with the police or public health officers, when they are required to be screened for Covid-19. The regulations contain various criminal offences, which over the course of the pandemic have covered numerous restrictions – including on leaving home, social gatherings, self-isolation, travel and the wearing of face coverings. Of 1,551 prosecutions brought under the Regulations in the first year, just under two in 10 were incorrectly charged. The CPS said errors have typically involved wrong iterations of the rules, which have changed frequently, being used. Some cases were also discontinued due to insufficient evidence. Last month, MPs and peers on the joint committee on human rights said all Covid fines issued in England during the pandemic should be reviewed and no criminal record should result from Covid fixed penalty notices. It described the regulations as muddled, discriminatory and unfair. Gregor McGill, CPS Director of Legal Services, said:  Johnson said “we are ruling nothing out” and did not deny local lockdowns could return to clamp down on the variant spreading and threatening unlocking progress made by vaccines, which have so far been given to 35 million people (see earlier post). “There are a range of things we could do, we want to make sure we grip it,” Johnson told broadcasters in an interview on Thursday. My colleagues Aubrey Allegretti and Rachel Hall have the full story here: The age group with the highest rates was those aged 10 to 19, with 51.5 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 9 May, up week on week from 42.4, PA Media reports.The recovery will resemble a bouncing tennis ball and outpace the US and the rest of the G7 this year, said Andy Haldane, the central bank’s outgoing chief economist. Such is the strength of the likely turnaround from last year’s slump – the worst in 300 years after the pandemic first hit – that inflation could return with a vengeance, wreaking a 1970s-style surge in prices that could turn a boom into a bust. Phillip Inman, an economics writer for the , has the latest here: The Gulf state had banned the movement of people and vehicles between 7pm and 4am on 8 May. It had also prohibited commercial activity during the day, which will now be permitted, Reuters reports. New daily cases of the virus have risen in Oman since the start of the year, but in recent weeks have begun to fall. The vaccine is the fourth coronavirus vaccine approved so far in Thailand.

File photograph: Getty An Instagram for children platform would be akin to an “alcopop” used to recruit for future commercial gain, an Oireachtas committee has heard. Head of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC), John Church, was also critical of tech companies’ track record in balancing the needs of children with shareholder interests. He was addressing the Oireachtas Committee on Media during its pre-legislative scrutiny of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2020 and broader issues around children’s use of social media platforms. Asked about reports that Facebook was considering launching a version of its popular Instagram platform for users under the age of 13, Mr Church replied that “anything that’s set up directly at kids is almost like the alcopops for platforms. It’s just a form of a private platform trying to recruit for future sustenance.”Alex Cooney, chief executive of the CyberSafeKids charity, noted that Snapchat had a children’s version but that eight to 13-year-old children, in their experience, were more interested in the regular version used by their elder peers. Mr Church also expressed concerns over end-to-end encryption which he said was being planned by tech platforms in order to ensure user privacy. “That has an unwitting issue of actually protecting perpetrators online as well with the online trading, which is a terrible term to use, but it’s a big business, online trading of child sexual abuse materials,” he said.“We landed a helicopter on Mars, surely we can actually protect children at the same time as providing privacy.” He was critical of tech companies’ progress in tackling child safety procedures and raised the issue of balancing shareholder values with safeguarding children.Are the restrictions working?Asked by Sinn Féin TD Imelda Munster about the age of people signing up for social media accounts, Ms Cooney replied that while minimum ages are generally between 13 and 16, they were aware of “quite some numbers” of children aged eight and nine. “Clearly the restrictions that are in place do not work,” she said. “That’s something that we need to look at and it may be that we could look at other ways around this without, what we don’t want is that children have to hand over more of their data in order to determine their age.” Ms Cooney said a possible solution would be the scanning of data for verification that is immediately deleted. In its submission to the committee CyberSafeKids argued that the forthcoming legislation on internet safety must “explicitly name” an online safety commissioner in order to make the creation of such a post “clear and specific”, a point echoed by others during the proceedings. It also said the Bill is lacking in addressing the need for a strong inidual complaints mechanism. The Children’s Right Alliance similarly criticised the scheme of the Bill for not specifically stating that an online safety commissioner would be nominated from an overall media commission.The ISPCC noted a recent study by the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at Dublin City University that found 28 per cent of children surveyed reported being victims of cyberbullying during the recent lockdown."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Dublin Climate Dialogues will produce recommendations for UK, host of COP26Europe Letter: More than 50 green laws and reforms on EU schedule in next 18 months"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe .Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has described Tánaiste Leo Varadkar’s comments on the numbers who could be vaccinated by June as “very ambitious”.Mr Varadkar, according to sources present, told Wednesday’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting that everyone who wants a Covid-19 vaccine appointment could be offered one by the end of June. His expectation was based on a view that around 15 per cent of the population would not seek a jab. Asked about the report on Thursday, Mr Donnelly said he hoped the Government could “deliver on that”. “If the vaccines that have been ordered are delivered on time then by June four out of every five people who were entitled to the vaccine will have been vaccinated. The latest analysis of figures was that everyone would have been vaccinated by September,” he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny programme. The Government has set a target of offering or administering a vaccine to 82 per cent of the population by the end of June. As of Monday, some 35.2 per cent (1.37 million) of people aged over 16 had received a first shot, with more than 506,000 people having received both. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he had been told by the HSE that the State was likely to pass the mark of 2 million vaccines being administered today. “Another important milestone in our rollout – and tribute to the dedication of vaccines teams up and down the country,” he said in a Twitter post.A further eight Covid-19 related deaths and 448 cases were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Wednesday. The number of people in hospital with the disease is down to 111 with 34 being treated in intensive care units. Incidence ratesThe latest figures show that Donegal, which had the highest incidence of the disease in the State for some time, has been overtaken by Kildare as the county with the highest number of new cases per capita. The 14-day incidence rate in Kildare stands at 251.7 infections per 100,000 people, which is almost double the national average of 129.7. Donegal has the second highest rate at 240.6 followed by Dublin at 198.2Mr Donnelly said the response from local communities in Donegal had been “strong” and that indicators suggested the rate of infection would continue to fall there. He also paid tribute to all members of the Oireachtas for their response to the pandemic. Although there were some who were “hedging their bets”, he said he appreciated the support of colleagues from across the political spectrum.On the issue of differing responses by hospital maternity units to allowing partners attending ante-natal appointments and be present in labour wards, the Minister said 14 of the 19 maternity units in the country were complying with the instruction that partners should be allow attend, but there were five units were local reasons meant that such facilities could not be allowed.Safety firstThese were in Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, St Luke’s in Kilkenny and Letterkenny. He safety should come first, he said.He also defended his position on antigen testing and denied that he was supporting the sale of them while dismissing their efficacy. He said rapid testing had a role to play in emerging from Covid-19 restrictions. “I’m not saying they are useless,” he said of the tests, the sale of which in supermarkets has been criticised by some Nphet members. However, Mr Donnelly pointed out that while there was a danger that people with a negative result would think they were not infectious, if the test results were positive then antigen testing could prevent super spreader events.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"who and global leaders could have averted covid calamity experts say","story":"A family member carries a patient who is having difficulty in breathing, to a free oxygen support centre being run by a Gurudwara, a place of worship for Sikhs,  on the outskirts of New Delhi on Monday. Photograph:  Arun SankarAFP via Getty ImagesA swift and collaborative international response could have stopped the 2019 Covid-19 outbreak in China becoming a global catastrophe in 2020, according to a scathing report on the response of world leaders and the World Health Organisation to the pandemic.An expert review by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, commissioned by the WHO, sets out lessons for preventing future pandemics and makes dozens of recommendations for reform.They include a new treaty setting up a Global Health Threats Council, more surveillance power for the WHO to investigate and publish information about disease outbreaks without the approval of governments, and new funding for an International Pandemic Financing Facility (IPFF) that could spend $5 billion-$10 billion (€4.1 billion-€8.2 billion) a year on preparedness and call on $50 billion-$100 billion at short notice in a health emergency.“The panel is recommending a fundamental transformation designed to ensure commitment at the highest level to a new system ... on which citizens can rely to keep them safe and healthy,” said its co-chairs, former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former president of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.The review does not examine the origins of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. But it criticises the Chinese authorities and WHO for being too slow to recognise that the virus was spreading between people in Wuhan and then to warn the world about human to human transmission.“For the future, a precautionary approach should be used from the outset, acknowledging that a respiratory disease may spread from person to person unless and until established otherwise,” the report says.“If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly and more widely, that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the virus,” Clark told a press briefing ahead of the review’s publication. “We have to realise that we are living in the 21st century and not in medieval times.”The panel criticises the WHO for not declaring Covid a public health emergency of international concern until January 30th. It was officially called a pandemic on March 11th.But the strongest criticism was directed at the wealthy nations of Europe and North America for “wasting February 2020” through inaction – leading to “a lost month when many more countries could have taken steps to contain the spread of Sars-Cov-2 and forestall the global health, social and economic catastrophe that continues its grip”.When the gravity of the crisis was finally acknowledged in March 2020, “there was a mad scramble for PPE, therapeutics and other equipment”, said Clark. “This was compounded by a lack of global leadership.”To provide leadership in future, the panel calls on the world’s heads of government to set up a Global Health Threats Council and a Pandemic Framework Convention to provide a stronger legal foundation for action. It recommends these are launched at a global summit, a special session of the United Nations General Assembly that should be convened for the purpose later this year.WHO financingThe council would allocate funds from the IPFF to institutions developing preparedness and response capabilities, including a global platform capable of delivering vaccines, diagnostics, drugs and supplies “swiftly and equitably worldwide – shifting from a market model to one aimed at delivering global public goods”. The facility should be ready to disburse up to $100 billion at short notice in the event of another pandemic, the panel says.The review also calls for the authority and financing of the WHO to be strengthened. This would involve increasing the fees paid by member states “depoliticising recruitment (especially at senior levels) by adhering to criteria of merit and relevant competencies” improving the performance of its board – which the panel says failed to perform as an executive body during the pandemic – and appointing a director-general with a single seven-year term of office rather than the current renewable five-year terms.Panel members are talking to heads of government to ensure the measures are implemented. “The shelves of storage rooms in the UN and national capitals are full of reports and reviews of previous health crises,” Sirleaf said. “Had their warnings been heeded, we would have avoided the catastrophe we are in today.

There is concern about a possible flu epidemic since the historically low rates of the disease over the past 12 months make vaccines harder to adapt.A perfectly legitimate case can be made for not having this type of inquiry at all but since Mr Johnson would have been hounded until he agreed, it was pointless to resist. However, it will last for years, whereas the lessons from the pandemic need to be learned now. Many of them are already apparent. The World Health Organisation’s panel of independent experts and senior political figures, which has reported within just a few months, set out just a few of them yesterday.We know all of this without the need for a public inquiry. As to the actions of the British Government, several parliamentary committees have taken extensive evidence from senior Government advisers and Sage scientists while auditors have looked into the speed, cost and propriety of the procurement process. Again, what has been learned must be taken on board now and not await the outcome of a public inquiry. We may have to deal with another epidemic before it reports.The inquiry chairman has yet to be appointed and the terms of reference are still to be announced. The former is likely to be a judge and the latter must range more widely than public health matters. A sterile argument over whether the country should have locked down a week or two before it did will help no one, but is likely to be the conclusion sought by Mr Johnson’s opponents.Given what has happened, it is evident that the strategy for dealing with a pandemic was flawed and the shortcomings need to be put right now. But what was not planned for at all was the impact of the lockdowns. No government had ever contemplated such action and everything – from the unprecedented restrictions on personal freedoms to the massive cost of underpinning the economy – had to be made up on the spot.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality

“Indian Room” to avoid causing controversy with colonial links in a new Winston Churchill exhibition.An exhibition titled Greatest Briton at the wartime leader’s Oxfordshire birthplace will detail his life story with displays throughout the 18th-century stately home, including in the property’s Indian Room named for its Raj-themed wallpaper.Churchill’s legacy has been scrutinised after Black Lives Matter protests saw his Parliament Square statue daubed with the word “racist” last year, and the National Trust promised to address his alleged role in the Bengal Famine which left up to three million Indians dead.Blenheim Palace bosses have now changed the name of the home’s Indian Room to the “Summer Terrace Room” to remove any colonial connotations in the exhibition on the former Prime Minister.“We didn’t want to provoke controversy,” operations director Heather Carter told The Daily .“We have changed the name of the room.  It’s not the Indian Room, it’s now the Summer Terrace Room.  It’s about making it more accessible.”The Indian Room’s wallpaper has depicted a tiger hunt since first being commissioned by George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough, in 1826, but the suite overlooking the gardens was likely called the Summer Terrace Room during Churchill’s lifetime.It will be used as part of a child-friendly exhibition on the two-time Prime Minister, with accessibility for a broad audience in mind, rather than the historical reckoning promised at other historic sites.The National Trust last year unveiled a dossier of research into alleged colonial connections at Churchill\u0027s Chartwell home in Kent, noting that “he was prime minister during the devastating Bengal famine of 1943”.Academics convened at the eponymous Churchill College Cambridge, named in his honour, alleged he was complicit in the famine, as well claiming he was a “white supremacist” and “worse than the Nazis”.But, despite changing the name of the Indian Room, Churchill\u0027s ancestral home will break ranks with the revisionism of other institutions by framing the politician as a wartime hero.Ms Carter said:  “We don’t touch on the controversy.  We feel that that is not our story to tell.“We are aware of the debate about his life and legacy, but that is for others to tell.“We don\u0027t go deeply into all the politics and the controversy.“He won a great war, he was a hero.  That is how we see him.  This is a celebration.”The exhibition will offer a personal history of the leader and his links to Blenheim, making use of props including waxwork sculpture of the Prime Minister, and a tent similar to the one he would have used during the Boer War.The visual rather than text-led exhibition has been devised to attract visitors to the stately home beyond avid historians and fans of Churchill, Ms Carter said.In 1874, the wartime leader was born on the estate which was a gift to his ancestor General John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, for his victory at Blenheim during the War of the Spanish Succession.The stately home remained a destination for Churchill during school holidays and later for house parties, and the family history connected to the house was an inspiration for both his historical writing and his wartime strategy.Blenheim Palace’s Emily Hirons said:  “The Palace and the estate was one of his most cherished places and he returned here again and again throughout his long life.”New displays will be open to visitors from May 17. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and

myanmar beauty queen joins armed struggle against junta","story":"A former Myanmar beauty queen has joined the ranks of ethnic insurgents opposing the ruling junta, posting photos of herself on Facebook in a jungle setting with an assault rifle. A military takeover and the ousting of the civilian government on February 1 plunged the Southeast Asian country into crisis, and close to 800 people have been killed by security forces in a violent post-coup crackdown. Today marks 100 days since we lost everything, wrote Htar Htet Htet, 32, in her social media post. “The time has come to fight back.”The coup ended the country\u0027s decade-long experiment with democracy after half a century of military rule.There have been several reports of young activists fleeing a military manhunt and taking refuge in the restive border homelands of Myanmar’s ethnic minorities. Others are believed to have chosen voluntarily to take up arms training alongside rebels who have waged insurgencies against the military for decades as they seek to secure more autonomy for their communities. In 2013, Htar Htet Htet represented Myanmar in the first Miss Grand International beauty pageant in Thailand.Before swapping into black combat fatigues, and heading to the jungle, she also worked as a gymnastics instructor. “I will fight back as much as I can. I am ready and prepared to give up everything. I am even ready to pay with my life,” she wrote. Anti-coup street protests are continuing across Myanmar, despite the risk of injury or death at the hands of junta forces. The civil disobedience movement, which has seen many workers in multiple professions strike against the military regime, is also ongoing. More than 11,000 academics and other university staff opposed to the junta have been suspended after going on strike in protest against military rule, a teachers\u0027 group said this week. The suspensions come as the resumption of universities after a year closed due to the coronavirus epidemic prompts a new confrontation between the army and the staff and students, who are calling for boycotts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel military draws plan ground invasion gaza","story":"The Israeli military was drawing up plans to send troops into Gaza on Thursday as it continued to exchange fire with Hamas fighters through the night, while in Israeli cities a fresh wave of riots led to 400 arrests.The Israeli Defense Forces said it had deployed two infantry units and one armoured unit to the border with Gaza, and that a ground operations plan would be submitted to military chiefs later today, ahead of approval by the Israeli government. The decision on whether to invade Gaza is up to the Israeli government, rather than the military, and it carries significant political implications for the cabinet as it would substantially increase the risk of far more Israeli casualties.Hamas has said it fired a large rocket at Israel\u0027s Ramon airport near Eilat, where incoming passenger flights were erted after waves of rocket launches towards the main airport near Tel Aviv.A spokesman for Hamas\u0027 armed wing announced the launch of the 250 kilogram (550 pound) rocket and demanded that all international airlines immediately halt their flights to any airports in the Jewish state.Despite diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis, which US President Joe Biden said he hoped would end sooner than later, hundreds of rockets flew across the Gaza Strip overnight.James Cleverly, the UK Middle East minister, described the level of rocket fire from Gaza into Israel as unprecedented, and called on all sides to step back from the brink.Air raid warnings went off across Israel, including for the first time in the country\u0027s north, though on Thursday an Israeli military spokesman said this had been a false alarm. Israel\u0027s air force said it had launched multiple strikes, targeting what it described as locations linked to the counterintelligence infrastructure of Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, as well as the house of Iyad Tayeb, one of the movement\u0027s commanders.There were reports from Gaza on Thursday that Israel had struck a Hamas-controlled ministry of finance building as well as a Hamas-controlled bank. IDF strikes also destroyed a multi-storey tower housing Palestinian television channel Al-Aqsa, which was set up by Hamas.It\u0027s the same atmosphere of 2014, Saud Abu Ramadan, a freelance journalist in Gaza City, said.He was referring to the bloody 7-week war that followed the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas members. Over 2,000 Palestinians and widespread destruction was inflicted on Gaza\u0027s infrastructure. Warplanes are buzzing, and people are just trying to keep their heads down,” he added.Israel meanwhile announced that Palestinian militants had launched around 1,600 rockets into its territory since Monday evening.Many in Israel also holed up in shelters as waves of rockets hit its heartland, some blown out of the sky by Iron Dome interceptors.All of Israel is under attack. It\u0027s a very scary situation to be in, said Margo Aronovic, a 26-year-old student, in Tel Aviv.We\u0027re coping, sitting at home, hoping it will be OK, said Motti Haim, a resident of the central town of Beer Yaakov and father of two children. It\u0027s not simple running to the shelter. It\u0027s not easy with the kids.In Gaza, 83 people have so far been killed, the health ministry controlled by the territory\u0027s Islamist rulers Hamas said Thursday.The dead included 17 children, while 487 people have been wounded, the ministry said.In Israel, the casualty rate has risen to seven following the death of an Israeli soldier and a five-year-old boy who was killed by rocket fire. On Wednesday, Hamas announced the death of its military chief in Gaza City, Bassem Issa, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) saying they had killed several other senior Hamas figures as well.Health authorities in Gaza said they were investigating the deaths of several people overnight who they said may have inhaled poisonous gas. Samples were being examined and they had yet to draw any final conclusions, they said.There were 400 arrests across Israeli cities such as Acre, Haifa and Lod overnight in what the president of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, described as a civil war between Arab and Jewish residents. Israeli TV footage showed Jewish rioters pulling an Arab man from his car and beating him severely, in what was described as a lynching. In the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Lod, Arab rioters torched cars, a school and a synagogue. Israeli police said two people were shot and wounded in Lod and an Israeli Jew was stabbed.Mr Rivlin, in unusually strong language, denounced what he described as a pogrom in which an incited and bloodthirsty Arab mob had injured people and attacked sacred Jewish spaces.In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian man was killed during a confrontation with Israeli soldiers near the northern city of Nablus, the Palestinian health ministry said Thursday.What has been happening these last few days in Israeli towns is unacceptable... Nothing justifies the lynching of Arabs by Jews and nothing justifies the lynching of Jews by Arabs, Mr Netanyahu said, adding that Israel was fighting a battle on two fronts.While United Nations and Egyptian officials have said that cease-fire efforts are underway, there were no signs of progress on Thursday.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the indiscriminate launching of rockets from civilian areas in Gaza toward Israeli population centers, but he also urged Israel to show maximum restraint.Israel echoed the UN\u0027s sentiments in a letter to Mr Guterres.I call upon the international community to unequivocally condemn the indiscriminate attacks by terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip against Israeli civilians and population centers and to support Israel\u0027s fundamental right to self-defense, the country\u0027s ambassador to the UN and to the US, Gilad Erdan, said in the letter.The State of Israel is not interested in an escalation. However, Israel has the right and duty to defend its people and sovereignty and will continue to do so vigorously, he added.Amid fears the violence could spiral further out of control, Washington planned to send an envoy, Hady Amr, for talks with Israel and Palestinians.My expectation and hope is this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself, Mr Biden said on Wednesday.Mr Cleverly, Britain\u0027s minister for the Middle East, called on Hamas, Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink of what he cast as a terrible escalation, and told the Islamist group to cease rocket attacks on the Jewish state.It is important for both sides to take a step back, Mr Cleverly told Sky News.We have seen, however, an unprecedented level of rocket attack into Israel, he said. We want to see the rocket attacks stop.British Airways cancelled its flights to and from Tel Aviv on Thursday, the latest international carrier to avoid flying to Israel.The safety and security of our colleagues and customers is always our top priority, and we continue to monitor the situation closely, British Airways said.United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines on Wednesday all cancelled flights between the United States and Tel Aviv. Lufthansa follows on Thursday.Incoming flights from Ben Gurion International Airport have been erted to the Ramon airfield in the country\u0027s far south, Israel\u0027s Transportation Ministry said. The airfield was designed to serve as a wartime alternative to its main international gateway outside Tel Aviv.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"now moment shakeup unionism northern ireland","story":"Northern Ireland’s biggest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), was already embroiled in its first competitive leadership battle, after elected representatives ousted Arlene Foster. Now, the province’s second biggest unionist party, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), is seeking a new leader too, following the resignation of Steve Aiken, a former Royal Navy submarine commander who was in post for just eighteen months.Foster’s overthrow was an acrimonious affair and she has since announced that she intends to leave the DUP when she stands down officially. In contrast, according to the UUP at least, Aiken left after “long conversations” about the future of the party that took place “face to face”. His potential successor, Doug Beattie, said “He made the decision himself. It was his decision to take.”Aiken’s departure seemed to be an amicable affair, but it was prompted, at least in part, by the DUP’s move against Foster. The UUP dominated politics in Northern Ireland until the early 2000s and, since then, it has been desperate to regain control of unionism. In theory, the DUP’s messy coup against its leader and the secretive leadership contest that ensued provided the Ulster Unionists’ with an ideal opportunity.At the same time, the party’s electoral performances under Aiken were among the worst in its history and there was little confidence that he could inspire a ‘surge’ to challenge its rivals. Recent polling suggested the DUP was losing supporters to the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which opposes power-sharing with Sinn Fein, and the Alliance Party, which claims it is ‘agnostic’ on the Union, instead of the UUP.When the DUP’s elected representatives challenged Foster to hold a leadership contest and she resigned, it looked like the party would see a resurgence of hardline, religious conservatives, in the mould of Ian Paisley. It was unclear whether the coup was inspired chiefly by political disagreements, policy differences or factionalism, but it added urgency to the Ulster Unionists’ deliberations about their leadership.The DUP must now choose between the Stormont MLA Edwin Poots, a member of Paisley’s evangelical Free Presbyterian sect, who is cast as the traditionalist candidate, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP, who defected from the UUP and is viewed as a moderniser. The competitors are not allowed to speak to the media while the contest is ongoing, so their campaign teams have communicated their plans to the public via anonymous briefings.The Ulster Unionists are keen for their selection process to look transparent in comparison. Steve Aiken spoke at length to the media, explaining how he sees the party’s future, and Doug Beattie, who is, as yet, the only declared candidate, was interviewed on the BBC’s Nolan Show. Beattie is a former army captain, who was awarded a Military Cross for his bravery in Afghanistan. He is viewed as relatively liberal and may be well placed to win votes back from the self-styled ‘progressives’ of the Alliance Party, as well as disillusioned DUP supporters. The challenge, for any Ulster Unionist leader, though, will be to explain clearly what the party stands for. In recent decades, it struggled to persuade voters that it was significantly different from the DUP.Perhaps the key for the party is not to concentrate exclusively on the ide that separates socially liberal and conservative voters in Ulster. There are equally important differences between unionists who want to play a full role in the UK and those who like the trappings of Britishness but are comfortable seeing Northern Ireland as a ‘place apart’ from the rest of the country.The Northern Ireland Protocol is compelling proof that this ‘Ulster nationalist’ attitude makes it easier for Westminster governments to distance the province from mainstream politics. Ulster badly needs a unionist party that is comfortable with the modern world, but remains firm on constitutional issues and makes the integrity of the UK its primary focus. Some commentators claim that Northern Irish unionism is in turmoil, as both of its main parties struggle to appoint leaders to improve their image and boost their electoral performances. It’s important to recognise that unionists also have a valuable opportunity to become more appealing to modern voters and secure the Union into the future.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tricky topic lady kitty spencer thorny issue inheritance althorp","story":"Lady Kitty Spencer has said that attitudes to primogeniture are changing, despite her father’s insistence that she will not inherit Althorp.Earl Spencer, brother to Diana, Princess of Wales, plans to leave the estate to his son, Louis, who will inherit the title despite having three older sisters.The eldest is Lady Kitty, 30, who suggested that her father’s decision was out of step with modern thinking.“Primogeniture can be a tricky topic, because as times are changing, attitudes are as well. We’ve grown up understanding that it’s Louis to inherit, and Louis will do an incredible job,” she told Town \u0026amp Country magazine.Lady Kitty’s comments are the latest contribution to the debate over female heirs. In 2011, the 300-year-old rules of succession to the throne were changed to give equal rights to sons and daughters of any future British monarch. Had the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge been a girl, she would have grown up to become Queen.David Cameron, then Prime Minister, said at the time that “the idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man, just isn’t acceptable any more”.Nevertheless, in 2015 Earl Spencer confirmed that he would be sticking with tradition.“If I chose Kitty it would be against all the tradition that goes with Althorp. It’s just the way it is. I get the problems with it as a concept,” he said.“I also get the strengths of it having worked to date. It is still intact. If you go around the chateaux of the Loire or whatever, they are empty. Everything gets split equally through the generations and you end up with a beautiful building with one nice tapestry in it. The whole idea of primogeniture was to keep it together.”Lady Kitty spoke fondly of Althorp, the 90-room house in Northamptonshire that has been the seat of the Spencer family for 19 generations.“We have such an emotional attachment to Althorp. That’s where we would have our Easter egg hunts and our Christmases I have my little vegetable patch, I learnt to ride a horse there, I learnt to ride a bike and to rollerblade. It’s so lovely to look back on the history and think everybody else probably learnt to ride a horse there too.”Critics of the primogeniture system include Lady Kinvara Balfour, who called the system “archaic” and “absolutely mad”, saying it sent a message that “a daughter is a disappointment” and women are second best.Her mother, Lady Tessa, was the eldest child of the 17th Duke of Norfolk but the title and Arundel Castle in West Sussex went to Lady Tessa’s younger brother.For the magazine photoshoot, Lady Kitty, a model and ambassador for Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, posed in the grounds of Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, rather than Althorp.She also recalled being thrust into the spotlight when she attended the wedding of her cousin, the Duke of Sussex. Overnight, her Instagram following leapt from 37,000 to half a million.“I woke up the next day and looked at my phone and thought, ‘Whoops, did I take someone else’s by mistake?’ It was very weird and a little overwhelming.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch nicola sturgeons back and forth indyref2 messaging matters","story":"After the election, Nicola Sturgeon told Boris Johnson her plan for a second independence referendum was now a matter of when, not if, despite the SNP falling short of a majority.However, throughout the campaign for the May 6 election, there were varied messages from the SNP on what a vote for them meant.Sometimes it meant independence, other times it meant backing Ms Sturgeon\u0027s handling of the Covid pandemic recovery.

And he said he didnapost know why he signed off his texts Love DC - but admitted he did so with anyone he knew even at all well. The former Prime Minister was grilled by a Commons committee about his lobbying of ministers on behalf of the now-collapsed financial firm. He admitted: I was paid a generous amount - far more than I was paid as PM. And I had shares - not share options, but shares in the business which vested over the period of time of my contract. So itaposs important for the committee to know that I absolutely had a big economic investment in Greensill. I wanted it to succeed. I wanted it to grow. I havenapost put a number on those things, because ...the amount isnapost particularly germaine to these questions and is a private matter. But the ex-PM insisted his motivation for calls and texts to ministers asking for help on behalf of the firm was not just financial, but because he thought the firm had solutions that were in the interests of the public good.  Asked why he signed off some texts to officials with love DC - the ex-PM said: Anyone I know even at all well I tend to sign off with text messages aposlove DCapos, I don’t know why, I just do. My children say you don’t need to sign off text messages at all. Mr Cameron said he said abided by the rules that were in place, but added: Rules alone are never enough. We learnt that in this place over so many issues, personal conduct and codes of behaviour, and how such conduct and behaviour both appears and can be perceived, these things matter too. I completely accept that former prime ministers are in a dferent position to others because of the office that we held and the influence that continues to bring. We need to think dferently and act dferently. He said lobbying the Government was never intended to be part of his role at Greensill Capital until the coronavirus crisis.In his opening statement to the Commons Treasury Committee, he said: In terms of my role, I was not employed at Greensill as a lobbyist and lobbying the UK Government was never intended to be part of my role. However, in the economic turmoil caused by Covid, the Government, quite rightly, introduced several schemes to help ensure that credit would continue to be expanded to business. The Greensill proposal was to make this even more effective and I believed that it should be considered by Government.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDavid CameronPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"sage urgent meeting today indian","story":"NewsSAGE in urgent meeting today on Indian iant as expert warns it will get everywhereThe governments advisors are said to be meeting today amid fears new figures will show the B.. iant has tripled for the second week in a rowmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-headlines--emergency-sage-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:eeeffafbbffe,sourceUrl:trending,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:SKFVz,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

A member of the committee claimed “a delay is possible” to the final phase of lockdown easing in England - which is meant to abolish all legal social distancing rules from June . SAGE meet regularly. Boris Johnson today admitted “we are anxious about it - it has been spreading”.Read an updated version of this story here. The PM said “we’re ruling nothing out” and “there are meetings going on today to consider exactly what we need to do.” The PM insisted “at the moment I can see nothing that dissuades me” from thinking the final stage of ending lockdown rules can happen on June . But he suggested theto “normality” could slip to a later datethe Indian iant “takes off”. Askedmasks and social distancing were going, Boris Johnson said more announcements will be made before the end of the month. He added: I think we have to wait a little bit longer to see how the data is looking but I am cautiously optimistic about that. “Provided this Indian iant doesnapost take off in the way some people fear, I think certainly things could get back much, much closer to normality.” But Tory minister James Cleverly today refused to rule out delaying the end of lockdown beyond June .  Mr Cleverly also refused to rule out the prospect of local lockdowns in areas like Bolton, where the iant is believed to be spreading.But one expert today warned the spread of the coronavirus Indian iant should be viewed as a nationwide problem.Professor James Naismith, from the University of Oxford, said the iant may spread way beyond the local areas where it has been detected. Prof Naismith, who is also a director at the Rosalind Franklin Institute, said: I think we should view it as a country-wide problem. It will get everywhere. We keep learning this lesson, but we know that this will be the case.  Prof Naismith said he did not believe local restrictions would work to contain the iant. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: When we tried locally having dferent restrictions in dferent regions that didnapost really make any dference. So I donapost think thinking about a localised strategy for containment will really work. He added: The vaccines donapost % prevent infection for people. What they do, is they almost % prevent hospitalisation and serious illness. We donapost know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that. So even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection. And the very, very large number of cases in India mean things that are rare will be detected. Boris Johnson is expected to be asked for more details of the Covid- public inquiry when he faces the TV cameras.The Prime Minister is due to visit a school in Co Durham where he is set to face questions over why the probe will not be launched until next spring.

The case for an independent examination of how ministers, scientists and the NHS responded to the biggest public health ­emergency for a century was incontrovertible. We need to know why Britain ended up having one of the highest death tolls in the world, why the NHS was not prepared for such a crisis, why it took so long to provide PPE. Those who have lost loved ones to the virus are rightly furious the Prime Minister has delayed this inquiry until the spring of . If there is, as Mr Johnson has suggested, a strong likelihood of a winter surge then we should have at least an interim investigation now so lessons can be learned which may help prevent further deaths. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  By deferring the inquiry for a year the Prime Minister has clearly calculated the findings will not be published until after the next election. Not for the first time he’s putting his personal interests before those of the country. Fears of war There are concerns the violence in Jerusalem and Gaza could escalate into war. The Israeli military has responded to rocket attacks by Palestinian militants by unleashing a wave of air strikes.  Brokering a ceasefire is imperative and urgentwe are to prevent the loss of more civilian lives and stop the situation descending into a conflict which risks engulfing other parts of the Middle East. The international community must exert whatever influence it has on the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Then work must once again begin trying to find a lasting settlement based on the two-state solution. Pay a flat fee  Despite earning £, a year it appears Boris Johnson has trouble paying some of his bills on time.

Kamran Khan was racing his RS at more than mph over the limit when he collided with another car, which smashed into a church. More than a dozen people were injured in the terrying incident in Leeds in , including five children. Khan, , was arrested and pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was jailed for three years during a sentencing hearing at Leeds crown court earlier this month. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.  The court was told that Khan was driving his powerful vehicle - capable of speeds of up to mph - in wet conditions on a busy road. He then lost control and collided at speed with a Peugeot , which smashed into a Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. This vehicle hit several people, including a baby in a pram - which was trapped between the car and a wall. Most of the injuries were minor but one woman suffered a serious injury to the foot, the court was told.

PC Steve Harrison, of West Yorkshire Policeaposs Roads Policing Unit, spoke after the hearing. He said: While sentencing him, Judge Mairs repeatedly talked about Khan’s flagrant disregard for traffic laws. On that rainy day back in September , Khan chose to drive over twice the speed limit and caused a crash which injured multiple adults and children. It is sheer luck that only two people were seriously injured and that the consequences were not even more serious. The court were told Khan had a previous conviction for a drug driving offence and had cannabis in his system at the time of this collision. Khan has been jailed for his actions and I hope this sends a clear message of the dangers and consequences of driving at excessive speeds whilst under the influence of drugs.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPeugeotWest Yorkshire PoliceCCTVCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtPrison sentenceDriving banDangerous driving"},{"url":null,"title":"junk food advert ban fat","story":"NewsopinionJunk food advert ban is a fat lot of good for our children without cheaper fresh foodTo win the obesity battle we need better education and pricing in the shops, Mirror columnist and guilty mum Eva Simpson arguesmirrorShareCommentsByEva Simpson:,  MAY NewsopinionKids paying the price for junk food being cheap as chips \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Commercials featuring unhealthy food and snacks will no longer be shown pre-watershed and banished on the internet. It’s a signicant step, but much more needs to be donewe are to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis. Six out of  adults are overweight. The problem is particularly worrying for children. One in three leaves primary school overweight or obese. What’s really concerning is that when it comes to the bad stuff – sugar and fat – most of it is eaten at home. According to research from the ­University of Birmingham this week, ­children consume most sugar in meals prepared by their own parents. Researchers found that kids were having as much as  teaspoons of sugar every day – the equivalent of grams – which is added to food or drink or found naturally in fruit juices and honey. Cereal is one of the worst offenders. When I checked the sugar content of the cereal in my cupboard at home, I couldn’t believe I’d been buying breakfast food that contained almost  grams, the equivalent of three teaspoons of sugar, in a g serving. And let’s face it, we often eat more than g. It was a timely reminder that parents have to keep an eye on these things. It’s no good me giving my son fruit and a wholemeal cheese sandwich for lunchhe’s consuming half his sugar intake before he’s even got to school. I do think manufacturers have a key role to play. They must reduce the amount of sugar and, for that matter, salt, in food. No one needs that much. It also needs to be more affordable for parents to make nutritious meals from scratch at home. We’re constantly being told to eat more fresh fish and vegetables, for instance, but they often come with a hefty price tag compared to cheap and cheerful processed meals. Schools seem to have done a great job on this front. We no doubt have Jamie Oliver to thank for his war on Turkey Twizzlers, once a staple part of school dinners. Let’s have more education and make it easier and more affordable for families to eat well. Otherwise the tag of being the unhealthiest nation in Europe will be something we wear for a long time to come.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnFoodDietObesity"},{"url":null,"title":"madeleine mccann parents 18th birthday","story":"NewsMadeleine McCann parents th birthday message as they leave gts in untouched roomKate and Gerry McCann still leave gts and cards in Madeleines untouched bedroom and, on her th birthday today told their daughter we love you and are waiting for youmirrorShareByMartin Fricker:,  MAY NewsMadeleine McCann turned  on Wednesday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Kate and Gerry McCann still hope she will be found alive,  years after she vanished on holiday in Portugal in , days before her fourth birthday. They said in a poignant message: “We love you and are waiting for you.” Devoted Kate and Gerry marked daughter Madeleine’s th birthday on Wednesday by leaving cards and gts in her room, untouched since she vanished  years ago. The couple posted a photo of her on the Find Madeleine campaign Facebook page, writing alongside it: “Happy th birthday Madeleine.  “We love you and we’re waiting for you and we’re never going to give up.” Kate, , and Gerry, , had asked pals to mark the day in a low-key manner. The Facebook post came a week after they marked the “particularly poignant” th anniversary of her disappearance. Madeleine went missing from her family’s holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz days before her fourth birthday in May .  Prosecutors want to question German paedophile Christian Brueckner over her disappearance and claim to have evidence that she is dead. But Kate and Gerry, , of Rothley, Leics, refuse to give up hope that Madeleine is still alive and will one day be found. In another post on the Find Madeleine page last week they said they “need to know what happened to our lovely daughter”. Scotland Yard’s hunt for Madeleine’s abductor continues, with four detectives still working on Operation Grange.  A top-level summit between German, British and Portuguese detectives is due to take place in Lisbon this summer. The Mirror revealed in January that cops are launching a push to find the “missing piece of the jigsaw” that could snare Brueckner. German and Portuguese investigators are to carry out new interviews of key witnesses in the Algarve who knew him. Brueckner, , was named as the prime suspect for Madeleine’s disappearance by German prosecutors last June.  They believe he abducted and killed the three-year-old. He is currently serving a seven-year term in a prison in Hanover for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in . His lawyer Friedrich Fulscher insists the German has nothing to do with the youngster’s disappearance. Last week the couple posted on Facebook: “Every May is tough – a reminder of years passed, of years together lost, or stolen.  “This year it is particularly poignant as we should be celebrating Madeleine’s th birthday. Enough said. “The Covid pandemic has made this year even more dficult for many reasons but thankfully the investigation to find Madeleine and her abductor has continued. “We hang on to the hope, however small, that we will see Madeleine again. “As we have said repeatedly, we need to know what has happened to our lovely daughter, no matter what.

There will be some major shake-ups in the Royal Family when the Queenaposs reign comes to an end, and several senior members will be in line for new titles and new roles when Charles ascends to the throne. Charlotte, who turned six earlier this month and is fourth in line to the throne, could eventually inherit her great aunt Princess Anneaposs title. The Princess Royal title is traditionally given to the eldest daughter of the monarch, but it doesnapost happen automatically and it is up to William to decide whether Charlotte inherits the title. Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here Regardless of who is king in the future, Charlotte will always retain the style of Royal Highness.Until then, she will have a number of title changes during the reigns of Charles and William. When Charles becomes king, she will become Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Cornwall and likely Princess Charlotte of Wales when her father becomes the Princes of Wales. But she would lose the Princess of Wales title when William becomes king and her older brother George inherits the Prince of Wales title.  Instead, she wouldto being Princess Charlotte.Her mum Kate Middleton would become the Queen Consort, though she is likely to be referred to as Queen Catherine. The celebrity gossip YouTube channel OSSA explained Charlotteaposs future will only change dramatically when her father succeeds his grandfather as king.  It added: “When that happens le as Charlotte knows it will look very dferent, in fact, there is a good chance she’ll lose her titles when her dad is on the throne. “By the time William is King of England, his eldest son George will be Prince of Wales.

OSSA said: “Her right to be Princess of Wales flies out the window when her brother gets the official title of Prince of Wales because a royal lady can only be a princessshe’s married to a prince or the daughter of a prince. “As George’s sister, Charlotte doesn’t fit either category.” Charlotte could become Princess Royal when William is king. The Princess Royal title comes with a lot of responsibilities and strict rules to abide by, especially when it comes to dating. Under ancient British law, anyone who sleeps with the Princess Royal before getting married to her is guilty of treason, which was once punishable by execution, royal expert Duncan Larcombe has explained in the past. He reckons it is most likely that dad William will bestow Charlotte with the Princess Royal title once she marries. Mr Larcombe previously told Town and Country: The title of Princess Royal is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch. Princess Anne had to wait until  before her mother the queen bestowed the title of Princess Royal on her, even though the title had been vacant since .FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrincess CharlottePrince Charles, Prince of WalesPrince WilliamRoyal FamilyThe Queen"},{"url":null,"title":"pub goers hysterics after womans","story":"NewsPub-goers in hysterics after womans attempt to sneak into beer garden goes wrongThe woman flings herself over the pubs railing but the waist of her jeans becomes caught on the metalwork and she hangs upside down as witnesses chuckle into their drinksmirrorShareCommentsBySophie NorrisLorraine King:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video pub-punter-gets-stuck-upside-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:IAlJ,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Pub-goers were left in hysterics after witnessing the embarrassing mishap as they enjoyed their drinks at The Hope and Anchor in Royton, Greater Manchester. Stunned onlooker Nicole Meadows was enjoying a drink at her local on Friday evening when she spotted the daring duo attempting to land a vacant bench. In the hilarious clip, one of the women attempts to step over the fence but appears to get her foot stuck and is trying to disentangle herself from that while her pal decided to e over herself. The second woman flings herself over the railing but the waist of her jeans becomes caught on the metalwork, flipping her the wrong way up and leaving her suspended upside down for more than  seconds.  As -year-old Nicole and other witnesses cackle in the background, the unknown woman is finally helped back over the fence by a stranger who comes to help. Once freed from her predicament, the woman announces aposIaposve hurt my vaginaapos to entertained customers before askingshe can have a seatshe walks around to the proper entrance. Nicole, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, said: It was hilarious. Iaposve never seen anything like that before. It was highly amusing. Everybody was laughing. Theyaposd closed the doors because the pub was full, but there were still a couple of empty benches outside.  The girls were trying to climb over the fence to sit at one of the benches and get served. The doors were closed and there was a sign outside saying they were at full capacity on a blackboard. But itaposs an open beer garden and you can see [the seating]. The first girl managed to get over, but the second one didnapost.  The care worker had been with her mum Vicky Meadows when the chaotic scene caught the attention of the entire beer garden, who all watched on in amusement. In her clip, Nicole can be heard laughing hysterically as the two unknown women became stuck in the awkward positions. Nicole said: Everyoneaposs going wild because everythingaposs reopened. Itaposs got a really big beer garden. Somebody sat at the back of the pub [got up to] try and help her over. [After the incident] she just accepted the fact they werenapost allowed in and tried going somewhere .  I think she wrapped her legs around it to try and save herself from smashing her face open. Margaret Newton, landlady of The Hope and Anchor, said she asked the two women to come back another time and was glad they didnapost come to any harm. Margaret said: The door was shut, she tried to get in and she wasnapost served. Thataposs the only thing I can say. I told her to come back later on when it might have died down, but she didnapost do. I havenapost seen her since. I did ask her to come back. I said aposwe are full love. Iaposm not serving youapos. Iaposm just glad she didnapost hurt herself. Itaposs a light-hearted story. I have no problems. They do tend to climb over the fence. If they climb over the fence, the rule is they donapost get served. Iaposll just be glad when we can get back to normal. Weaposll be able to welcome people back in and save all this hassle.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPubs"},{"url":null,"title":"queens tribute philip touching choice","story":"NewsQueens tribute to Philip with touching choice of dress for State Opening of ParliamentRoyal fans noticed the Queens outfit choice for the State Opening of Parliament held a special signicance and tribute to the Duke of EdinburghmirrorShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  MAY NewsThe Queen delivering the Queens Speech \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

On Tuesday, Her Majesty outlined promises from the Government as she carried out her first major public ceremonial duty since the death of her husband. Fans noticed her outfit choice held a special signicance and tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh.A tweet from a royal fan pointed out: The Queen is wearing the same dress she wore on the photograph released for Prince Philip ’s th birthday.For the Queenaposs Speech, the Queen wore a long blue coat with a matching dress adorned with yellow flowers, and a coordinating blue hat, by Angela Kelly.  It was the same dress the Queen wore in a portrait of her and the Duke of Edinburgh on his th and final birthday. For the first time in  years, the consortaposs throne that is usually placed next to the monarch for the event was absent, following the sad death of Prince Philip last month. Instead Prince Charles followed his late fatheraposs example to take his motheraposs hand and provide support during the formal event.  But it meant that much like Philipaposs funeral, the Queen was pictured alone in a striking reminder of her sad loss. The ceremony did not have all of the pomp and circumstance of a normal State Opening, with no horse-drawn carriages or page boys. Much of its pageantry was missing because of Covid restrictions still in place despite the easing of lockdown measures in England.  The Queen set out the Governmentaposs post-pandemic agenda outlining a raft of new laws the PM hopes will help him fulfil his promise to tackle inequality and level up the country. It included promises to receive more tailored and preventative care through the NHS, to provide measures to tackle obesity and mental health and to bring proposals on social reform forward. She also said proposals will be brought forward to create and support jobs, to support a letime skills guarantee and to help businesses drive economic growth.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnState Opening of ParliamentThe QueenPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRoyal FamilyPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"school rang mum five lay","story":"NewsSchool rang mum-of-five as she lay dying to say she was late picking up kids‘Loving soul’ Iram Shehzadi, , was on her way to pick up her seven-year-old daughter from school in Bradford, West Yorkshire, when she was mowed down just  yards from her homemirrorShareByMark Lister:,  MAY NewsFlowers are laid at the scene of the tragedy just metres from the victims family home in Bradford \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

As paramedics worked in vain to save her le her mobile rang as the school called to ask why she was running late to pick up her child, a witness to the horric crash claims. Police are quizzing  -year-old driver arrested on suspicion of the murder of Mrs Shehzad, who died less than  yards from her home.The mum died when a grey Citroen C ploughed into her near a junction in the neighbourhood, police say. A man who raced to the scene after hearing the crash described a bloodbath, as the victim was carried on the bonnet before the vehicle crashed into boulders beside a grassed area and she was catapulted -ft, hitting a tree head-first. A -year-old man was arrested a short time later, West Yorkshire Police said. Mrs Shehzadi, has an -year-old son, along with two boys and two girls. She was taking her usual daily route to pick up the youngest, her seven-year-old daughter, when she was killed at pm. Uzmat Munir, , a bank employee, was working from his home overlooking the grassed area on Monday afternoon when he heard a massive bang. “I saw the lady laying face down on the grass next to the tree. The car was empty and smashed into the rocks, he said. “My neighbour called an ambulance and we tried to help the lady, but none of us knew CPR. “There was about five of us stood around, not knowing what to do. A woman came before the ambulance arrived and turned her over and tried to revive her, but the poor lady was obviously dead.There was blood flowing from her mouth and a head wound - it was a bloodbath. “The car had hit her, carried on the bonnet and after it hit the rocks, she had flown into the tree. It looked like she had hit her head on the tree.”  Flowers have since laid below the tree, and police remained in the area on Wednesday. Mr Munir added:“I heard that whilst the paramedics tried to resuscitate the woman, her mobile phone rang, and it was the school ringing to let her know she was late picking her kid up.” The victimaposs neighbour Rukhsana Kausar, , said: ”She lived with her husband and five children and was devoted to her children. “Iram had gone to pick up her young daughter, like she does every day at that time, and this terrible thing has happened.” Rehana Nawaz, , who lives on the street where the mum was hit, said: ”I heard a lot of noise and thought it was a fight at first. “I went down and saw her laying down on the ground, face down. I asked a couple of guys standing there to roll her over onto her back. “You could see she had a massive injury to the right side of her head and there was a lot of blood coming from her mouth. “My sister-in-law, who is a teacher and knows CPR, tried about  compressions and then the ambulance arrived. “At first I thought she had been the driver of the car and I saw car keys on the ground beside the vehicle, but the I was told by someone there that the driver had run off. “One of the men who was first on the scene had held her hand and she looked at him as she took her last breath and passed away. “She took that same route every day at the same time to pick up her little girl.” Haris, Mrs Shehzadi’s nephew, said: “It has hit the family, especially her children, really hard. “She was a very good lady who always kept herself to herself. She has helped everybody out. She had a lot of respect from the area. “I used to live near her and see her every day going to pick up her kids from school. “The family are going to be traumatised, she did not deserve this at all.” Another relative said: I went to pay my respects to her husband yesterday and he is still in shock. He still thinks she is coming back, it hasnapost sunk in yet. She was a beautul, kind, loving soul who will always remain in our heart. A cousin, Shab Lush, said: ”She was on her way to school to collect her daughter not knowing what was ahead. Sheaposs gone in this beautul month of Ramadan.” Chief Inspector Daniel Ware, of Bradford District Police, said: “We are continuing to investigate this fatal collision and are supporting the victim’s family at what is clearly a devastating time for them. “I want to thank residents and witnesses who have come forward with information to support the police investigation, and continue to urge witnesses who we may not have spoken with to contact us. “Anyone who can assist our enquiries with information and dashcam or CCTV phone footage is asked to contact West Yorkshire Police via  or online using www.westyorkshire.police.uk livechat quoting log  of  .” FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnWest Yorkshire PoliceCar crashes"},{"url":null,"title":"woman transforms ordinary looking home","story":"NewsWoman transforms ordinary looking home into incredible s replica with time-warp interiorCrossing the threshold to Hannah Halls home in Nottingham is like stepping back in time, with a s interior complete with patterned wallpaper, vintage furniture and a rotary phonemirrorShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsSenior Audience Writer:,  MAY NewsThe house looks ordinary from the outside \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Hannah Hall bought a s-era home in Nottingham with her mum and began fitting out the interior with a decor from another era, such as patterned wallpaper, old appliances and vintage furniture. The kitchen includes black and white tiled flooring, a whistle kettle, exposed wooden beams and an open pantry, and where thereaposs a working rotary phone and a stunning oak wardrobe.aposVintage-obsessedapos Hannah originally bought a working s gas cooker on eBay and has slowly given the home a makeover to match the theme, saying her interest in the wartime period was sparked when her grandparents introduced her to the fashion, film and TV of the time. Her grandparents gave her some of the furniture which now features in the home, and Hannah says - despite owning a TV - she plans to continue to strip back the home instead of turning to modern technology. Hannah said: Iaposve always been interested in vintage things and I get told that Iaposm an old head on young shoulders. When me and my mum moved into the house, it was totally dferent to what it is now and we wanted to unearth its potential. Itaposs my mumaposs first buy because sheaposs always rented homes, so I wanted to make it extra special. The theme really started to take off when we did the kitchen in a s style and we loved it so much that we decided we really wanted to go with that theme throughout the house.  The kitchenaposs finishing touch was the beautul s gas cooker - it works an absolute dream and has inspired us to live a little simpler. The house is kind of like an ode to my grandpa, who was born in . He was a signicant part of my le and really got me interested in the s era as a kid - I was enamoured by his droplets of wisdom. My nanaposs taste in vintage and eccentric fashion has also inspired me to dress quirky. I feel like my home is an adoption centre for vintage things. I absolutely love it but I know itaposs not to everyoneaposs taste because itaposs a massive niche.  After the kitchen was redone, we went a bit mad and just started collecting dferent items such as a -year-old tin opener, vintage wallpaper and old paintings. The gas cooker in the kitchen definitely comes in handythe electricity goes out on our street because weaposre still able to cook dinner. Itaposs not what you expect when you come in and every single room has vintage touches. Our family thinks the house is really quirky and is like a little time capsule. Everyone loves coming over and kicking it a little old school for a bit.  Hannah says when they bought the home from an old family friend everywhere was rather beige and needed an overhaul having lost its charm. The renovation work uncovered the original floorboards and staircase, which bought it back to le a bit.While continuing to add to her s home, Hannah posts videos of the project on her @Realvintagedollshouse TikTok account, saying: Vintage items have a bit more soul than modern things and I get a kick out of finding something that might have so much story behind it.Iaposm a big believer that we should honour the past and I donapost think younger people these days necessarily appreciate how dferent things used to be. Reminding people that it wasnapost always like this hopefully helps them appreciate how far weaposve come. Weaposre still working on the house every day and weaposre hoping to get a s-style front door and also transform the back garden, using my grandpaaposs old Raleigh bike as a flower feature.What do you think of the home  Let us know in the comments.

Except for one woman, who *almost* didnapost have to imagine, after she had her babies swapped not once, but twice, after giving birth in hospital.TikToker Becky Martin claims hospital staff tried to hand over the wrong baby to her on two separate occasions when she was recovering in hospital from the births of her first two children. So I actually have had my babies switched by the hospital. Not once, but twice. Now it didn’t get to the point with one of them being two years old. It was immediately noticed and corrected, but still, she explained. With my first, they wheeled in a baby boy and they were like… we fed your baby for you, and I was like… I’m breastfeeding  And they were like… oh sorry, wrong baby. Becky went on to say: With my second, they wheeled in a baby girl and they were like… here’s your daughter, and we were like… she’s already in the room with us. Oops. So, you can appreciate that when it came to her third child, under no circumstances was she going to let that baby out of her sight, even when it came to doctors visits. Of course, they fought us on it. The charge nurse came in and said [they] had to take that baby out to do testing. I said… well, you can either do it in my room or I’ll accompany you to the lab, or we’ll do it or we’ll do it at his first doctor’s appointment, she continued, adding that the doctor joked: aposThataposs right Becky, weaposre all trying to steal your baby.apos Hey, once is an accident, twice is a pattern, she concluded.

The woman is pregnant with her second child and had already decided on her favourite name ahead of the little oneaposs arrival. She had agreed to give the baby her motheraposs name as a middle name, but when the woman told her mum the first name, she scoffed, letting out a judgemental sigh. The soon-to-be mum was says she was offended by the reaction and as a result changed her mind on the middle name - leaving her mother furious at the decision. Taking to Reddit, the woman posted: I’m due any day with my second child and had my heart set on my babyaposs name.  The middle name is the same as my mother’s middle name and the first name is something I always liked and thought was cute. I’ve told my family this name before and that’s that. The other day, my mom had apparently forgotten what the first name was so I reminded her and she let out a judgmental aposughapos. I asked her what’s up and she said that she doesn’t like the name and thinks the kid will be made fun of for it. The name isn’t at all made up or even that unique. It’s a pretty average name. I got frustrated. Yesterday it came up again and she remembered that the middle name was gonna be the same as hers. But I told her I decided to change the middle name to something , since she wanted to be judgmental and negative about the first name. She started crying and got pretty upset. Said that I just did that to hurt her.  The woman shared the story on Reddit to seek advice, and added some background information on their relationship. She said the mother was aposextremely controllingapos, and that she never had a say on her le when she was growing up. As such, she moved out as soon as possible. The post continued: Although her reaction to her grandchild’s name may seem minor, I know her. She reacts like that because she wants a dferent name, or to have some sort of influence over the name. She uses her judgment as a way to try and control me and my decisions. That’s why I get so angry. The post garnered much discussion online, with most people agreeing that both the women were in the wrong. One user posted: Sounds like mom is an a**hole in general but in this specic situation Iaposm gonna have to say everybody sucks here because you were both hurtful to each other. That being said I understand what you did and I probably would have done the same. And another posted: Her reaction to the name was not only hurtful, but also calculated to pressure you to change the name into something she likes. That type of childish behaviour warrants a time-out, and you are right to reconsider the second name. I also would not want to honour someone who acts like that. They lost the privilege.What do you think of her decision  Let us know in the comments.

The anonymous woman shared her story on Reddit, saying that she will regularly pretend to be out of cash to cut costs and dodge awkward situations. She has a string of examples where it worked in her favour, including a runaway car repair bill and getting out of a pyramid selling scheme, but her boyfriend has said it makes him feel uncomfortable. She turned to the internet for advice, asking whether she was in the wrong as the issue is putting strain on her relationship.  The original post reads: I am doing an engineering job making a good amount of money and I save a lot so Iaposm definitely not actually broke. I sometimes act like I am, and it frustrates my boyfriend. Iaposll give a few examples. A few weeks ago I went to get some work done on my car. I called ahead and the shop quoted me for parts and labour so I said ok and dropped off my car. Later that day they call me and say my car is ready to be picked up, but the job was way more complicated than expected so the cost was actually  . I told them that was more than we agreed on and they were still being pushy. I just go, aposoh God, Iaposm so sorry but I donapost have the extra money. I called around to all the shops in town this morning and went with yaposall because your original quote was the only one I could manageapos.  The guy at the shop kinda hemmed and hawed and I go, aposmaybe you could take the parts back out, Iaposm really sorry but thataposs way too muchapos. He was like, aposno no, Iaposll honour the original quoteapos. So that was something I didnapost feel that bad about but my boyfriend said it made him uncomfortable to hear. The Reddit user then goes on to list other times she used the technique to protect her bank balance, including dodging a pyramid scheme. She said things all kicked off when she went out with her boyfriend to a party thrown by one of his friends, to celebrate a new business venture. But it turned out the new business was a pyramid scheme, and that the woman was expected to invest.  The woman said she had to use her tried and tested excuse to dodge the situation, and said: Uhh thataposs really expensive, I really didnapost expect to be spending anything tonight, so itaposs really not in my budget. But still her boyfriend was furious and kicked off for her aposbroke actapos, and he kept bringing it up - even weeks later when she received a aposkapos pay cheque. The internet was quick to rally around the woman, saying she was not in the wrong for what she did. One user said: No one should be doing work above and beyond the quote without discussing it with your first. This sounds like he was trying to take advantage. Salespeople earn more money the more you spend. They aren’t looking out for your budget. There’s nothing wrong with being firm with them about want to spend. As far as your boyfriend, well it’s a flag that he’s more concerned about the other people than he is about your goals. It sounds like your boyfriend has an issue with your income. Who careshis friends think you are broke. Why is what they think more of an issue to him than your financial goals.

Sadly, many men didnapost heed this warning, and have been left believing that women actually peel the skin off their faces when theyaposre on their period. Well, the female body has done stranger things, it must be said.The bizarre and obviously extremely incorrect belief came from a TikTok video of model Dakota Fink peeling what we can only imagine is a face mask off her face.Throwback to when men didn’t know we had to peel off layers of our skin after our period, she wrote alongside the clip. Ah, those were the days.  The clip was quickly inundated with comments from other women who shared their ownexperiences of skin shedding during that time of the month. Youaposve really got to love the internet sometimes. This happened while I was applying makeup because I forgot and wasted so much foundation, one TikTok user commented, while another added: Someone has to slap me really hardfor it to peel off. If anyone wants to volunteer just holler. A third wrote: For those asking, itaposs supposed to start two to three years after your first period, usually one to three days out of your cycle.

After a month of observing daily fasts from sunrise to sunset we are ready to feast with loved ones. For my family, however, it will be a solemn occasion as it will be the first Eid without my father who passed away just three weeks ago. He was the one who would cook up Eid specialities and tasty treats for us- taking on the mantle ever since my mother passed away five years ago. But today I feel the searing loss of not only my father but of the many innocent lives lost in this latest act of Israeli aggression. And I’m not the only one. My social media feed would normally be a constant stream of Eid recipes or make-up tutorials or young women showing off their hairstyles and henna designs in preparation of the big day. But instead young people - of all faiths, races and background - are highlighting the human rights abuses in Palestine. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  The conflict in this region is nothing new but in recent days it has become deadlier than ever and it seems to be young people who are shouting the loudest to bring the issue to attention. The Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem is the third holiest site for Muslims and of such signicance it merits a mention in the Holy book, the Quran. To storm in and fire rubber bullets at worshippers is abhorrent. If a ‘Muslim’ did the same thing to a place of worship we would rightly call them a terrorist so why is it okaythe state of Israel does it  And despite the fact that the United Nations has repeatedly declared that the settlers are violating international law, the expansion keeps happening.  This isn’t about Muslims against Jews either. We share many aspects of our faiths and God has told us that Jews are People of the Book like us. They are our brethren. I have heard many impassioned speeches by practising Jews who have spoken out against the Israeli regime. One of the most powerful was a Jewish man who said his entire family on both sides had been wiped out by the Holocaust.

With that comes nerve-shredding tension and a desperate need from players not to be the one that messes things up at this late stage.That sort of pressure seems simple to talk about for us.For the players, it could be a moment that spoils – or indeed elevates – an entire year’s work.But that drama is why we love football.And the introduction of the play-offs a few years back injected much-needed le into our lower leagues.That’s for next week, though.A next week Dundee need to ensure they are still alive and kicking for.I’ve very much enjoyed the ‘pressure’ talk between the two managers, James McPake and John McGlynn trying to ramp things up on each other.There’s no doubt, though, that the Dark Blues are expected to get through.The question is now whether the Dundee squad has the characters to stand up in the face of that sort of expectation.From my personal viewpoint, they do – but the only way it can be proved is by winning this tie.Over the league season, Dundee showed they are a better team than Rovers by finishing above them.They have better, more experienced players.For a lot of the season, though, I’d say Raith had a better team. As in a collective unit working together.A big test for me will be how the Dark Blues begin the game after  days without a match.Whatever happens, it’s going to be a tense  minutes .Get prepared Dees.Dundee United’s season is over now, isn’t it I had big hopes they’d be able to rise to the occasion on Saturday.However, they didn’t really give themselves a foothold in the semi-final against Hibs.It was a performance that badly needed an inidual spark from somebody.But there hasn’t been a huge amount of that this season from the Tangerines.It’s been a decent campaign from Micky Mellon’s men, don’t get me wrong.However, attacking style and verve hasn’t been a word associated with them often.The quarter-final apart, I guess – and I don’t buy the ‘Aberdeen were awful’ story either.Yes, the opposition was poor but United most certainly weren’t.However, that day has only been a flash in the pan it seems.By the time I write my next column, their season will be over with games against Motherwell and St Mirren left tonight and Saturday.A weekend clash between the two beaten semi-finalists does not sound a cheery affair.What United need to do now, though, is look ahead to next season.Give some youngsters a chance in these two games to show they can be part of the squad next term.And try to finish off what has been a definite step in the right direction on a positive note.It’s always a shame to see players miss out on major tournaments through injury.Sadly it’s been a story Scotland fans haven’t had to put up with for a long, long time!Looks like Kenny McLean and Ryan Jack will miss the Euros.Disappointing for them but thankfully we are very well-stocked in quality central midfielders.Whether either of those would make Steve Clarke’s first XI is up for debate.What it does is open the door for the likes of Billy Gilmour and David Turnbull.Players like those two are the future of the team. LEE WILKIE: I wouldn#t be surprisedLee Ashcroft is Dundee#s main man again for the play-offs and disappointment after Dundee United#s lacklustre semi showing\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: I wouldn#t be surprisedLee Ashcroft is Dundee#s main man again for the play-offs and disappointment after Dundee United#s lacklustre semi showing# #

I’m surprised he’s not played Premiership football his entire career.“He hasn’t surprised me this season, though,anything I think he can kick on.“I told him that when he got the awards, he’s a Premiership centre-back.“He wants to help us get there and then to kick on again.”Ashcroft was a clear winner of the Andrew De Vries Trophy, as voted for by Dundee Supporters Association clubs.He picked up  inidual nominations with Charlie Adam and Jordan Marshall next closest on six each.And that’s the one that will mean most, says McPake.“Lee will say the Player’s Player is the one you want but to get the supporters’ one I think is really important,” the Dens boss said.“That shows what the fans think of you, even when they aren’t here watching the games.“That’ll give him a boost, though he is high on confidence anyway because he’s playing well.“I love working with him, he always wants to learn. His work ethic is out of this world so I am delighted with him.“But, he has these awards, but we want more success from him.“We’re hoping for four big performances from him because that will go a long way to getting us where we want to be.” Lee Ashcroft #thrilled# to pick up Dundee Player#s Player AND Fan#s Player of the Year ahead of play-off crunch\" title\"#Lee Ashcroft #thrilled# to pick up Dundee Player#s Player AND Fan#s Player of the Year ahead of play-off crunch# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-ashcroft-thrilled-to-pick-up-dundee-players-player-and-fans-player-of-the-year-ahead-of-play-off-crunch embed # secretHMLvMzkFw\" data-secret\"HMLvMzkFw\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/medw-dynamo-robert-lindsay-9_28651986-558x372.jpg ","title":"six degrees north north east brewery to shut two pubs in the central belt as they refocus their efforts on the region","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remSix Degrees North is shutting its two central belt premises in order to #refocus# their efforts on the north-east.The Stonehaven-born business has announced plans to close their premises in Glasgow and Edinburgh due to the effects of Covid.Three of their bars, in Aberdeen, Stonehaven and Dundee will remain open.Founder Robert Lindsay revealed why they had made the #dficult# and #seemingly impossible# decision to shut two venues.He said: #Six°North is a business that has an international inspiration, but our heart belongs in the North East of Scotland. Our family, friends and the majority of our team are all here.#What is important to me is that Six°North continues its journey without losing its soul, and continues to offer opportunity and reward to those that have been committed to our business over the last eight years.#After over twelve months of reflection, it’s obvious to me that the current business structure cannot deliver this.#To achieve this we must take a small step back, consolidate our business in the short term, and be in as strong a position as possible as markets and opportunities open up again post-Covid.#We have made the dficult, and sometimes a seemingly impossible decision, to refocus on our efforts and operations in the North East.#This means we intend to build on what we have created in Stonehaven, Aberdeen, Laurencekirk, and Dundee. It also means saying goodbye to Six°North Edinburgh and Six°North Glasgow.#Six Degree North#s first bar was opened on Littlejohn Street in Aberdeen in June , two months after they first started out next door to the Marine Hotel in Stonehaven.They then moved to larger brewery premises in Laurencekirk in October , where they expanded their brewing capacity.A second bar was opened on Dumbarton Road in Glasgow in March , before a third was opened on Howe Street in Edinburgh five months later.Their last premises was unveiled in December  on Union Street in Dundee.The future is still bright for the brewery as they aim to consolidate their business across the north-east of Scotland.Their premises in Glasgow has been taken over by another bar but continue to serve Six Degrees North, while their Edinburgh home has yet to find new owners.Mr Lindsay spoke about his #great love# for both of the venues, their customers, staff, and communities surrounding them.He added: #We have many beers yet to brew, many drinkers yet to meet and some wonderfully exciting opportunities to develop.#We have an ability to create erse products and services within the brewing, hospitality, and tourism sector, but this will not be best realised for us by operating venues from afar.#It is the end for our central belt venue adventure, we are not ing home with our tail between our legs, but proud of what we brought, when we brought it, the staff that helped us, and the customers that came through the door.#We will be forever grateful and honoured to have served these people and to have been part of their communities.#Six°North may be ing home, but we are very much looking forward to writing the next stage of our adventure and continuing to catch up with our friends further afield.#The brewery will continue to supply its beers across the whole of Scotland and the UK.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-four-glasgow-teachers-conquered-mighty-whirlpool-scottish-first","story":"WHEN keen kayakers Jim, Angus, Bill and Peter found themselves storm-bound on an island off the west coast in , they dreamt up a history-making plan."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-milton-couples-love-lasted-lifetime","story":"A PICTURE paints a thousand words, the old saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-green-brigade-respond-removal-palestine-display","story":"CELTICsupportersgroup, The Green Brigade, have hit back at the club after the removal of a Palestinian flag display in Celtic Park."},{"url":null,"title":"save-venues-plea-sturgeon","story":"The Chair of Glasgow Le has written to Nicola Sturgeon, over the financial crisis facing the organisation."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgowist-bath-street-favourite-set-re-open-moskito-returns","story":"A key part of the Bath Street bar circuit for decades and perennially popular with the cityrsquos hospitality and entertainment industry workers, Moskito s under new management and with a radically dferent look.

It is a citrus pale ale which has been brewed with zest and tea leaves to create a refreshing summer beer that is reminiscent of a lemon iced tea.Light and sessionable, the team brewed the beer using lemongrass and Earl Grey tea that was sourced from our Edinburgh-based leaf tea experts, Eteaket.It is served in a ml bottle and priced at £.. With prices starting at just £., this month’s festival features  beers from  dferent Scottish brewers including fan favourites and new profiles set to become the ultimate summer sips.#Our business really has changed for good# #

after anger at the Conservative nominee for the job.A rapid meeting of the urgent business committee unanimously agreed Councillor Jenny Laing would become sole leader of the Tory, Labour and Independent Alliance administration.Councillor Ryan Houghton withdrew his candidacy for co-leader after outrage over historic online comments he made around a decade ago.However, he has been appointed convener of the powerful city growth and resources committee, which controls the Town House purse strings.And he remains the leader of the Aberdeen Conservative group.Unearthed in  during the general election campaign, the Conservative was suspended by the party for the comments regarding the Holocaust, Muslims and homosexuality.Having apologised, he was cleared and readmitted six months later following a QC-led investigation.The vacancy, which has not been filled, arose as Councillor Douglas Lumsden MSP gives up the job of co-leader and steps down as convener of the city growth and resources committee.The Conservative was elected to the Scottish Parliament on the list vote on Saturday.He plans to continue on as a councillor, splitting his time between the Town House and Holyrood, arguing a by-election would cost too much to hold to find a replacement for less than a year.Fellow councillors-turned-MSPs, the SNP#s Jackie Dunbar and Audrey Nicoll, are understood to be doing the same.Aberdeen Labour leader Mrs Laing has already served as council leader during the previous council session – when her group was the largest within the ruling coalition.She replaced now Lord Provost Barney Crockett as leader in , remaining in place until after the  election while the legal practicalities of installing co-leaders were ironed out.Mrs Laing said she was #delighted# with the unanimous agreement to the new allocation of the top positions and said she would focus on Aberdeen#s #social and economic recovery# from Covid-.“Councillor Houghton has made clear what his position was earlier in the week,# she added.#He felt that the speculation around his position was a distraction from focusing on that recovery, and therefore we have put forward the positions we have.“I look forward to working with colleagues inside the council and partners from outside the council to make sure we are delivering on that recovery agenda for the people of Aberdeen.#It’s vitally important we get that right over the next year.”With Mr Houghton heading up the resources committee, Mrs Laing has been appointed vice-convener.The Aberdeen Labour chief has given up her job as commissioning convener to be replaced by John Wheeler.Mr Wheeler had been operations and education convener, but has now been replaced by his deputies Philip Bell and Tauqeer Malik respectively.While the local authority now has a solely Labour leader, the Conservatives now oversee two of the three main financial levers of the council.The third, the capital committee, remains under the control of Marie Boulton, the leader of the Independent Alliance group within the political administration.Mrs Laing will remain convener of the urgent business committee and Mr Houghton will be vice-convenerThe Tory leader, who is retaining his £, council business manager salary, told us: #I am looking forward to working with my coalition colleagues on the regeneration of the city.#News Mr Houghton#s -strong group had given up the council leadership to Mrs Laing, one of nine Aberdeen Labour members was seized upon by opponents.SNP group leader Alex Nicoll, who voted for the new council structure at the meeting said afterwards: #The Tories in Aberdeen are clearly in turmoil given they have relinquished they spot of co-leader of the Council even though they remain the largest party within the Administration#s ruling coalition.##We have previously heard that Councillor Laing was the de facto leader of Aberdeen City Council and that has now been rubberstamped today # even though Aberdeen Labour were rejected by voters at the last council election with that being reaffirmed only last week with the electorate rejecting Labour once again at the Scottish Parliament elections.#Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Greig, who also voted for the new leadership structure, said: “It has clearly been dficult for the ruling coalition to find a satisfactory replacement that reflects the changed power relations from the Conservative, Labour and Independent side.#A solution has been found that gives the Conservatives more influence in council business infor not acting as co-leader.  The appointment of committee chairs is a matter for the coalition to agree. They have chosen to increase the prominence and role of the Conservative group in the work of the Council.#By working together the Conservatives, Labour and Independents are free to let Aberdeen

that caters for children with additional support needs says the government must allow the sector to reopen and “let kids be kids”.Becky Mennie, the founder of the Inverurie-based charity BECS Inclusive Soft Play Centre, has not been allowed to open her premises since it shut last March.If Scotland is able to move to Level One restrictions on the indicative date of June , her facility will finally be able to reopen, and Ms Mennie said she “can’t wait to have little people in here again”.However, she has raised questions over why some venues have been allowed to open before hers, such as role-play centres.She said: “I’ve been trying to work out why we can go to a role-play café or trampoline park but we can’t go to a soft play centre.“Some have opened already because they’ve got role-play sections or organised activities.“We’ve built an indoor sensory garden, and our sensory room has been upgraded so it’s got more manageable, tougher equipment that’s easier to clean.“So it’s going to be easier for us to clean than ever.”Almost all leisure and entertainment venues, including soft play centres, will be allowed to open under Level One restrictions, with the exception of adult entertainment and nightclubs.Ms Mennie said she has tried to contact the first minister about her concerns to no avail.She said: “I’ve directly e-mailed the first minister’s e-mail address probably about  times a day, and have had nothing.“Tier One is meant to be on June , and soft play can open then, but it’s not the point.“We’re tiny, inside here it’s really manageable, easy to clean, and really there’s little dference between us and a nursery.“We’re now focusing on getting ready to open, I’ve been at work cleaning and building new equipment, and we just can’t wait to have little people in here again.“We’re just looking forward to opening so we can finally let kids be kids.”A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: #We do not underestimate the severe impact this pandemic has had on soft play centres across Scotland, and we expect them to re-open when Scotland enters Level One.#This is dependent on continued progress on vaccination against Coronavirusand suppression of the virus.“We have always said we will keep plans under review and accelerate the lting of restrictionspossible, and we will continue engaging with the soft play sector on this.”For as little as £. a

many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses. The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

preparations for a potential senior international debut are dferent to most.The -year-old could make her bow for Scotland against Ireland in four T matches in Belfast later this month.However, her build-up to those games is being dominated by exams.As a fth-year pupil at Gordon Schools in Huntly, Lister is currently sitting her Highers, while also dreaming of representing her country at senior level, having previously played for the A side and age group teams.She said: “It’s quite tough to fit everything in, especially this year, I’m in the middle of my exams.“I’ve got eight exams and the last exam is the day before we go to Ireland.“So this year it has been very full on, but the school has been really good.“They give me authorised absence when I need to go away and then I catch up when I come back or do extra work before I go.It#s quite tough to fit everything in.#“But this year doing my Highers it’s been more dficult because they’re the big exams.“Hopefully by the end of the next two weeks I’ll be free for cricket all the time.“The next two weeks will be very full on, but I’ll be even more excited to go to Ireland because I’ll be done with exams.“It’s dficult and I’m having to balance quite a lot between study and cricket.“But I’m trying to make sure I get enough of both and I met the new Scotland coach Mark Coles for the first time last Wednesday.“He must have heard from the coaches and the captain about me and that was why I got picked, because he’d never actually met me or seen me play.“It was good to meet him and I’ve been able to balance my cricket and my studies quite well.“At the weekend I was playing cricket on Saturday and then on Sunday I was studying all day.”Scotland’s fixtures later this month will be their first since September .They had been been scheduled to play Ireland in Spain last November and then in March.Lister was in both those squads, but the fixtures were called off because of the pandemic.She hopes she can make her senior international debut this month in the fixtures to be played on May , ,  and .The Stoneywood-Dyce wicketkeeper added: “It would be unbelievable, I still can’t get my head around the fact I play for Scotland and possibly have this opportunity to make my debut coming up when we’re away.“I’ve had a couple of opportunities which ended up being called off.“We were supposed to go to Spain in November and then again in March, but they got cancelled because of Covid.“I’ve been waiting for my opportunity and hopefully I will get that opportunity in Ireland to make my debut.“It means a huge amount to me and to my family.”If she does make her Scotland debut this month Lister hopes it can lead to more international action both this summer and further down the line.“To be honest I think I’m at the start,” the teenager said.“Hopefully I have many more games to come and I just want to progress my cricket as far as I can.“We’ve got World Cup qualiers at the end of the summer and that will be our main focus.“We’ve also got Commonwealth Games qualiers next year as well, so there are opportunities there.”Huntly has long been a hotbed for cricket, with Scotland and England international Kirstie Gordon another to have come through the Castle Park club.Lister started playing at primary school after her older brother Stuart had taken up the game.She credits Huntly coach Neil Nicol with helping her and others make their breakthrough.Lister said: “I got started through my brother, who is a couple of years older than me.“He played at the club in Huntly and as the younger sister I wanted to do what he was doing.“So I started playing in primary four and played with Huntly for a good few years until  when I moved to Stoneywood-Dyce to try to progress that bit further.“Neil Nicol does a great job at Huntly, he goes into all the schools and he’s done a huge amount for girls# cricket.“Now there are only-girls# sessions and things like that and there’s a huge amount of junior members and that is mostly down to Neil Nicol who works hard to keep the girls interested and that’s really good.”Two years ago, Lister left Huntly to join Eastern Premier Division side Stoneywood-Dyce and play at the highest level of the Scottish club game.She is thankful for the support and encouragement she’s had at Peoples Park as she plays senior cricket against men.Lister said: “They’ve made me feel really welcome. I played rugby at a young age as well and I’ve done lots of dferent sports and I’ve been used to being the only girl on a team.“They’ve been really good. I’m playing men’s cricket and sometimes you get a few funny looks when you turn up and opposition realise I’m playing.“But Stoneywood-Dyce have been really good and I don’t feel like I am the only girl # we’re all just team-mates.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"julie-forrest-loses-open-singles-world-bowls-competition","story":"BORDERS bowler Julie Forrest has been knocked out of the open singles at the World Indoor Bowls Championships .Forrest lost her last- match todayagainst Englandrsquos Greg Harlow, the competitionrsquos sixth seed.Forrest, from Hawick, shared the opening set -, but she was defeated -

evidence of mammals gathering by the sea, researchers say.The findings suggest mammals may have first used marine habitats at least . million years earlier than previously thought, in the late Paleocene , rather than the Eocene .Researchers examined and photographed more than , metres of fossilised footprints recently discovered within the Hanna Formation in Wyoming, US, in an area dated back to  million years ago by plant and pollen fossils.They identied ious dferent tracks, including one set that showed relatively large, five-toed footprints, comparable to the foot size of a modern-day brown bear, while another showed medium-sized, four-toed footprints.The authors suggest the five-toed prints were made by Coryphodon, a type of semiaquatic Pantodont, similar to a hippopotamus.While the four-toed prints did not match skeletal evidence of mammals known from the late Paleocene, they show similarities with artiodactyls and tapiroids, which have yet to be shown to have existed in the Paleocene.Geologist Anton Wroblewski, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Utah, and applied bioersity scientist Bonnie Gulas-Wroblewski of the Texas AM Natural Resources Institute, reported their findings in Scientic Reports.Prof Wroblewski said: ldquoTrace fossils like footprints record interactions between organisms and their environments, providing

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area. It looks amazing.#If you have any other information on this branch of the McNab family, please email editor@campbeltowncourier and this will be passed on to Clare."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 30 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That much is obvious from her work at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, as well as performances in bands including Rhuvaal, one of Scotland#s fastest rising young traditional groups.It is moving that Alex chose to use that talent not only to pay tribute to Robert Black, someone who inspired her passion, but to raise money to help with the costs of operating the helipad named in his memory.We#re sure it#s not the last we#ll hear about Alex#s career in music.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience.

The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"musician-records-sounds-north-berwick-new-album-series-depicting-seven-continents","story":"Ted White, who was brought up on Cromwell Road, where parents Sally and Andrew still live, was approached by music distribution service Platoon to co-ordinate field recordings he had gathered around the world over several years and release them via Apple last month.Each of the seven albums is dedicated to a dferent continent, and the sounds of North Berwickrsquos beaches and harbour feature on the Europe: Earth Sounds album.Ted, , said: ldquoI travel a lot, recording sounds around the world, and Platoon and I collectively came up with the concept of collating my recordings of the past seven years into continents of the world.ldquoI did a bit more travelling to record the bits I didnrsquot have.A former student at Loretto now splitting his time between Liverpool and London, Ted came back to North Berwick to capture the seaside townrsquos night-time atmosphere.He said: ldquoI grew up there so I knew where I could get good sounds without the noise pollution that you get in London.ldquoI recorded lots of midnight sounds on the beaches. Itrsquos very, very quiet where the golf course practice range is, so I went down there.ldquoAnd also the harbour, for lots of the clinking and clanking of sails and at the jetty down by the harbour when the tide was at its highest. I put a load of microphones and left them there as well.With more than  hoursrsquo worth of sounds, Ted used recordings he had made in erse places, including the Amazon rainforest, Rajasthan in India, and Norway.For those places he was unable to get to, such as Antarctica, Ted recreated the noises he imagined would be heard using his own instruments and accessories. For Antarctica, he recorded harsh winds and tents flapping, ice chunks moving around a bath, and also penguins at the zoo.But he was moved toto North Berwick last year for the Europe album.He said: ldquoItrsquos my interpretation of what I think the world sounds like some people will agree, some people wonrsquot.ldquoItrsquos my musical sound diary, so to speak and for the Europe album there were places that I felt connected to, so I recorded a lot in the Highlands, around Aberfeldy, in the winter, to get those blustery sounds, and a lot around North Berwick because thatrsquos where I grew up and, to be honest, when yoursquore trying to capture sounds itrsquos so dficult to find places which have not a lot of noise pollution, and North Berwick in the night for some reason is not that loud.The Mindfulness Nature albums can be found online at sites including Apple Music and Spoty."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-churches-helping-food-donations-pandemic","story":"Musselburgh Baptist Church opens its foodbank every Thursday morning between am and noon, while St Andrewrsquos High Church members have been helping out East Lothian Foodbank.Ross McNab, assistant pastor at the baptist church, said it was ldquoamazing that the congregation was back together meeting in person since the end of March, adding that the church wanted to extend ldquoa warm welcome to our wider community to come join us.He added: ldquoWe are meeting together every Sunday and currently hold three services at am, .am and noon.

Bees and other pollinating insects will be on the hunt at other times of year too,\" says Perry. \"Spring nectar sources can help pollinators to refuel after their hibernation period, and in autumn it can help them build energy reserves for the winter months. Be sure to plant with the widest range of blooming periods in mind, so the wildle never goes hungry.\"The calendar is designed to help gardeners of all abilities turn their outdoor spaces into a pollinator paradise all year round, buzzing with a riot of colour, texture and scent and a perfect way to contribute to World Bee Day .These are some of the plants which Perry recommends to help bees through all four seasons...SPRINGLungwort - the lovely lungwort flower grows low to the ground, and blooms early to bring food to the first pollinators of spring. They grow best in containers, so theyre great for planting in a small space.Peony - these pink beauties are rich in pollen, and pollinating insects love their single blooms. Plant your peonies in rich, dry soil in the sun.Magnolia - our buzzing buddies are drawn to the magnicent magnolias saucer-sized blooms, and love to snack on their sweet nectar. Magnolias love sun and acid soil with lots of moisture.Pussy willow - pussy willow pollen is high in protein, and the spring bloom provides an early source of nutrition for our busy friends.SUMMERLavender - At home in a Mediterranean style garden and also in pots or as a low hedge for potagers, lavender produces both pollen and nectar, making it a great food source for honey bees. They even create lavender-flavoured honey from the plant. Lavender does well in full sun in sandy or chalky, well-drained soil - nothing thats too rich.Foxglove - honey bees and bumblebees work together to pollinate this classic cottage garden favourite. The bumblebee creates holes in the side of the flower to make it easier for the honey bee to swoop in and access the flowers pollen.Hawthorn - our hive heroes can make dark and rich honey from hawthorn nectar. This flower grows best in sunny conditions and is tolerant of all soil types.Marjoram - marjoram is a favourite of humans and our pollinating pals alike - these nectar-rich flowers are actually a perennial herb and close relative of oregano.AUTUMNAster - these pretty perennials with daisy-like flowers ying from purple, violet, and lavender to pink with orange-yellow centres, need lots of water. Its worth adding a mulch to retain the moisture, but theyre worth it to keep the bees happy and help honey bees build up reserves of pollen for winter to get them through the cold months. Plant asters in full sun for them to shine.Honeysuckle - This fast-growing climber, which can be deciduous or evergreen, bearing blooms ranging from creamy-white through yellow to red, is famed for its powerful scent and is a magnet for bees. It starts to flower in the summer but can continue to autumn, given the right conditions. It prefers a sunny spot and isnt fussy about the soil.Single-bloom dahlias - If youre wanting to attract bees, go for the single bloom types of dahlia such as the Happy Single Series over the other ieties such as pompoms or balls, which are less accessible to insects.Sedum - Their pretty flowerheads are full of nectar which makes these low-growing perennials perfect for the front of a border or in prairie plantings, flowering right through to October. Sedum flowers are perfect for honey bees as a late source of pollen and nectar, helping to build up honey stores for the colder winter.WINTERWinter aconite - these low-growing small tuberous perennials from the buttercup family produce bright yellow cup-shaped flowers which are good for ground cover and provide a burst of winter and spring colour under shrubs and roses.Mahonia - Clusters of highly scented bright yellow flowers appear in winter on these tough, spiky evergreen shrubs which are easy to grow, produce lots of nectar and also provide purple to black berries in the autumn, a feast for the birds.Helleborus - hellebores provide sugar-rich nectar and high-protein pollen to help keep the bees energetic and strong through the middle of winter. They thrive in alkaline soil and their subtle shades ranging from cream to deep purple will bring le to a darker area, as they are tolerant of shade.Snowdrop - these pint-sized beauties are among the first bulbs to emerge in winter, providing rich nectar when other food is hard to find. Plant dferent ieties which flower at dferent times in winter to give the bees a longer foraging season.Crocus - these hardy flowers can break through ice and snow to bring food to winter honey bees. Plant them in the sun so that the flowers will fully open and make it easier for the bees to forage on the nectar. Crocuses naturalise well so can create carpets of colourful flowers in winter.For more information on the Hives For Lives programme visit rowsehoney."},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-rhubarb-strawberry-double-crust-pie---perfect-alfresco-tea-party","story":"Ingredientsg rhubarb tablespoons muscovado sugarZest of an unwaxed lemon and a squeeze of juice teaspoon grated fresh ginger strawberriesFor the pastryg self-rising flour, sievedg ground almondsg caster sugarPinch of saltg cold unsalted butter, cubed free range egg yolk-  tablespoons iced waterA little milk to wash.A -cm oven-proof plate, well butteredPrepare the fillingWash and trim the rhubarb and cut into pieces.

When a lot is at stake, a lot of people turn out.Results still to come, of course. But let us work for now on the very reasonable assumption that Nicola Sturgeon will be ing to work on Monday as the First Minister of Scotland. What will immediately confront her Self-evidently, the Covid crisis ndash and its concomitant economic challenges. However, along with that, she will have to form a new Cabinet. One third of the previous team stood down at the election.Read more from Brian Taylor: Parties united by one thing: a desire for voters to just move onSo Ms Sturgeon will have to govern in future without the sagacious counsel of Aileen Campbell, Roseanna Cunningham, Jeane Freeman and Michael Russell.Ms Sturgeon may also take the opportunity to reshape her Cabinetrsquos structure and responsibilities, while preserving gender balance.That Cabinet exodus is matched in the lower Ministerial ranks and on the back benches. In addition, elections tend to generate involuntary departures. Democracy would notwithout such Parliamentary churn, however hard it is for iniduals.All the newbies ndash on all sides of the chamber ndash will need to learn, and quickly: not least because the anxious citizens of Scotland want speedy action in the continuing contest with coronavirus. When will we be safe  Where can we go on holiday Those decisions are urgent. Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints. If we all obey the rules.As for international travel, the UK Government has now set out its thinking. The Scottish Government has tended to favour a more cautious approach. Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence.

They might, at the very least, prefer to delay the decision.Finally, from the political to the personal. Nicola Sturgeon must be simply exhausted. A bizarre yet enervating election on top of endless endeavours to counter coronavirus and sustain the economy.All that plus Alex Salmond, seemingly at her shoulder for months, leading up to his unwanted offer of Holyrood help in pursuit of independence.For Nicola Sturgeon, then, time for rest and recuperation.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

Who it is that represents the Establishment appears to have changed. We find that, confusingly for some, the Tories now appear to be turning into the party of the working class.:Stuart Waiton: Scots university suspends lecturer as sop to woke warriorsAt least part of the reaction against Labour in England is down to the fact that the Labour Party essentially rejected the Brexit vote and, on many issues, appear to have become the voice of the politically correct.Refusing to accept a democratic vote is never the best advertisement for a political party and portraying the white working class as a bunch of deplorable racists is not likely to appeal to these voters.In Scotland, things are both dferent and the same.Many Scottish voters detest the authoritarian nature of the SNP.

And it is they who today use the police to enforce their will onto the people.In comparison, the Tories, just by standing still, by thinking itrsquos probably not best to arrest parents for giving their kids a light smack or thinking it may not be a good thing to arrest people for saying ldquoincorrect things in their own home, suddenly find themselves as the anti-establishment party.Of course, the extent to which we can trust the Tories to defend peoplersquos basic freedoms and to hold back this tide of policing everyday le is highly debatable.

The case around Hanvey is a little more complicated than MacAskill, whorsquos a straightforward defector from the SNP to Alba.In , Hanvey was the SNPrsquos candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. He was dropped in November over using anti-semitic language on social media. Despite his suspension, Hanvey appeared on the ballot next to the SNP name as the deadline for candidates to be nominated had passed.After election, he initially sat as an independent. He apologised for anti-semitic language and was readmitted to the SNP. In , he was appointed the SNPrsquos spokesperson for the Westminster Health and Social Care Select Committee.

NEIL MACKAY: The Alba effectClearly, voters represented by Hanvey, MacAskill and others ndash such as the Inverclyde councillor Christopher McEleny ndash didnrsquot vote for them as members of Alba. So surely, the only honourable course of action is for these defectors to stand down immediately and submit themselves to by-elections. If the people they currently represent still find them suitable as representatives, then all well and good. However, to cling on to position, power and a public pay cheque in the current circumstances is surely morally untenable, even cowardly.This week Neale Hanvey denounced the SNP as toxic, aggressive and hostile, saying he ldquodetested what the party had become. It would evidently be best policy, perhaps, for all concernedhe makes a clear and irrevocable split with the SNP, putting himself up for re-election on an Alba ticket so he cannot be accused of riding into a job on the coattails of a party he evidently loathes.On a wider stage, matters are currently going very badly for prominent Alba supporters. Craig Murray, a former British diplomat who became a blogger and cheerleader for Alex Salmond, was sentenced to eight months in prison this week for contempt of court relating to the trial of the former First Minister. Judges ruled Murray in contempt relating to material capable of identying four complainers in the case.The future looks shaky too for the nationalist marching organisation All Under One Banner.

Some people who previously took part in the rallies have sworn never to attend again, seeing the organisation tainted by Alba support.Itrsquos also a rather embarrassing time for whatrsquos been termed the lsquoalt-nat blogospherersquo which rallied to Salmondrsquos party. Their role was seen as a major turn-off factor when it came to Alba, with ordinary voters repelled by a toxic mix of conspiracy theories, hate and bigotry.Therersquos speculation that Salmond could have done somewhat better at the polls ndash despite his own low approval ratings ndashhersquod wisely kept clear of such characters.Kenny MacAskillThese online voices are really left with nowhere to go now, but further down the rabbit holes theyrsquove been digging for themselves and their diminishing bands of followers for years. They imagined Nicola Sturgeon ousted from office in the wake of the Salmond inquiries and Alba holding seats in Holyrood. Theyrsquove been repeatedly proved wrong.The more tricky question regarding the aftermath of Alba is what Sturgeon should do about those thorns in her side, and the side of the SNP, who many suspected of planning to jump ship to Alba, but when the crunch came seemingly lacked the courage to defect.Although it was all rumour and zero proof, there was intense speculation MPs Angus MacNeil and Joanna Cherry would defect. Both dismissed the idea.However, previous interventions by Cherry and MacNeil have made le dficult for the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon. Both are seen as having undermined Sturgeonrsquos leadership, and ndash whether they like it or not ndash perceived as central to the long-running civil war within the ranks of the SNP which caused considerable damage to the party.Whatrsquos clear now, though, is that with the defeat of Alba and its rejection by the electorate, Sturgeon is in a strong position to crack down on any dissent in the ranks. It might well become a rather tough season for the SNPrsquos erstwhile awkward squad.There were recent reports that Alex Salmond claimed he could have lsquodestroyedrsquo Nicola Sturgeon. The only thing which has been destroyed is Albarsquos hopes of gaining any traction with the Scottish people. Salmond, however, insists that his party will ldquobloom. The former First Minister is entitled to think what he wishes, but his hopes seem unlikely to be fulfilled. NEIL MACKAY: Salmonds Trumpian circusSalmond is on much firmer ground with his recent warning that ldquoonline warriors are a problem in modern politics. Hersquos undoubtedly correct. So it was a little discomfiting to see him in a online discussion say ndash in jest, it appeared ndash that ldquoone day Irsquom going to unleash myself on Twitter now that Donald Trump has created a vacuum for me.Salmond still casts a long shadow. The husband of one of the women in the Salmond case recently said that the former First Ministerrsquosto the political spotlight had left his we ldquoincapacitated by depression. We must remember Salmond was cleared of all charges.Salmond could change a lothe took just a few simple steps. Apologise for his past behaviour as Nicola Sturgeon has advised him to do, and distance himself from the coterie of extremist voices which surround him. He could also advise the defectors from the SNP to Alba to show the courage of their convictions and face by-election. That way, something may still be salvageable.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The SNP are now only oneseats shy of an overall majority ndash although they will revert to being two shortone of their number becomes the new Presiding Officer today. Together with the Greens, there is a nationalist majority, as there has been since . The Tories remain the second force in Scottish politics, a long way ahead of theLabour party.The verdict of the Scottish people could not have been clearer. We are a ided country, split more or less evenly between nationalists and unionists. To remain so ided appears, for the time being at least, to be our collective settled will.And yet. The clamour for a repeat referendum on independence started before even all the votes were counted, and the noise will only intensy as the weeks unfold. The UK Government is not interested and, instead of talking about mandates and independence and section  orders and all, is trying none too subtly to remain focused on building our recovery from the pandemic and the havoc it has wreaked.:How the Tories became unlikely working class heroes, by Stuart WaitonThis is smart politics. They would be as foolish indefinitely to rule out any repeat referendum as the SNP would be to rush into it. Politicians who say there cannot be another shot at independence for half a century are as likely to be punished by the voters as politicians who say it must all happen by the end of the autumn. What Scots want, as focus group after focus group has shown, is the prospect of a second referendum on the horizon ndash but no closer than that, thank you very much. Even the most enthusiastic Yes voters understand that we have to recover from Covid first.But, evennow is not the time, it does not follow that all the UK Government should do is to sit back and hope that the clock does not tick too fast.There are those who counsel that unionists should just stop talking about it. Let the SNP talk about itthey want to ndash its their project, after all. We unionists, on the other hand, should get on with fixing the backlog in the NHS, with addressing the year of lost schooling, and with the rising tide of unemployment that, one fears, has been delayed rather than reversed by the Treasuryrsquos highly successful furlough scheme.I hear the force of that argument, but I take a dferent view. I think governments can do more than one thing at a time. Our focus should be on the recovery but, at the same time, we do need to start having a more serious conversation about independence than we have had until now. Again, this is what focus groups will tell you.WestminsterA lot of Scots are indy-curious. Itrsquos an interesting and potentially attractive idea, but they want to know much more about it. Their instinct tells them that it will come with costs ndash and their experience of Brexit tells them their instinct is right. Leaving the United Kingdommay or may not be worth it, they think, but we need to know more before we can decide.Indeed, we need to know more before we can be fairly asked to decide.It is true that the UKrsquos union of four home nations is held together by consent. If one part of the UK wishes to withdraw, it has been our constitutional understanding that the other parts will not stand in the way. We are not Spain, held together by force of law. But the consent that holds us together needs to be informed consent. And we know that there are certain key, critical issues that will have to be addressed before we can really understand what we are being asked by the question ldquoshould Scotland be an independent country Top of the list, now as ever, is currency. What would be the currency of an independent Scotland, and how would it work  An old question, but one to which we still donrsquot know the answer.Every bit as pressing is EU accession. We know what the process would be ndash that is set out in the EU treaties. But what would the price be  How would an independent Scotland reshape its economy such that it complied with the Maastricht convergence criteria  There is no question that Scotland could transition to become a Member State ndash of course we could. But, equally, there is no question that it would be a mighty dficult and expensive process. All this needs to be set out and explained, not after any repeat referendum on independence, but before.And then there is the border ndash not just the land border with England but the sea border with Northern Ireland. With Scotland in the EU and theUK out, what consequences for trade, for freedom of movement, for the unhindered supply of services that we all take completely for granted  Brexit may have made the case for independence stronger, to some minds at least, but it has also made the reality of independence far more complex.:Independence must be about changing lives...not flags. So lets hear the visionNow is the time for these questions to come to the fore. The UK Government should start asking them. Ministers should perhaps even commission some trusted independent experts to think about answering them ndash the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, for example  Select committees could open inquiries into these matters, perhaps even joint committees of MPs and MSPs combined  You know, we could even have a citizensrsquo assembly on these topics.It matters less what the process is. It matters more that,Scots are to be asked the independence question again, whether during the course of this parliamentary session or not, we have answers we can trust on the core issues that will be facing us. We need a conversation, not about the aspiration of independence, but about its reality.Adam Tomkins is a Professor of Law at the University of Glasgow.

I had walked by this outcrop for years without noticing them.ldquoOnce I saw the first few, I followed out the ridge of sandstone and realised they were part of a much larger, more extensive trackway.copy -.

They are all on generous plots with good-sized gardens. The site is circa five acres, so we are looking at about three houses per acre.“The houses are entirely within the local plan site which is allocated for housing with an indicative housing capacity of  houses.”When asked what his motivation was for building, he said: “I think Skye post-pandemic is a good market for detached houses, but what we are trying to do is build homes with accessibility to schools and Portree itself.” sought to establish how much the homes would actually cost.Mr Garton Jones said: “We haven#t got that far. Simply because until you have planning permission you don’t have a product.“And the market moves, so a figure now could be out of date in six month’s time. I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3799783.jpg--.jpg?1620807562000\n","title":"canoe crews help clean up banks of the braid","story":"County Antrim Paddle Sportare asking the public ‘canoe help’ to clean up local river banks After a recent litter pick along the Braid River they managed to lt  refuse bags of general litter, three tyres, a plastic oil drum and piping, a bucket, and even a part of a low rider bike!

It truly is a wonderful place and there is nowhere  Id rather be at this stage of Jessicas Journey.”Jessica also asked her mum to share pictures of her with her frame on, saying it will give people the chance to see what she looks like now.Mum Julie recalls the day of surgery, describing it a “bit of a blur” for her.“The Team came to the Ward to see me. Professor Dunaway, the lead surgeon, was smiling, they all were. He said they were finished and all went exceptionally well. I sobbed, happy tears, tears of sheer relief that it was over. He went on to say that there had been absolutely no complications. In fact Jessica had sailed through the surgery. She hadnt even needed a blood transfusion which is almost always a given with this type of surgery. The team advised that it would be another two hours before Jessica would be in recovery.”Julie said those last two hours “were definitely the longest of the day.”“Around pm the nurse took me to recovery, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Jessica bruised, swollen and had wires, tubes and drains everywhere. But there in the middle of it all her little voice said Mummy can I have something to eat,” recalled Julie.Mum explained that over the next seven days they had “good days and not so good days.”“But the staff on the High Dependency Ward were nothing short of amazing. They looked after me as much as they looked after Jessica. They actually made us feel like we were the only family on the ward, They are very special people who go above and beyond every day for families like ours.”Jessica has amazed staff, surgeons and family with her recovery.On Day  Professor Dunaway told Julie in his entire career he has never seen a recovery like it, describing it as “amazing.”“I replied Our God is amazing, it really has been nothing short of a miracle,” said Julie.As the week progressed the Surgical Team gradually informed Julie of what they had done in theatre.They explained that because Jessica was coping so well under the anaesthetic, they decided to do a little bit extra to ensure that Jessica had the best possible outcome from the surgery.“They didnt just fit the frame as planned, they bone grafted her a new nose, they gave her a cheek lt and plated her forehead. So, in light of all of this it made her recovery even more of a miracle,” smiled Julie“It also re-iterated to me that these surgeons are very special people, who go above and beyond on a daily basis for children like Jessica. They want the very best for them and they will do everything in their power to improve their quality of le. Thank you just doesnt go far enough, we will be eternally grateful to that Team.”Husband Lawrie was able to join Jessica and Julie for the weekend - “to help us with the move”, quipped Julie.“We’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of ‘stuff’ over the last seven days, but it was horrible having to say goodbye.”Julie reports that Jessica has started to eat and drink more orally so not requiring as many tube feeds, swelling is going down gradually and continuing to improve daily!Regarding her frame, the screws will be turned twice a day for the next few weeks, gradually changing the shape of Jessica’s face.Mum Julie is always very mindful to thank all those who have sent texts, cards gts and prayed for them.“It has been absolutely amazing and were so thankful to have the first week done with no major complications. As someone said to me ‘first week done , a road never to be traveled again’.“It was tough, there were tears . There were good days, there were not so good days but we’ve done it and know that God was with us and will continue to be with us in the days and weeks ahead,” said Julie.And Julie makes no secret of the fact that faith has got her through this very challenging time.“Obviously our faith has been a major factor in how we, as a family, have been able to cope with all of this. And the outpouring of prayer, practical and emotional support from our own church, Ballyloughan Presbyterian, Connor Presbyterian where Jessica attends GB and Youth Club and Woodlands Presbyterian in Carrick who have adopted us, along with many other churches and iniduals from every denomination has been special. And we would like to thank everyone whos been praying and offering practical support, it has meant so much to us and it has been wonderful to see so many people being the church.”Julie said they had every faith in the Surgical Team, and “and more importantly we knew that Jessica and that team were covered in prayer leading up to and for the duration of the surgery. Churches of all denominations, iniduals and groups of people from all faiths had prayer rotas going throughout the day, and so we had a peace about this surgery from the outset.”Indeed, a verse of scripture that was very poignant in the week leading up to this surgery was Isaiah : -  So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God, I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.“This verse was in my head as I walked out of the anaesthetic room that morning, it was the most dficult thing I have ever had to do. But I knew that God was in complete control and would carry Jessica, the team and me through that day and in the days to come,”said Julie.The Jessicas Journey Facebook and Instagram pages have been a real source of encouragement to them as a family over the last couple of weeks.“We currently have .K followers and so I think we have achieved our aim of raising awareness of Craniofacial conditions. The comments, well wishes, prayers and support of thousands of people on the page have carried us through the dark days - thank you to each and every person whos taken the time to comment or message, you really have made a dference and you have restored our faith in humanity,” concluded Julie.

My son’s wedding is going ahead and I accept the consequences of not taking it down.”Ms Neary, a solicitor in the legal department of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, said after the injunction application that the council would be moving immediately to take the marquee down or hire an independent contractor to do the work for it.Judge Ní Chulacháin said she noticed from photographs of the marquee taken by Mr Donovan that there were  tables surrounded by chairs in the marquee, enough chairs to accommodate more than  people.Mr Flynn told the court the council considered the planned reception to be a breach of Covid- regulations in the middle of a global pandemic as well as breaking a tenancy agreement. The local authority was also concerned about the lack of insurance cover for this evening’s event.Judge Ní Chulacháin gave the council leave to serve personal notice on Mr Connors and also pin up notices outlining details of the court’s orders. The judge also directed that everyone associated with the reception, including the bridal party and guests, be warned they had been restrained from entering the marquee.Mr Flynn indicated that the council had signicant concerns relating to the use of the marquee for the wedding reception which, he said, unless restrained by the court the Connors planned to go ahead with..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Independent.ieMost ReadBody of Northern Ireland woman Suzanne Knowles missing in Spain is foundArmagh newlyweds’ parents ordered to remove marquee ahead of Dublin wedding receptionDUP’s Donaldson slammed for claims he will risk Stormont collapse over NI protocol protestBallymurphy massacre relatives urge Boris Johnson to say sorry in public rejecting his ‘third-party’ apologyDUP’s Donaldson takes swipe at Poots vowing to ‘vigorously oppose’ NI protocol and further disrupt North-South relationsTop VideosPlayUK Government apology #bare minimum# for Ballymurphy familiesPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlaySchoolboy makes incredible recovery from polio-like virusLatest Northern IrelandPrime Minister’s letter to Ballymurphy families ‘unacceptable’Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling average‘Now we’re sucking diesel’ Line of Duty stars overjoyed with record ratings‘The Wee Donkey’ and ‘Ats us nai’ ...

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, says that as a working class movement DTUC has provided a voice for workers and social justice campaigns. It aims to further reach out with the launch of a local workers survey, as it extends its solidarity with the people of Derry and District demanding an end to the many hardships which workers and their families experience and have experienced for far too long. Mr McCarroll says: Like everyone  I have listened to plenty of guff over the years. Hang in there is the message from all sections of the establishment, we are sympathetic and very empathetic we know things are dficult butyou keep working for nothing with no improvements things will improve. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, hotel workers, health care assistants, nursing home workers, shop workers, classroom assistants, retail workers, community, voluntary sector workers and indeed call centre staff have all heard this and still they wait, we all wait. We need to organise and begin to direct our own affairs, we need to represent ourselves because we are not being represented. He adds: Derry Trades Union Council call upon all local workers to join a trade union, get active in your local branch and shape your trade union into a fighting, working class organisation. This is how we will change our lives make our communities better, create a culture of solidarity across all workplaces, uniting all workers. Lets begin to create this new modern workers movement. googletag.cmd.push Unionised workers of the past, including our local factory workers championed the cause of labour and won many of the rights we take for granted today such as maternity pay,  hour days and weekends off. Todays demands are not being won, workers need decent pay and we must collectively mobilise to end the scourge of poverty pay, creating the situation were no worker needs to work two jobs to survive. By completing the DTUC survey we can commence the call to mobilise, use this survey to bring us together - together we can make a dference - together we can deliver for each other.     We are told by the privileged few that we must wait to gain the same privileges. Time is up.

It aims to further reach out with the launch of a local workers survey, as it extends its solidarity with the people of Derry and District demanding an end to the many hardships which workers and their families experience and have experienced for far too long. Mr McCarroll says: Like everyone  I have listened to plenty of guff over the years. Hang in there is the message from all sections of the establishment, we are sympathetic and very empathetic we know things are dficult butyou keep working for nothing with no improvements things will improve. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, hotel workers, health care assistants, nursing home workers, shop workers, classroom assistants, retail workers, community, voluntary sector workers and indeed call centre staff have all heard this and still they wait, we all wait. We need to organise and begin to direct our own affairs, we need to represent ourselves because we are not being represented. He adds: Derry Trades Union Council call upon all local workers to join a trade union, get active in your local branch and shape your trade union into a fighting, working class organisation. This is how we will change our lives make our communities better, create a culture of solidarity across all workplaces, uniting all workers. Lets begin to create this new modern workers movement. googletag.cmd.push Unionised workers of the past, including our local factory workers championed the cause of labour and won many of the rights we take for granted today such as maternity pay,  hour days and weekends off. Todays demands are not being won, workers need decent pay and we must collectively mobilise to end the scourge of poverty pay, creating the situation were no worker needs to work two jobs to survive. By completing the DTUC survey we can commence the call to mobilise, use this survey to bring us together - together we can make a dference - together we can deliver for each other.     We are told by the privileged few that we must wait to gain the same privileges. Time is up. The survey can be completed by visitinghttps:forms.gle  cBPhvHxEQFPMw   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I got chatting to him and thats how I got involved with Sinn Feacutein in our area. Learning about British influence in Ireland and all the damage that had done, and the hurt and pain that had been caused through the generations as a result, I could see Irish unity as the solution. Thats what I became focused on the reunication of the country and seeing this place recognised as it should be, in my view. googletag.cmd.push  LT: What has been your biggest achievement  ES: I would say the wins for people on the ground. When somebody contacts you about a care package, or a big pothole outside their house which is a safety issue, those are the biggest wins. If someone comes to you with a problem that is causing them anxiety, and you can do something that gets that sorted, the sense of satisfaction is great.  LT: And your biggest challenge  ES: It really winds me up when we get compared to the DUP and characterised as a green version. We are polar opposites in every way. googletag.cmd.push Were a left-wing progressive party, but we get characterised as another version of the DUP, and that easy narrative is completely inaccurate. Were not opposed to the British monarchy because of iniduals within the British royal family, were opposed to it because it sets one group of people above everyone .  LT: You were co-opted in  for Ian Milne. Your first election campaign will be coming up – are you excited or apprehensive  ES: Elections are always an interesting time, there is high pressure, hard work and long days, but Im relishing the opportunity to get out and get chatting to people.     The idea of getting involved in the discussion is one thing, the idea of being up for election itself is obviously daunting. Im there as a member of an incredible team. We have  class councillors in Mid Ulster, so its not like Im going in without support. Emma Sheerin with fellow Mid Ulster MLAs Michelle ONeill and Linda Dillon. LT: As a young woman in politics, have you faced any online abuse from anonymous trolls  ES: I do get troll accounts and faceless people. I remember the night I was selected and people were on social media congratulating me and welcoming me to the MLA team. This one person put up a meme of a wee pig running around with the caption oh great, another pig in a skirt. I cracked up laughing. get more frustrated on social media when its people that I know parroting out something that isnt true than I would be about faceless accounts calling me names.  LT: Youre the Equality Spokesperson for Sinn Feacutein. Did it sit comfortably for you abstaining in the recent vote on the Severe Foetal Impairment Bill in the Assembly  ES: We had a lot of conversations about how to handle that, and the reason we abstained was because the British government had made it very clear that they were going to uphold the law in the North. We knew this bill, whilst making its way through the Assembly, wasnt actually going to affect any material change, because the British government were going to overturn it. The DUP were playing politics. They used sensationalised versions of peoples stories to make political gains and appeal to a certain base. If we were going to start voting for or trying to amend, we would be engaging with them. The people that are affected by this issue have been traumatised enough and we didnt want to see that carry on. The debate has been had, the law has been set in order to be human rights compliant. Its a very sensitive issue and people have very strong feelings on one side or the other.  LT: Youre rooted in South Derry. How dficult is it to balance the constituency work with Stormont business  ES: It can be trying at times, because when Stormont is running at full tilt, its fairly full-on. At the minute, the schedule is cut slightly, but outside of Coronavirus, you could be here til ,, at night. Youre trying to fit in chasing up constituency stuff around that and then on a Friday, youre in the constituency, but youre trying to meet with groups and organisations too.  LT: Until a few weeks ago, three of the main parties had female leaders. Do you think Arlene Foster was unfairly treated by those within her party  ES: Arlene herself, in the cut and thrust of politics, was never a progressive. She was never out there leading from the front, trying to break the glass ceiling for women. I would be fearful of where the DUP are going next, but Arlene didnt vote to ban conversion therapy, she just abstained. On the surface, it looks like Arlene got a raw deal but we didnt see massive steps for progression under her stewardship. Emma Sheerin says Arlene has done little to help the cause of women in politics. LT: Sinn Feacutein have had dficulties in Derry City over the last few weeks. Does it leave a possibility they could concede further ground to the SDLP in Foyle  ES: We would have election reviews in every area and I really dont know how we saw such a big loss in Derry two years ago. We cant worry about what anyone  is doing, we focus on ourselves. We wouldnt like to pre-empt what the results would be in a years time but we hope totwo Sinn Feacutein MLAs in Derry. I know Karen and Martina are hard, hard workers and have been active on the ground. Obviously the results weve had have shown weve had problems and that has led to the decision.  LT: Finally, is there anything youre hoping to achieve in the remainder of this term  ES: Im working on a Private Members Bill at the minute around gender budgeting. Its about identying decision making for the government in the North where they dont factor women in. You end up with these sort of systemic, built-in inequalities from a starting point, so its trying to tackle that at root cause so outcomes are more likely to be equal. The impact of Covid- on women has shown up they are more than likely to carry the burden of domestic responsiblities or caring responsibilities. We want to fix that imbalance  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I know Karen and Martina are hard, hard workers and have been active on the ground. Obviously the results weve had have shown weve had problems and that has led to the decision.  LT: Finally, is there anything youre hoping to achieve in the remainder of this term  ES: Im working on a Private Members Bill at the minute around gender budgeting. Its about identying decision making for the government in the North where they dont factor women in. You end up with these sort of systemic, built-in inequalities from a starting point, so its trying to tackle that at root cause so outcomes are more likely to be equal. The impact of Covid- on women has shown up they are more than likely to carry the burden of domestic responsiblities or caring responsibilities. We want to fix that imbalance  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year more than ever, it is important to celebrate the incredible contributions that nurses make to our society. One such inidual who deserves a special mention is Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist Margaret Carlin who was named Cancer Nurse of the Year  at the Royal College of Nursing Awards NI. Margaret is from Magherafelt and is based at Antrim Area Hospital. She has been caring for local people for almost  years and has just retired from her full-time post. googletag.cmd.push Margaret took up her role as a Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialist in the Mid Ulster Hospital in . “My post was created as a result of collaboration between Macmillan Cancer Support and what is now the Northern Health and Social Care Trust,” recalls Margaret. “It was important to have a full-time nurse specialist who could provide expert advice, support and information to patients who were living with cancer or a le limiting illness.” Following Margaret’s appointment, her sterling work in the community was well known. Funds, however, were needed to continue to support her role and this inspired a group of iniduals in the Magherafelt area to form a fundraising committee. googletag.cmd.push In their time, Magherafelt Fundraising Committee raised over pound,, pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support in Northern Ireland. “Over the years I have met and cared for many people with cancer and other le limiting conditions, often at times of great distress for them, their families and loved ones,” explains Margaret. “They have allowed me into their lives and to be with them throughout their illness. They have shared their thoughts and feelings with me and told me about their hopes and fears for the future. We laughed together and sometimes we cried together. “Throughout the years, I continue to meet people who I met at the time when they were diagnosed with cancer.     “I am always glad to see them and it makes me really happy to see the quality of le they continue to have. I also meet many families whose loved ones I cared for, who sadly have died, and I am always touched that they remember me and the times we spent together. “They tell me about their lives now and changes there have been. “They tell me how their children and grandchildren have grown up and are doing well and this reminds me that I will always be part of their memories and how privileged I am to be a Macmillan nurse.” Margaret initially trained as a nursing student in Mid Ulster Hospital from - and following this worked as a staff nurse in the Mid Ulster Hospital. It was in October  that she became a Macmillan nurse, delivering chemotherapy to patients as well as helping to set up and establish palliative care services. In , Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital as Macmillan Lung Cancer Nurse Specialist. “Since Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital, she has worked tirelessly to raise the standards of the care delivered to patients diagnosed with lung cancer,” explains Sally Convery, Macmillan Service Lead for Palliative Care. “Margaret is passionate about caring for the inidual and is very focused on ensuring patients are recognised as people and not by their diagnosis. “She encourages them to focus on the positive aspects of le and not on their diagnosis. Margaret is an excellent role model to the other lung cancer nurses and demonstrates her passion for ensuring safe and effective care. “She continually strives to improve the patient’s quality of le and has shown outstanding commitment to the creation and delivery of a pulmonary prehabilitation self-management programme for patients with lung cancer. “Margaret believes it is important services are delivered with patients and relatives at the forefront and because of this she is involved in and promotes ious lung cancer support groups in the area as well as co-ordinating a support group that is regularly reviewed by patients. “As well as this, she has driven forward a campaign to increase the awareness of lung cancer symptoms and has lead a team of her colleagues to visit local shopping centres and share leaflets ensuring members of the public are aware of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer. She is always looking at ways to get the message out there in innovative ways.” Sally continued: “Margaret is a wonderful resource of expert knowledge and she has certainly shown outstanding leadership in cancer and palliative care for almost  years’ service. “We are delighted that she has agreed tofor a short time following her retirement to ensure the service continues to deliver high quality care and we wish her the very best in her future, we will miss her.” Margaret concluded: “Although I have officially retired from my full-time post, I will continue in my role as a Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist two days a week for another year. “I will really miss my colleagues and all the people that I have met and cared for over the years.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a day when injury time was a game all of its own. Derrys plight was outside their own hands. News of Down trailing in Cork filtered through to Brewster Park where Carlus McWilliams stoppage time point grabbed victory. But it wasnt enough. Jerome Johnston saved Down with a thminute equaliser. Derrys inferior score dference saw them drop below Clare and Down, to the drop zone, and out of the top half of Irelands football rankings. Of the six teams in Division  that weekend, Dublin, Kerry, Donegal, Tyrone and Monaghan remain there. Since then, Derry have dropped to Division , bounced back and fell victim to a horrendous start last season that keeps them in Irelands bottom half. googletag.cmd.push If eight team leagues arent competitive enough, Derry are stepping into the fire this weekend, in the Covid- induced four-team leagues. In the distance, Fermanagh and Ulster champions Cavan come down the tracks, but Saturdays trip to Longford will tell a lot in a -day period that will define Derrys season. Mention Longford to any Derry fan, and it will generate that sickening feeling in the pit of their stomach. Digging deeper, since the turn of the millennium, the sides have played eight times in league and championship, with Derry winning three of them. Of the five Derry played on their travels, you have to go back to a  All-Ireland series for their only win. It was a day when current Longford manager Padraic Davis kicked six points, as Derry hammered them in just the second year of the qualiers, thanks to two Anthony Tohill goals. googletag.cmd.push More recently Derry tanked them at Celtic Park last year, but they were without experienced trioMichael Quinn, Barry McKeon and David McGivney. Speaking to the County Derry Post last week, Rory Gallagher reported an almost clean bill of health. An impact knee injury, sustained in a clash at training, leaves Conor McCluskey the only one of this -strong squad doubtful. Karl McKaigue, Ruairi Mooney and Jack Doherty, bar the latters McKenna Cup appearance in Gallaghers first game in Inniskeen, missed all of . The trio are in contention for a start this weekend. Gareth McKinless, who starred for Ballinderry in the last two championships, withdrew from the county scene at the start of  with plans to go travelling. After expressing a desire to , he is back in the fold.     In the off-season, Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers had knee operations, after years of wear and tear, with Padraig Cassidy going through a rehabilitation programme on a troublesome hip injury. There is a greater consistency to the . Of the  players Rory Gallagher gave inter-county debuts to last year, only Eoghan Duffy and Alex Doherty are no longer on the . Of the current squad, only newcomers Conleth McShane and his Bellaghy teammate Ronan McFaul have yet to make their debut. The championship will take care of itself when it comes around. Before that, its hard to imagine it even being discussed in the group. Getting off to a winning start is the only show in town. Momentum is sports most useful tool. With it, so much of everything  follows. Derry are well-placed. Having almost everyone fit for selection is one plus. The squad are in tip top shape and there has to be positives from elements of the Armagh performance in last years championship. Defensively, there are vast improvements to be made. With McKinless in the mix and with Karl McKaigue ing, it will create more competition and with it, the standards will rise. Thats the first improvement. Those early exchanges left Armagh playing the game on their own terms. Any shot Longford get away this weekend, will need to be under more than token pressure. Longford have only failed to hit the net in six of the  games under Padraic Davis in the last two seasons. Secondly, getting a medium to long-range kick-out option is another thing Derry need to find. Working the ball out short is okay to an extent, but it is energy sapping and doesnt ask enough questions of the opposition. Half the Derry squad come from Glen , Slaughtneiland Magherafelt , teams with their goalkeepers going short more often than not. A more ied Derry at midfield, will give them so many more options up front. This is where many of the gains are to be had, but it plonks responsibility on Emmett Bradley and the untested Conor Glass. Yes, the former minor captain was a professional athlete, but he has been away from the game for the last five years. Thirdly, in attack, Shane McGuigan is the star of the show and getting him a regular wing-man up front is a must. If Derry can improve in these three areas, they can go one better than last season and gain promotion. But it will be far from easy.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McKaigue has received the all-clear and has been involved in some of the football in recent weeks.Speaking last week, Gallagher feels McKaigue probably hasnt had the amount of football under his belt for the start of the league, with the management erring on the side of caution with histo action.“We believe he will be fully fit and available for the Longford game,” added the Derry boss who termed McKaiguesas brilliant news.“One thing for sure, his Achilles is  percent recovered,” Gallagher stated. “Will he pick up another setback  I dont believe he will, he looks in great nick but he just needs plenty of football.”Meanwhile, Gallagher is happy that another Slaughtneil duo, Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers, are back going well after going under the kne for knee injuries.Gallagher revealed that both were fortunate to feature in last Autumns Ulster championship defeat to Armagh.“They have had a lot of wear and tear over the last five, six, seven years, but they are back going well...they look after themselves phenomenally,” Gallagher added.“They were meniscus injuries, needing eight to nine weeks to recover. Theyplayed the latter stages of the club championship, the two National League gamesand the championship against Armagh, thats the type of characters we want.”Midfielder Padraig Cassidy was also playing through a niggly hip injury over the past few seasons for club and county. There were reports of surgery being required in the long-term and he managed his progress with injections, but Derry are boosted by his full recovery, having also been given the all clear at a clinic in Santry, following his rehabilitation programme.“Hehas worked phenomenally hard, often twice a day, and he is injury free,” Gallagher said of Cassidys progress. “He is totally injury free and moving really well. That is a massive plus as well.”Glens Jack Doherty, apart from a brief appearance in the McKenna Cup defeat to Monaghan in December , missed all of Derrys  season and Gallagher is happy to have him back in the selection mix.“He is fully fit and injury free. He looks good and is moving really well, has been able to do all the work and looks in good shape.”Ruairi Mooney also missed all of last season and Shea Downey, one of  players handed their inter-county senior debuts by Gallagher, are also back in full training.Gallagher stated that he had no long-term injuries in the -man squad, with Magherafelt defender Conor McCluskey the only one on the doubtful list for this weekend.“Clucky got a collision on his knee at training. It is not too serious, it might be a slight doubt at this stage,” he said.Ballinderry utility player Gareth McKinless, who withdrew from the  early in , is back in the fold after reaching out to the management to express his interest in a .“Since we agreed to move forward, Gareth has put the head down and I have been very pleased with his level of performance.“Gareth phoned us telling us he wanted to play, that is a good sign and we are delighted to have him.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With new movie Stealth due to premiere before the end of this month, the company is currently working on Grief, a film detailing the pain and loss caused by the Covid- pandemic. The second instalment of Long Shot, entitled Long Shot’s Letter, is also due for completion. After Grief is shot and edited by mid-June, its on to West Banksy which will deal with drug addiction and abuse. googletag.cmd.push The groups alternative news programme, It’s News To Me, will be launched in September and it is hoped three more short films by the end of the year, one of which will focus on bullying in the secondary sector. Joseph McCarthy, writer, director and producer with Black North, which he founded, said: “We have already sourced school ties and shirts and will need to source jumpers, trousers and skirts too. “In between times, we will complete the third part of our Troubles’ Trilogy, so we will be very busy for some time. We will also be casting for new members when the lockdown lts.” googletag.cmd.push Joseph said Black North Productions was formed to get the message out there that the North of Ireland is not a place to avoid, not a place of hate and despair. He added: “The North of Ireland is a beautul place, populated by friendly people who have been trapped by history that is not of our making. We aim to show the positive aspects of Northern Ireland, that is second to no other place in artistic talent.” Joe explained how Black North came into being. “We came about due to a marked lack of opportunity for people who had artistic ability, but in essence no real outlet. I began writing poetry and plays some years ago and I wrongly assumed that long established arts venues would nurture new talent.     “A good example of this was when I tried to get one of my plays performed in the city. I approached the then chief executive of that venue and spoke with a  of their governing body regarding getting some assistance to have my play produced. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that there was an insular attitude and mercenary outlook, which left me both surprised and disappointed. “Needless to say, I have had no contact with either that venue or those art experts since. It’s interesting to note, that the play I approached them with which was called Enough is Enough won the University of Ulster’s Greer Garson Award for Theatre soon after that meeting. I formed the impression that I was being grilled on that occasion and that in itself, was an unpleasant experience. “I came up with idea of forming Black North Productions and at that particular time, the North of Ireland was being avoided by many people from the Republic of Ireland and the UK. The Nordies were cast in a dark light that we simply did not deserve to be in that position. I set out to show that we in the North, and in particular our city, can produce poetry, plays and short films that can be deemed as artistic works of the highest quality. “There was never any formal meeting or expressions of interest highlighted at that time. I came up with idea, developed the idea, enlisted the help of others who were of the same mind-set, both regarding the attitudes of outsiders to the North of Ireland and the dismal lack of assistance that prevailed in the city and unfortunately still does to a large extent.” Black Norths first film was Wish You Were Here. Joe explained its storyline: “It revolved around a writer played by Greta McTeague, who whilst writing a detective novel gets, side-tracked by the historic events that have happened in the city. The film opens in  and in her mind she imagines she is speaking with the people from that time. The central character is the likeable and fair- minded Michael Quinlivan. I intended to produce a Trouble’s Trilogy moving from  to  and then to present day. “The theme was in essence about the Trouble’s children, who lived through that period, suffered so much and yet seamlessly formed bonds with total strangers who shared the same experiences and through those experience formed bonds that still exist today.” To date, Black North has made six films – as well as Wish You Were Here, there has been Right Reasons For Wrong, Long Shot, F-, Unlucky Lucky and andSnowflake Generation. Joseph added: “We will premiere Stealth by the end of the month and have quite a lot of work completed on our final Troubles film, Half Ticket No Return. but due to such a large cast and the urrent restrictions, we have had to put that one onhold.” Joseph said Stealth was a really interesting piece. He added: “It is set in both present day and the future and shows our technical abilities and innovations through an intriguing storyline that will make people sit up and think. It is very much an Orwellian piece with a modern twist.” Black North is currently working on Grief, telling the story of loss due to the pandemic. Joe said it came about for a number of reasons. He added: “Having known so many people who have lost loved ones and listened to their heart-wrenching stories of not getting to say that final goodbye, or to be there when they felt they were most needed, made me feel that there needs to be some kind of closure. A chance to say that final farewell.” Joseph conceded the films topic was dficult topic to deal with it. He said: “As we all know, Covid- has had a devastating effect on so many people and has brought entire countries to a standstill. “It was a dficult topic to deal with in a sensitive and constructive way, I have done my best to alleviate the sense of loss and hurt that this terrible virus has caused. “I really hope that we, as a team, have done that. From our extras, who will play mourners, to the bikers who will escort the coffin into the city, to our choir and central characters played by Jamie Coll, Chantel Carlin, Gabriel White, Kieran Dallas, Corey Hanna and Dean O’Donnell, I really hope we have.” So, how did the bikers become involved  Joseph explained: “Gerry McGeady, a leading light with Centurions MC, is the main man when it came to organising bikers. “Gerry is a well-respected biker of many years and has strong connections to the world of bikers and, in particular, the local clubs. “I have to thank him for all his efforts in bringing together a dedicated bunch of bikers in the form of The Exiles RC and The Centurions MCC. “The bikers are a great team to work with and they are keen to become involved in Grief as they too understand the immense sense of loss felt by so many people.” Joseph said Black Norths was very proud of its wide range of cast members. He said: “The pandemic has made casting for parts very dficult for us, but we have done our best to continue to bring in new members and Grief will comprise of several new member and a younger cast. “Quite often, a member will suggest a family member who would suit a part or a friend or relative and once we give that person a piece to perform and have a chat with him her, we then film them and take it from there. “We are proud of our wide and ied cast members. “We have people from all backgrounds such as: bricklayers, plasterers, council workers, accountants, health care workers, secondary school pupils, students, basically from every walk of le. “Some people were hesitant and lacked confidence, those same people are now much more confident and outgoing. “Indeed, this has been one of greatest achievements to date, to see people develop and grow in confidence, people who would never have had an opportunity to become involved in film.”                                         --  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fairhill and Plantin areas of Draperstown are set for a major overhaul as part of the scheme, with the latter having been plagued by anti social behaviour in recent years. Sinn Feacutein councillor for the area, Catherine Ellatar, has said she hopes the work will be the first step in ing the Plantin to its former glory. “Unfortunately the Plantin has a long history of anti social behaviour,” she said. “I would love for that to change and for people and especially our young people to see it as a communal resource that we can all spend time in, enjoy nature and be proud of. googletag.cmd.push “Vandalism destroys this area for everyone in the village and the cost of repairs has to be met by local rate payers, who are the parents and grandparents of those causing the damage. “They should think of our local area as an extension of their homes and treat it and local residents with the respect and kindness they would expect to be treated with themselves. “I realise the pandemic has meant that young people have not been able to get out and take part in the sporting and social activities they would usually do, over the past year. “I would encourage them to see themselves as the important part of our local community that they are and join with us all in contributing to the great community spirit that exists in Ballinascreen.” googletag.cmd.push The Fairhill is a historic site in the centre of Draperstown, and Cllr Ellatar is hoping it can become a valuable part of the village once again. “The Fairhill has been in a state of disrepair for some time and its great to see work starting to make it a valuable part of the village again,” she said. “It used to be where the sheep sales took place and on a market day, it was a central part of the village. It will be lovely to see it being used again by residents and visitors. “Council officers and our local Sinn Feacutein team have worked hard to secure a lease for the Fairhill and the funding to carry out the work to it and to the Plantin.     “We live in a beautul part of the Sperrins and over recent years we have seen a lot of visitors to the area and hopefully that will continue. “Our local businesses are opening up again and I’m sure would welcome more visitors and potential customers.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Strong partnership working, sharing information and joined up messaging are key across the North West was the message from the Mayors of Derry City, Strabane and Donegal, attending a meeting to discuss the Covid- response in the region. The meeting this week was co-chaired by the two Mayors, Cllr Brian Tierney Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council and An Cathaoirleach Cllr Rena Donaghey of Donegal County Council It was set up to discuss the cross border approach to the COVID  rates across the North West. googletag.cmd.push It was attended by the Chair and Vice Chair of the North West Regional Development Group, Cllr Sandra Duffyand Cllr Ciaran Brogan , as well as the Chief Executives of Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council, John Kelpie and John McLaughlin, along with senior Council officials from both Councils. Those attending the meeting were provided with details of the current Covid- infection rates across their respective Council areas and heard about the proactive work being done by both Councils to support the statutory agencies in responding to the pandemic and how they are adapting services and providing support as the NW reopens at the ying stages of recovery. googletag.cmd.push While concern was expressed at the high infection rate in both Council areas, there was general acknowledgement that compliance was high across the region with the majority of the public adhering to the guidelines and taking all the necessary steps in order to keep each other safe. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Cllr Brian Tierney said the region faced challenges as a result of the iance in the lting of restrictions but that he was confident people on both sides of the border were acting responsibly. He thanked the public for their commitment and support to date urging them to continue to make good decisions.     As the restrictions are lted gradually on both sides of the border, he said it is important everyone continues to act cautiously and adhere to the messages around social distancing, wearing face coverings and regular hand sanitisation. He said: The people of the North West have been amazing throughout this pandemic. They have rallied around one another and supported each other in dficult times. However, its important that we understand that Covid hasnt gone away – its still here and its still spreading. Its still important that we dont let our guard down that we continue to look out for one another. There are small things we can do to protect each other – when we are out walking and see friends we must stand back and keep a distance, when we are going to the shops we must remember to take our face masks and our hand sanitiser and give other customers some space. An Cathaoirleach Cllr Rena Donaghey acknowledged the huge amount of work being done by the two councils, the statutory agencies and health bodies on both sides of the border. She said the strong partnership approach and collaborative work to respond to the Covid- numbers in the region was key in reducing the rate of infection. She said the roll out of the vaccination programmes was hugely positive in providing hope for the future and that all this was good news in providing support to businesses as the Councils work together to rebuild the NW economy. Cllr Donaghey said: We are a region that relies on one another. We have strong family and business connections and our lives are intertwined in everything that we do. It is important therefore in the days ahead and coming weeks and that we avoid attributing blame but work together towards a common goal of protecting our communities from this virus. The people of Donegal, Derry and Strabane are one community, we look out for one another and support one another through thick and thin. Lets continue to do that and work together to keep each other safe so that we can look forward to a better future for all of us. It was agreed at the meeting that the Councils and statutory agencies would continue to share information and work collectively in the weeks and months ahead as the North West region takes small cautious steps towards recovery.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister.

Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year.

Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run.

Ireland did not hesitate to police the border when it thought it appropriate.Yet Northern Ireland is, in effect, not allowed to police the border in , even when we are far ahead on vaccinations.Stormont should today confirm the May  reopening of outlets such as restaurants, and outline a clear route to changes in mixing of households, travel and tourism, including the essentialof free movement within the Common Travel Area.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He married Janet, a NHS nurse, and they had a wonderful daughter Rhinna, whom he absolutely adored.Sadly, during the last couple of years his health had deteriorated, though he made brave efforts to carry on trying to help the struggling rugby club. At the end of October he had a stroke while driving his car and ended up in hospital, where the Covid- lockdown prevented him from seeing his family for several months, which left him very upset and both Janet and Rhinna heartbroken. ldquoHe lost ten stones in weight and seemed to have aged  years in  days, explained his daughter.Thankfully, he was determined to see his loved ones and say goodbye, as Rhinna explained, so he resolutely battled against the odds, making sure he was able to see them by the end of April when the lockdown was relaxed.ldquoHe has waited for us,\" said Rhinna. \"We went to see him and mum said that he was waiting for us and his brother Keith to say goodbye.There is very little doubt Penarth RFC will never be the same without Stu Davies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Prof Wroblewski said: ldquoWhen I found them, it was late afternoon and the setting sun hit them at just the right angle to make them visible on the tilted slabs of sandstone.ldquoAt first, I couldnrsquot believe what I was seeing.

Jemma McGowan, , was given the nightmare news that her chemotherapy would be stopped after medics found new tumours in her pelvic area and pubic bone on Monday. After researching alternative therapy to try and prolong her le, she is planning to travel to Mexico - but she needs at least pound, to do so. On Thursday morning, over pound, had been raised on her Go Fund Me page. In an update, Jemma said: My husband Clive and I have been just so overwhelmed by the generosity of family and friends and the whole community over the past few days. It really has brought a sense of hope back to me since I got my scan results on Monday, to have not only achieved my target figure but surpassed it by an insane amount - my miracle. I have received thousands of messages from people that are in similar situations, people that have battled and are winning as well as family members of the unlucky victims of this indiscriminate disease. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone that has donated, shared my story and prayed for me and my family, I am truly blessed to have had this unimaginable support in such a short period of time. Hopefully in the next few days I will know a timeframe of the next stage of my journey.
