[{"url":null,"title":"Governments scientists Covid spread China meeting","story":"Share this article But the panel stood firm and said: \u0027Providing information to travellers and providing effective means for screening febrile travellers attending healthcare settings was likely to be a better option.\u0027 Professor Ferguson, who was one of the experts behind the terrifying Imperial College London projections that spooked No10 into Britain\u0027s first lockdown in March, claimed that modelling suggested the benefit would be \u0027low\u0027.He said it would only detect travellers who were not sick before boarding a flight but became ill during the journey. This is because it can take patients several days before they show any signs of being ill. Minutes from the second meeting on January 21 also show that \u0027NERVTAG felt there was a lack of clarity on the exit screening process in Wuhan\u0027.But the group assumed China was stopping travellers with a fever from departing the nation because of statements released by local authorities. And they said it would have little effect – even if Beijing\u0027s bureaucrats weren\u0027t doing it.Dr James Rubin, a psychologist at King\u0027s College London, also warned that screening could lead to \u0027stigma\u0027 for travellers. Documents say: \u0027It was noted that port of entry screening in the UK would be a significant undertaking, especially as fever may not be a very sensitive method of identifying cases.\u0027Fever wasn\u0027t mooted as a symptom until January 30 – the day after the first two coronavirus patients were diagnosed on British soil. Members \u0027largely agreed\u0027 it was a sign of the disease.NERVTAG also said that direct flights out of Wuhan would not be the only way to travel out of the affected area and that the outbreak zone \u0027appears to be expanding\u0027.At the third meeting on January 28, the experts discussed widening the \u0027case definition\u0027 of a Covid patient – a set of criteria to classify whether someone really has Covid.Department of Health bosses warned keeping it just to patients who had been to Wuhan – which had already banned all flights and trains from leaving the city – was inconsistent with the reality of the \u0027changing geographical spread of the virus\u0027.Data at the time revealed there were at least 30 provinces in China with confirmed cases of WN-CoV – the place-holder name for the coronavirus before it was eventually given a title in early February.NERVTAG said \u0027expanding the case definition to the whole of mainland China at this moment in time was not feasible and did not seem appropriate with the information at hand\u0027.But they agreed it should include the whole of Hubei – which is home to around 60million people – and a wider number of provinces. The list of affected areas should be kept under review, NERVTAG also said.Just two days later at the fourth meeting, the group U-turned on their advice and accepted it was \u0027necessary\u0027 to include all of mainland China on the case definition list.Minutes from the meeting say: \u0027Following a short discussion, NERVTAG agreed with DHSC on expansion of the geographical element of the case definition to include the whole of mainland China.\u0027Professor Chris Whitty also said that \u0027feedback\u0027 and the \u0027evolving nature\u0027 of the crisis meant that it would be better to slap the whole country on the list, instead of just a handful of provinces. Professor Van-Tam also argued that any Britons with tell-tale symptoms of Covid who were seeking to be repatriated from China should not be allowed to board an organised flight back to the UK.During the same meeting, NERVTAG said there was \u0027no evidence\u0027 to support that wearing face masks cuts the risk of spreading the virus.  China denies entry to team of WHO experts due to investigate the origins of Covid-19 pandemic amid growing suspicions of a cover-upChina has denied entry to a team of World Health Organisation (WHO) experts who were due to arrive in the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus.The news comes amid growing suspicions of a cover-up in the country where Covid-19 is believed to have originated at the end of 2019, although its origins remain bitterly contested as China remains determined to control the narrative.The head of the World Health Organisation says he was \u0027disappointed\u0027 that Chinese officials have not finalised permissions for the arrival of the team of experts.A year after the outbreak started, WHO experts were due in China for a highly politicised visit to explore the origins of the coronavirus, in a trip trailed by accusations of cover-ups, conspiracy and fears of a whitewash.The WHO said China granted permission for a visit by its experts, with a 10-person team expected to arrive this week - but before most could even begin their journeys they faced roadblocks, with Beijing yet to grant them entry.The WHO\u0027s emergencies director Michael Ryan said Tuesday that the problem was a lack of visa clearances, adding that he hoped it was a \u0027logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly.\u0027World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, says members of the international scientific team have begun over the last 24 hours to leave from their home countries to China as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government.\u0027Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team\u0027s arrival in China,\u0027 he said at a news conference Tuesday in Geneva.\u0027I am very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute,\u0027 Tedros told reporters in Geneva, in a rare rebuke of Beijing from the UN body.He added that he has \u0027been in contact with senior Chinese officials\u0027 and that he had \u0027once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for the WHO.\u0027I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure of the earliest possible deployment. We\u0027re eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,\u0027 he said.Earlier this week Chinese authorities had refused to confirm the exact dates and details of the visit, a sign of the enduring sensitivity of their mission.Covid-19 was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, before seeping beyond China\u0027s borders to wreak global havoc, costing over 1.8 million lives and eviscerating economies.But its origins remain bitterly contested, lost in a fog of recriminations and conjecture from the international community - as well as obfuscation from Chinese authorities determined to keep control of its virus narrative."},{"url":null,"title":"Actress refuses appear Womans Hour accusing host Emma Barnett degrading ","story":"Share this article Today\u0027s programme about the \u0027Me Too\u0027 movement\u0027 took place one year on from the start of Harvey Weinstein\u0027s court case in America. Barnett was discussing, \u0027what the #MeToo movement has achieved and the unintended consequences.\u0027But the show also sparked anger among some listeners after one of the actresses claimed some women \u0027lied\u0027 about sexual abuse accusations. She told the show: \u0027There are the bad apples out there that jump on the band wagon and maybe aren\u0027t telling the truth..you hope there aren\u0027t too many liars out there.\u0027 Others took to social media to share frustration about comments made by guest Lionel Shriver on the show. The American author claimed MeToo, \u0027has made women more paranoid, more hostile,\u0027 and, \u0027diminished women in the eyes of men.\u0027        "},{"url":null,"title":"Adorable moment golden retriever got baffled pair slippers","story":"Share this article The video was a huge hit after it was shared on Molly\u0027s own Instagram page which boasts almost 43,000 followers.The video has racked up over 220,00 likes from fans who have fallen in the love with the curious pooch.One user commented: \u0027OMG amazing.

The new strain of the virus is not yet spreading as widely in the North of the country. NHS figures show that on the worst day in the first wave, April 12, there were 18,974 people with Covid-19 in England\u0027s hospitals.On December 29 this was 21,787. It has since spiralled to 26,626 but hospital-by-hospital data is not yet available for the extra 5,000 patients.December\u0027s data shows that London has the greatest number of Covid patients in hospital – in part because it has the biggest population – but there have been far sharper rises in the South East and the East of England.In the East of the country, inpatient numbers are 74 per cent higher than they were in the spring, with 2,922 patients on December 29 compared to 1,679 on April 12.There were 62 per cent more in the South East – 3,796 compared to 2,342.In London, the Midlands and the South West, there were between eight and nine per cent more patients at the end of December than at the country\u0027s peak in April.But the North East, North West and Yorkshire all now have fewer inpatients than they did nine months ago. Many hospitals in the North, however, experienced the same spiralling pressures now being seen in the South at the start of the first wave in September, October and November, when cases were still low in other parts of the country.Mid and South Essex NHS trust, which runs hospitals in Southend, Basildon and Chelmsford, is one of the ones to have seen the biggest spike in patients during the second wave. On December 29 it had 785 people on wards with Covid-19, which was 411 more than double the 374 on April 12, England\u0027s peak.East Kent Hospitals has seen admissions almost three times as high, with 415 patients compared to 143, while the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust had 3.5 times as many patients in December: 299 compared to 85. "},{"url":null,"title":"EU countries face delays

walk-in takeaway service during the new coronavirus lockdown in England.The fast food chain said its dine-in and walk-in takeaway offering would not be available while it reassessed its procedures with an independent health and safety body.However the firm, which has about 1,300 outlets in the UK, said its restaurants would remain open for its drive-through and delivery services.Paul Pomroy, McDonald’s UK and Ireland chief executive, said: “This is a temporary change in our operations to allow us to test and validate any additional measures that may further enhance the safety of our takeaway service.”McDonald’s said it would update customers with any changes to its service via its website and app.Under the January restrictions, which constitute England’s toughest lockdown since March, all non-essential retail and hospitality must close or remain closed.Restaurants, pubs and other hospitality venues are not allowed to offer dining on the premises, but can continue to offer deliveries or takeaways.However, they are no longer allowed to serve takeaway or click and collect alcohol, amid concerns about people congregating around pubs and bars.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also in lockdown.Fast food chains including McDonald’s, Burger King and Nando’s initially closed during the first nationwide lockdown last spring, before introducing new safety measures and working practices, which allowed them to gradually reopen restaurants for takeaway, delivery and drive-through services.A spokesman for Burger King said takeaway was still available in some branches but “restaurants operating drive-through, takeaway, click and collect and delivery via Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat, will continue to operate these services, in line with guidance issued”.Pret a Manger said it would keep some of its branches open for takeaway and delivery services, although some remain closed because of reduced footfall.A spokesperson for the coffee and sandwich chain said keeping 230 of its 389 UK branches open allowed it to “provide convenient access to freshly prepared food to communities and donate more meals to those who need it, with our charity partners”.The firm said it had reviewed its safety processes and believed it had “strong protocols in place to ensure our shops can safely remain open for both takeaway and delivery”.Pret shifted its business to focus on delivery in 2020 and said it had seen a significant increase in the use of delivery by customers since.Deliveroo said in response to the new restrictions it had launched mandatory contact-free delivery to customers, as well as mandatory contact-free pickup from restaurants.However, takeaway deliveries are permitted only until 11pm under the government restrictions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a555a2b94067f7392a7a888ac693e12ed3adbf/0_73_2200_1319/master/2200.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eab9ee060a87e1e0888d81b57220abe3","title":"uk watchdog investigating nvidia dollar 40bn takeover of arm","story":"Competition and Markets Authority examining deal to buy UK-based chip firmBritain’s competition watchdog has launched an investigation into the $40bn (£29.5bn) takeover of the UK-based chip designer Arm by the US company Nvidia.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has called for interested parties to submit views on the contentious deal before the launch of a formal investigation later this year.Arm Holdings, which employs 6,500 staff including 3,000 in the UK, is a global leader in designing chips for smartphones, computers and tablets. California-based Nvidia, a graphics chip specialist, announced its plan to buy the British tech group from Japan’s SoftBank in September.SoftBank had acquired Arm for $32bn in 2016, when the Japanese company took advantage of the fall in value of the pound after the Brexit vote. Arm is based in Cambridge but has operations in a number of UK towns and cities, including Manchester, Belfast and Warwick.Its chief executive, Simon Segars, acknowledged at the time of the Nvidia deal that it could take up to 18 months to win approval from regulators around the world.On Wednesday, the chief executive of the CMA, Andrea Coscelli, said: “The chip technology industry is worth billions and critical to many of the products that we use most in our everyday lives. We will work closely with other competition authorities around the world to carefully consider the impact of the deal and ensure that it doesn’t ultimately result in consumers facing more expensive or lower-quality products.”The CMA said it would examine the possible effect of the deal on competition in the UK and whether Arm had an “incentive to withdraw, raise prices or reduce the quality of its intellectual property licensing services to Nvidia’s rivals”.If the investigation finds that the deal breaches UK competition rules, the CMA’s powers include the authority to block the takeover.In October, Hermann Hauser, the co-founder of Arm, wrote to the House of Commons foreign affairs committee arguing that if the deal was allowed to proceed, the combined business would become the next US tech monopoly alongside companies such as Google and Facebook.He has argued that because Nvidia is one of more than 500 users of Arm’s designs worldwide – which include Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm – becoming the Cambridge-based business’s parent company will destroy Arm’s “even-handed” model and ultimately kill the world-leading British tech company.Hauser also told the BBC last year the deal would be “an absolute disaster for Cambridge, the UK and Europe”, adding that Nvidia would inevitably decide to relocate Arm to the US, leading to lost jobs.Hauser has said the government should use its powers to prevent the takeover, but has also backed indefinite legally binding conditions as an alternative. These include a guarantee to keep Arm’s staff in Cambridge, Belfast, Manchester and Warwick, and a promise that Nvidia does not get preferential treatment on new versions of the designer’s chips.The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, has also expressed concerns about the deal, and has called on the government to intervene to prevent parts of Arm from being moved out of the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26ccc5e44bf058553434147535772703bbff648/0_46_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=6a38d5c6ac0a23e5764aa0dc6669cc1c","title":"a level and gsce students how are you feeling about exams","story":"We would like to hear from students in England about their reaction to summer exams likely being cancelledThe education secretary is due to make a statement in the Commons on Wednesday saying summer exams in core subjects may still go ahead in England.

I can confirm that GCSEs, A-levels and AS level exams will not go ahead this summer,” he said.“This year, we’re going to put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms,” he said. He added that the Department for Education and Ofqual, the exams regulator, “had already worked up a range of contingency options”, which would be finalised soon, with help also from exam boards and teaching organisations.“I can confirm now that I want to use a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country,” he said.Williamson also said the government had “significantly stepped up” digital support where students kept out of school were unable to access online lessons, with a million laptops and tablets purchased and 750,000 to be distributed by the end of next week.“I never wanted to be in a position where we had to close schools again,” Williamson said. “The last thing any education secretary wants to do is announce that schools will close, and this is not a decision that the government ever wanted to take.“I’d like to reassure everyone that our schools have not suddenly become unsafe, but limiting the number of people who attend them is essential when the Covid rates are climbing as they are now.”Green was scathing in her response, telling Williamson: “It’s disappointing that he didn’t make a new year’s resolution to avoid U-turns or chronic incompetence.“Once again, where the secretary of state goes, chaos and confusion follows, and it’s children, families and education staff across the country who pay the price for his incompetence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1d77fe9d7879f5cf967ebfc218182e3d0e4d7ef/0_386_5816_3491/master/5816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2694de5d94636aeb28ae7be2f893d9d","title":"share your experiences of homeschooling during the new uk lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from parents and s about how they have been coping with teaching children at homeThe prime minister said he would be “extremely cautious” about when schools will be able to reopen fully after lockdown is lifted.

As head of recruitment within Red Bull’s operation, he watched players move from Salzburg to Leipzig as outsiders screamed in horror. There was grumbling, too, as Chelsea sent 28 loan players on loan to Vitesse Arnhem following Alexander Chigirinsky’s takeover of the Dutch club. The numbers have diminished vastly but Armando Broja, a 19-year-old striker, has been temporarily – and successfully – dispatched to Arnhem from Stamford Bridge.But what of a reverse scenario, whereby Chelsea cast admiring glances towards one of the talents in Vitesse’s squad? “I would definitely open the door for them to talk about it because we have that good relationship but the market determines a price,” Spors says. “They don’t give presents to us and we don’t give presents to someone else.”Recruitment, such a fundamental part of Spors’s role, is about to be affected by Brexit. The situation is particularly notable in the Netherlands, where non-EU players can be signed only when at a premium salary level, albeit reduced for under-20s. “A lot of people aren’t realising this all happens in January,” Spors says. “I’m still getting a lot of contact about taking young English players. I have to tell people that just isn’t possible. I think a lot of people will have a hard confrontation with the new rules, especially until things settle down. We can’t just take any English player we want.“ It can really be a game-changer. At the moment, a lot of young talent from Holland and Belgium leave for English academies at an early age. That won’t be possible any more, they’ll have to stay until at least 18 and even then they have to meet the points criteria. For us, other countries – Germany, France – should become stronger in this market as England can’t pick up this talent.”Spors’s own journey is fascinating. At 38, he is the youngest sporting director in the Ereisie and the only one without a professional playing background. Vitesse hired him on that precise basis. “They wanted someone who had worked themselves up to this position,” he says.This year came Spors’s first key decision to find a head coach. His fellow German Thomas Letsch – also formerly of the Red Bull network – was hired by early December, Vitesse sat second in the table and now they are behind third-placed Feyenoord on goal difference.“I made it clear, I am standing for a certain playing style,” says Spors. “It is intense. If you compare to the Premier League, more the Klopp direction than the Guardiola direction.”Spors was a student in Heidelberg when asked to produce video analysis for Hoffenheim. As the club grew under Ralf Rangnick – from Germany’s third tier to the Bundesliga – so, too, did Spors’s involvement. He spent five years as head of first-team match analysis before leading the scouting department. That role, he insists, shouldn’t be as difficult as many portray.“Most important is that the club has a clear strategy,” Spors says. “You have to make clear the way the club wants to play and the definition of the position needed. The scout can only deliver quality when this is clear by profiling. Very often that clear profile or the analytical work is the problem.”Spors is defensive, understandably, of the Red Bull method. Salzburg and Leipzig can no longer work in tandem because of Champions League involvement, which perhaps illustrates its success.“In terms of a development plan for a player, the environment is perfect,” he says. “They had important role models like Naby Keïta: Salzburg to Leipzig to the Premier League. It’s very important for the development of a young player to be at the right level at the right time. Red Bull could always offer this – perfect levels for young players.“From a business point of view, the model makes sense. When you want to be competitive at the highest level, you need a big platform. What made Red Bull strong all the time was smart recruitment of young players to develop. They created value.”Logic suggests Vitesse will finish this season behind the powerhouses. Yet the club’s trajectory is striking. “Qualifying for Europe would be a massive success because that isn’t easy in Holland,” Spors says. “We have to work harder, think smarter. We are spending less money than before but Europe is possible with this young, energetic team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dce577f1e8434ee1e444d0dda057b6ef94b522/0_87_4503_2702/master/4503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e629495c60596e45c163390224db69f","title":"colin bell a life in pictures","story":"The ‘King of the Kippax’ has died aged 74 after a short illness – we take a look back at the career of the legendary Manchester City midfielder"},{"url":null,"title":"orwells animal farm game review nerial dairymen","story":"PC, Mac, Android, iPhone NerialThe DairymenThe novella’s dated metaphors are ousted in the best moments of this interactive homage, but its alternative endings pull their punchesIn my version of Animal Farm, Boxer the workhorse doesn’t go to the knacker’s yard. He spends his retirement peacefully, following the abandonment of the windmill project. The ogreish boar Napoleon is unable to seize power after his canine enforcers run away for lack of food. Both he and his rival Snowball die of old age, leaving the farm in the hands of a relatively benign pig cabal backed up by an avian surveillance network. All the animals learn to read and write – the rats even start a newsletter – and the pigs never get chummy with their human neighbours. Six of seven laws of Animalism are kept unchanged: two legs are definitely not better than four, and no animal is more equal than the others.This is one of several endings to Orwell’s Animal Farm, an interactive homage to George Orwell’s allegorical tale of an animal uprising corrupted by porky autocrats. Lasting around three hours, it sees you re-enacting and, in some cases, reinventing key scenes from the well-loved book by sliding a magnifying glass over the farm, highlighting animals and putting their thoughts into action.As in the developer’s previous Tinder-meets-monarchy-simulator game Reigns, this branching narrative sits atop some rudimentary strategic challenges, such as making sure that everybody has enough food for the winter, building defences against invading human farmers, and trying not to overwork inidual characters. All of this is simply but lushly conveyed by storybook illustrations and a stirring orchestral score.It’s a sensitive adaptation – and a solid introduction to satire for book-phobic kids – but also a flawed one. Video games have a tendency to confuse mechanical busywork with sophistication, and the management elements feel rather aimless here – are Orwell’s ideas about how revolutions may undo themselves really furthered by having to count the bales in the hay barn, or tot up sheep morale?The game is also too faithful to Orwell’s plot, for all the alternative endings. At its best, it encourages you to rethink and even challenge some of the novella’s concepts, including its rather dated classist metaphors. What if the rats were more of an opposition than an infestation? What if the sheep were more than mindless propaganda machines? But these ergences are frustratingly limited by the need to pack in familiar scenes and conversations from the book. In the end, Orwell’s Animal Farm can’t work out whether it’s a retelling or a revolution – but with the nation’s schoolkids in lockdown, it’s nonetheless a valuable adaptation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/054ec8b64ae6e85b90e65cdda7f8cec74ae61ec0/143_0_3643_2185/master/3643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c22f8e01a743e1cba84223a2dc5fa15","title":"silence your inner critic a guide to self compassion in the toughest times","story":"Is your internal monologue friendly, calm and encouraging – or critical and bullying? Here is how to change it for the betterTobyn Bell still remembers the precise moment when his self-compassion practice paid off.He had just arrived home from work and was turning over in his mind the mistakes he had made that day, what he could or should have done – the kind of self-critical thoughts he had struggled with for years. Then, unexpectedly, another voice piped up in response, calm and steadying, addressing Bell by a fond nickname from his childhood.While training to be a mental health nurse, Bell had learned tactics to counter and give context to his inner critic. In that otherwise mundane moment, when his internal monologue leapt to meet cruelty with kindness, they were revealed to have been effective.“Because I’d really practised this self-compassionate voice, it just showed up and answered,” Bell says. “It felt really moving. I’d never thought that could be possible.”Many of us may see self-compassion as akin to mindfulness or gratitude: a worthy goal that is hard to turn into a habitual practice. But, as Bell’s example shows, it is possible to change our inner monologue, with benefits for not only our inidual health and happiness, but perhaps that of society.By fostering compassion for ourselves, experts say, we are more readily able to feel it for other people, meaning our kinder, calmer, more empathic approach can radiate outwards. With more months of lockdown looming, with all the uncertainty and unhappiness that is likely to bring, changing your inner monologue is one small – and, crucially, free – step towards looking after your mental health.Self-compassion is not self-care, in the superficial chocolates-and-bubble-bath sense – nor is it simply being kind. Paul Gilbert, a clinical psychologist and the founder of the Compassionate Mind Foundation, says compassion is best understood as turning towards suffering, whether it is in yourself or others, and taking action to alleviate it.Instead of finding fleeting ways to feel better, self-compassion is a readiness to engage with pain at its source. The aim is to be able to treat yourself as a doctor would, Gilbert suggests: not only taking your suffering seriously, but helping to relieve it. “It’s this ability, when we are suffering, to stand back and say: ‘What is this about, why do I feel this? And what would be the most helpful thing for me now?’”Negative self-talk is not evidence of something “wrong” with us that needs to be fixed it is a feature of being human. Our propensity to cause ourselves anguish is an evolved function of what Gilbert terms our “tricky” brain. Our complex cognitive system – able to imagine, anticipate and conceive of an objective “self” – is equally inclined to dwell on negative thoughts such as “If only I’d …” and “I should have …” This triggers the same fight-or-flight, physiological response as an external threat.“Self-compassion is always a trade-off with self-criticism,” says Gilbert. For some people, the balance is so skewed that their inner critic governs who – and how – they are in the world. Not only is this a miserable existence, but it often underpins problematic relationships with drugs, alcohol, food or work, in the attempt to find some relief, as well as mental health problems including depression.Many of us have become adept at avoiding uncomfortable or unpleasant emotions – whether it is because we are distracted by our busy lives, or simply unable to cope with what we might find. The first step towards self-compassion is gaining awareness of our inner world: what triggers feelings of anger, disgust or shame how we instinctively react to them the content (and tone) of our internal monologue and any blocks or resistances we encounter.Deborah Lee, a consultant clinical psychologist and the head of trauma services at Berkshire Healthcare, describes it as creating a new “knowledge landscape” against which the pain can be recast. “In order for you to even see that you’ve got a self-critic, you’ve got to become a wise observer.”This process may be confronting – especially, says Lee, for people with trauma, who may have absorbed their abuser’s words into their internal monologue. “Developing self-compassion is developing insight so that you can see yourself, rather than be yourself, as such. It’s an ability to feel safe as opposed to traumatised – to develop the flexibility in your mind to develop a compassionate lens.”In his practice, Gilbert shows patients how to ground themselves during their “guided discovery” with breath, muscle relaxation or mindfulness exercises. (The Calm and Headspace apps have guided meditations for compassion there are also pdf and audio resources on the Compassionate Mind Foundation’s website.)Gilbert recommends soothing rhythm breathing, which is shown to alleviate stress and anxiety through its effect on the autonomic nervous system. With your shoulders, back and chest open, slow and deepen the breath to about five breaths a minute. The key is to maintain the smoothness of breath: five (or four, or six – just be consistent) seconds in, the same again out.Bell, now a psychotherapist working within the NHS in Manchester, says it is helpful to understand self-criticism as a dialogue between two aspects of the self. “There’s one part of you that’s really attacking, angry and hostile, and there’s another part of you that’s receiving it and feeling upset and hurt.”By seeing it as a relationship, you can step out of it and “relate to the conflict in a different way,” he says. In therapy, clients might differentiate between these aspects of the self by sitting in different chairs to give voice to them, or by personifying them with form or features.Bell suggests imagining your inner dialogue as that of two strangers on the street, and describing their relationship: “Often people say: ‘Well, it’s abusive,’” he says. “As soon as you can see it as external from you, you can see it more clearly.” It may even shed light on your inner critic’s origins by bringing to mind your dynamic with a parent, teacher or peer.Nina Savelle-Rocklin, a Los Angeles-based psychoanalyst and the author of The Binge Cure: 7 Steps to Outsmart Emotional Eating, says many of us learned to deny or smother our pain in childhood, leaving us with no idea of how to soothe ourselves in later life.She devised the “Vary” acronym to inform her clients’ responses: “Validate, acknowledge, reassure yourself.” The first step is especially important, Savelle-Rocklin says. “We tell ourselves when we are in emotional pain or distress: ‘It’s not that bad,’ ‘It’s going to be OK,’ ‘Look on the bright side’ … but we need to recognise within ourselves when we’re hurting.”Savelle-Rocklin says: “If you wouldn’t say it to a friend, don’t say it to yourself.” Not using the attacking second-person voice – or judgmental words such as “normal”, “ridiculous” and “should” – in dialogue with yourself can also help.It is not just what your inner monologue says – how it says it matters, too. Savelle-Rocklin recalls a client attempting to comfort herself in a defeated tone: “‘It’s going to be OK, it’s not that bad’ – she sounded as if she was reciting statistics.”Speaking to yourself with warmth and kindness can “feel like a verbal hug” by triggering the physiological memory of feeling safe, says Savelle-Rocklin. Maintaining an open, upright posture and friendly facial expression can similarly influence your mind, even if it doesn’t reflect how you feel, says Gilbert.It is unrealistic to expect to silence your inner critic – but you can, as Bell did, train up another voice to counter it. Building a new monologue is “more positive and hopeful than thinking: ‘I’ve got to battle the critic’”, he says. He suggests starting by imagining a friend or family member who cares about you answering on your behalf.Negative self-talk can also be reframed as a well-meaning coach or protector, or simply an indicator of mental state. Bell has come to see his critical voice as a “red flag” that he is feeling vulnerable and in need of some care. “The function of it has changed … You can then use it to your benefit.”Compassion has as much to do with our relationships to other people as with ourselves, says Gilbert. Fostering connection and ways we can care for others reorganises our tricky brains to draw meaning from these relationships, instead of the self. When we feel supported by others, and safe, we feel better able to extend that to others.The aim is to create a “compassionate mindset” where we not only feel compassion for ourselves and others, but are open to receiving it too, says Gilbert. “Self-compassion is really recognising what it is to be human: what our basic needs are, which is a sense of connectedness, and what moves us away from that.”The difficulty in fostering self-compassion is that much of modern life is geared towards competition – from our economic system, modelled around the assumption of scarcity, to our entertainment, where reality television contestants fight to avoid elimination.All of this triggers our threat system, bringing out the worst in our primitive brains. A tenet of “compassion-focused therapy”, which Gilbert developed, is recognising that self-criticism is an entirely reasonable response to “swimming in a river that we shouldn’t be swimming in”, he says.“What tends to lie under self-criticism is this fear of not being good enough, being dismissed or devalued, seen as undesirable – but we live in a society that is constantly, from the day we are born, judging, evaluating, rating and ranking us … Nobody teaches us how to deal with suffering,” he says.Lee says learning to be compassionate takes daily discipline, just like physical fitness. “If you want to feel the benefits … you have to put the work in.” But, she adds, the hardest part is granting yourself the permission to do it and accepting that you deserve to be at peace with yourself.Making that commitment marks the start of a “lifelong journey”, says Lee. She tells her patients that the longest relationship they will ever have is with themselves – “so would you like to take your self-critic with you, or your compassionate friend?”• In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

When police happened upon the scene, the man at the wheel was asleep. To hear him slur his words as officers asked where he was going and where he had been, he might well have been somewhere on the fifth planet from the sun and not in the bedroom community that is Jupiter, Florida. And when he added that, no, he had not been drinking, an officer couldn’t help but wonder, “Are you sure?”Things only got worse once the man – zonked out on prescription drugs, as it happened – staggered his 6ft frame out of the car and on to the cool blacktop, a rippling vision of Florida Man chic in long sleeves, shorts and bare feet. He couldn’t keep his hand down tracking a light beam, couldn’t heel-toe a straight line, couldn’t recite the alphabet because he thought he was being asked “to sing the national anthem backwards.” When the officer asked if he had anything prickly on his person, the man, after an initial denial, confessed to “a few screws in the body” – mementoes from surgeries on his left knee and back. The entire incident goes down in about 20 minutes, maybe less. And as police cam B-roll goes, bless, it’s fairly G-rated. It’s only after the mind races to connect it to the more grisly police videos that have filled our timelines over the past six or so years, and this summer in particular, does this clip from Jupiter leave you breathless. That’s when you realize that, really, could have been the last we ever saw of Tiger Woods.The dashcam footage of Woods’s 2017 DUI stop is just one of the many pivotal moments recalled in Tiger, a two-part documentary on the superstar golfer that debuts on HBO this Sunday in the US, with part two airing the following week. It is a quintessential HBO Sports documentary, which is to say it takes a thorough and fair look at the rise, fall and recovery of one of history’s most sphinxlike figures. You won’t be surprised to learn that Woods politely declined an invitation to participate in this project but, rest assured, his face and voice are well represented in a breadth of archival interviews that date all the way back to his appearance on the Mike Douglas Show at the age of two opposite Jimmy Stewart and Bob Hope.Given how insanely long the 45-year-old Woods has been a certifiably famous person, you may wonder what more there is to learn about a man whose life would become a marker of time in our own. (Where were you when he crushed at Augusta in ’97? Or when he hit that fire hydrant on Thanksgiving in 2009?) But there’s plenty of protein here for viewers who don’t mind reckoning with our shared obsession with “godding up” sports heroes and celebs just to watch them tumble. “The interesting thing to me is how quickly and how much glee the media – and, in some quarters, the public – took in his downfall,” says Matthew Hamachek, who is the co-director of Tiger alongside Matt Heineman. “That was very telling.”In Woods’s case, though, the lofty expectations started with his late father, Earl – who famously told Sports Illustrated’s Gary Smith that his son was “The Chosen One”. Earl’s presence looms large in the first-half of the documentary, and there’s no missing the bond between father and son in the pride and power with which the boy repeatedly refers to himself as black. It isn’t until the Nike money starts rushing in and Earl’s philandering become a threat to his son’s saintly brand image (oh, the irony) that you hear Tiger referring to his race as “Cablinasian”. Never mind if that wasn’t the word Jupiter police used in their report.Woods’s DUI charge, which was lawyered down to a reckless driving plea, lingers in the doc like a baddie in a slasher flick. But safe shelter is easy enough to find among a slew of supporting characters in Tiger, who range from close family friend Pete McDaniel to longtime bagman Steve Williams – none of whom, alas, are close to Woods now. And yet: “The thing that was most surprising to me in the process is that people who even had acrimonious splits from Tiger are all fiercely protective of him,” Hamachek says. “These are people who really had a front-row seat to the pressures and expectations thrust upon him and felt like part of their job was to protect him from the world. Earning these people’s trust was extremely difficult.”Dina Parr, the golfer’s high school sweetheart, experienced one of the harsher Woods breakups, via letter. And yet her home videos of a teenage Woods cutting loose offer a glimpse into the sweet soul underneath the driver-clobbering automaton in that blood-red Sunday polo.But she is unlikely to be the woman in Woods’s life in which viewers of this documentary are most interested. Nor for that matter is Elin, his ex-wife and mother to his two children. No, that honor goes to Rachel Uchitel, the first of several women to be outed as a Woods mistress and easily the biggest get for the makers of the documentary. And to watch the show reflect on the fevered tabloid media effort to out her and Woods’s other paramours in 2009, with the daily revelations of lose-my-number voicemails and the golfer’s marathon sex drive, is to be reminded of a simpler time when the National Enquirer – not TMZ – was the sleaziest gossip rag and Taiwanese news animation was totally a thing.Woods’s sex-addicted downward spiral fuel the doc’s second half, and it leaves you wondering whether Elin might have forgiven her husband’s transgressions if they had been flings and not fully blown emotional relationships, and whether Woods has even one black women in his life. They don’t surface in his romantic life, and they don’t surface in this documentary either. “I don’t think it’s happenstance,” says executive producer Sam Pollard. “Growing up in America as a person of color, when you’re engaged in the white world, sometimes you don’t connect with your own people like people assume that you would.” Not even Royce, the older half-sister from Earl’s first marriage who fed Woods and did his laundry while he was breaking NCAA records at Stanford, makes an appearance. Think of this as the white space in an otherwise textured portrait of a complicated man.At the very least, Tiger should leave you feeling sympathetic for the man – who, despite his incredible athletic gifts and huge fame, never looked like he chose to be The Chosen One. It could well have you going back to read the statement he released after the police killing of George Floyd and how far out of the way it went to empathize with law enforcement who “train so diligently to understand how, when and where to use force.” Those words, typical Woods, seemed so cautious and even cowardly then – especially when compared to the more assertive tone struck by Michael Jordan, the greatest political fence sitter of all time until last summer. But after watching the doc you appreciate the statement for what it is – the words of a man who is just trying to survive another day in America. Sounds mighty black to me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e18bec9e9dce03d57213db20fd08311cafe8b3b/0_278_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f32e0eced16f807bbd969961d9d784cb\" height=\"2419\" width=\"4032\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"css-uk6cul\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"css-xe26t6\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"css-1vo1rhq\"\u003e\u003csvg width=\"11\" height=\"10\" viewBox=\"0 0 11 10\"\u003e\u003cpath fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M5.5 0L11 10H0z","title":"cake decorating quizzes and remote lunches keeping staff connected in the remote work era","story":"We can’t meet for a chat by the coffee machine right now, so how are firms keeping spirits high? With creative and fun virtual activities, it seemsNurturing a sense of shared purpose with work colleagues is challenging in these days of remote work and video meetings. Gone are post-work pints, sandwich-queue chats, tasting your colleague’s “cake-off” creation, and anything else resembling physical proximity and connection to your team. But with a little ingenuity – and a tolerance for 2D socialising – it’s still possible to keep spirits high and have fun.From virtual magicians and online games to judging cakes purely on how delicious they look on Zoom, employees are finding new ways to bond with colleagues – remotely. Events such as quizzes and lunchtime yoga may even have become more popular now that people can log on from home rather than having to stay late at the office or endure a lunch-hour sweat.Jade Emmons, a London-based communications manager for Degreed, a US education technology company, spent part of Halloween in fancy dress, running around her home seeking random items of clothing and a pumpkin as part of a competitive scavenger hunt. That was one of several online games held during her company’s virtual party.Other companies have been equally imaginative. One media organisation replaced its summer party with a global rendition of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which correspondents from around the world took on some of Shakespeare’s most popular roles.Meanwhile, at Kindred, a PR firm, winning the 2020 baking competition hinges on how well you can pipe icing rather than perfect the best rise, as in previous years. Each participant received a Betty Crocker cake mix, so the real challenge was the decoration. A Chris Whitty cake – very 2020 – dreamed up by associate director Beccie Stevenson, made it to the final round. “You can’t taste it so it’s all down to the aesthetic,” she says.Stevenson is also a fan of a monthly initiative called Change Maker that gets people to nominate a colleague of the month. Her last pick was Emma Parrish, who won in October for the effort she put into suggesting books, podcasts and music to celebrate Black History Month. “She tackled quite difficult conversations, head on,” says Stevenson. Each winner gets to virtually spin a wheel to win a prize, which ranges from an alarm clock to a pair of sheepskin slippers.Nick Winham, whose job is overseeing a programme to recruit and train the next generation of talent for the software provider ServiceNow, is one of the California-based company’s culture champions, helping to run initiatives to keep its dispersed workforce feeling connected. He says the shift to remote working has resulted in many more people taking part in events such as quizzes. “When we did them at the office, we’d only get 15 people at most,” he says. “Doing them virtually, we’re getting 40 to 50. Other colleagues join in with their families.” Virtual yoga and meditation sessions are also proving to be much more popular than the real-life versions ever were.For companies keen to introduce their own programmes, Winham’s tips include blocking off time during the working day for non-work sessions. His quizzes, for instance, are at 4pm on Thursdays, with a takeaway pizza prize for the winner. “It gets very competitive,” he says.A “step-up” challenge earlier this summer, where ServiceNow colleagues formed teams to record their daily step counts, proved popular thanks to a novel twist that saw two executive directors volunteer to do something different with their hair depending on how much money was raised during the week-long challenge. “That created engagement,” Winham says. “Step-up September” developed as a result, with teams from across Europe.Other activities encourage people to chat openly about the challenges of working from home, with some offering coping tips. “The main advice has been to take a break,” Winham says, adding that he went for a walk before talking to me.London-based LocalGlobe, which invests in startup tech companies, hosts virtual “lunch and learn sessions” with guests as erse as the founder of the small business supporter Funding Circle and a representative of the anti-poverty group Camden Giving. Emma Phillips, a partner at LocalGlobe, says she wants to do all she can to keep employees engaged and connected. “At the moment people are feeling more cut off and isolated than ever, and there is concern that once we’ve defeated Covid-19, we’ll have an even worse mental health pandemic on our hands.”Often the simplest ideas can help compensate for the lack of in-person interaction. Online channels dedicated to different interests, from cats to physical fitness, work well at Degreed, says Emmons, although she steers clear of the HIIT workout and body-building chat. “Our London office manager has a virtual running club that she’s tried to convince me to join, but I’ve managed to dodge it so far!”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances.

I was ill and mostly confined to the sofa, trying to keep down mince pies as my big sister made her way through the VHS release of Andrew Davies’ Pride and Prejudice.

Unapologetically daft, it luxuriates in playing with the form and conventions of costume dramas, instilling them with modern storytelling chops and the sort of overblown production I last saw in Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette. It sees the Regency period through American eyes, highlighting the things that people like most about British aristocratic tropes: the grandeur, the pomp and the gilded cages. The repressed sexuality is still on show, but it is countered by unapologetically rampant bonking and homoerotic boxing.But the show is about far more than sex and siring heirs. Bridgerton even managed to make me interested in the logistical problems of 19th-century aristocrats. How do you cope when you have wasted your daughters’ dowry on ill-advised wagers? Why do the townsfolk recoil in horror when m’lady refuses to choose a pig for the slaughter? What about hiding the tell-tale bump of a forthcoming illegitimate child when you have a ball to attend? One of the best scenes is when Daphne confronts her mother after she doesn’t tell her about the intricacies of the birds and the bees. Yes, that sounds utterly ridiculous when written down, but the Shondaland framing manages to make it compelling.I don’t think I will be reaching for the Pride and Prejudice VHS any time soon, but Bridgerton has made me – and probably thousands of others – reconsider what a costume drama can be.Bridgerton is a romp – in all senses of the word. Take the very first scene, where the debutante Daphne waits to be escorted to London by her brother, while we see him pants-at-knees humping an opera singer against a tree. It is an impressive amount of bottom in the first three minutes – you didn’t get this in Cranford, but then nor did you get an orchestral reimagining of Ariana Grande as a soundtrack.And so begins this very modern period drama a romantic rollick set in 1813 London that feels eerily prescient to contemporary pandemic Britain. It is courting season on Grosvenor Square, where “titled, chaste and innocent” girls flounce into the capital to find – or be thrust upon, or laden down with – a respectable male suitor. Potential matches meet with chaperones, often in public spaces, and touching is strictly forbidden. It is not exactly the same as illicitly meeting up with a Hinge or Tinder match and pretending to do “exercise” around the local park, but nor does it feel so very far removed. It made me wonder whether, in 2227, viewers will watch London’s singletons, in knockoff Moncler duvet coats with woolly hats and Thermoses, endure socially distanced park-bench dates while hoping for a sneaky touch on the arm, in a period drama about the great pandemic courting season of 202021.Shonda Rhimes, the Bridgerton producer, has quenched a thirst in bleak times, not just for a bit of fluff, pomp and drama to soothe tired new year minds, but for the recognition that chastity is very hard, strict social rules make people miserable and that some people will inevitably break them – especially the moneyed and powerful. She has also managed to balance the audience’s gaze on the male and female body equally. It is rare to find on-screen depictions of sex where the men are as unclothed as the women. Here, there are more male tops off than the 1994 Take That European tour it takes a bit of time to adjust to seeing the Viscount Bridgerton fully dressed.And so as lockdown continues and the absence of touch is felt even more cruelly, Bridgerton – with its circus of secret trysts, gossip and drama – is a perfect balm for those at home, alone, with a long winter ahead.I have a rule about TV. If there are no people of colour in a show, I try not to watch. However, this rule, despite its many benefits – I watch less TV than I otherwise would and have an excuse for refusing to watch many of Judd Apatow’s films – has confused me into thinking I didn’t like period dramas.I now realise this is untrue. Bridgerton has taught me that I do like period dramas – I was just put off by the near-total whiteness. Period dramas are supposed to speak to all women – thanks to the supposedly universal themes of women being treated like a doormats. But as the  TV critic Ellen E Jones wrote, while talking about Fleabag: “Art that’s most often ascribed this kind of universality actually comes from the specific perspective of the dominant class. ‘Posh girls’, for short.” To this I would add only that this almost always means “posh white girls”, so you’ll understand why I didn’t vibe with period dramas before now.But who can resist the themes of scandal, betrayal and stupid men? In Bridgerton, these three things are cleverly combined with an element of mystery: a gossip columnist called Lady Whistledown informs high-society London (AKA “the ton”) of all three, by mail every week – and of course everyone, the viewers included, want to know who she is.Brown people have been around in England for a while (Cheddar man, anyone?). Yet TV and film have long been happy to whitewash not just history, but also fiction – see the endless debates about whether fictional characters can be played by a person of colour (eg James Bond) and the lack of shame around casting white actors as brown people (see Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings).To say Bridgerton is the height of representation would be silly – the characters of colour are not treated well and have little agency. The Duke of Hastings is tricked by his wife, first into marrying her, then into having unprotected sex with her – which some critics have called sexual assault (a more clearcut theme in the book than the TV version). He does not want children (telling her, before they are married, that he “cannot” have them), but she then wields the power of the dictionary to fight this, insisting she had misconstrued his words and thought he was impotent. “Cannot is different to will not!” she proclaims.Marina Thompson, meanwhile, the beautiful black woman sent to live with the unremarkable Featheringtons, is subject to scorn, jealousy and ultimately revenge for being desirable. Queen Charlotte, played by an actor of colour in a nod to the conjecture that she may have been mixed race, pines for her mentally ill husband. (Others have pointed out that all the characters of colour who are love interests are light-skinned.) The only black character you don’t feel pity for is Lady Danbury, who, quite simply, is the role model you wish you had.The show suggests that the king marrying a black woman removed racial inequalities in the 19th-century – which, well, you only have to look at what happened to Meghan and Harry in the 21st century to know that utopia hasn’t arrived. Race is rarely mentioned. Then again, justifying brown characters in a show by adding a bit about “people-of-colour issues” is not exactly revolutionary.Bridgerton is watchable if ultimately predictable. If it were another show, I wouldn’t write about it. But to see people like me allowed to star in a genre that is usually cordoned off tricked me into exploring a world I never get to see on screen. I am not landed gentry or nobility, but I am a person of colour, and I have never, until this year, seen myself in a period drama (hats off to The Great, also). Perhaps the novelty will wear off, but to find novelty on TV in your 30s is an unadulterated joy.I loved Bridgerton. I loved all of its mindless Regency spectacle. At a time when politicians are arguing whether The Crown should come with a warning that it is not unfailingly factually accurate, Bridgerton unbridled itself from history – and made that debate seem stuffy and pointless. It took the Downton approach a step further, revelling in its anachronistic Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift string covers, Julie Andrews’ tattle-talking narrator and its erse cast.Like Gossip Girl – a 00s series getting the remake treatment – it is the kind of show you can consume while doing 100 other things or invest in fully to the detriment of your dinner (who cares about burnt fish fingers when you are pondering huge questions such as: “But will they? Or will they? And is she pregnant?!”).Executive produced by Shonda “Scandal” Rhimes, the puffy-sleeved hit has received the same criticism as some of her previous series, specifically that its “colour-blind” casting doesn’t hit the mark on race. In truth, it doesn’t – but neither does most TV in 2020. That said, Bridgerton does feel two-dimensional when it comes to race, more concerned with visibility than reality. Indeed, the whole period drama industrial complex has much to do when it comes to moving white narratives from the spotlight it is unfair to level all the criticism at one production and one creative of colour. Similarly, its portrayal of sex is rather “yikes” in places, but isn’t that more of a flaw of hundreds – or thousands – of years of patriarchal nonsense?Period dramas are very much not my thing. I enjoyed the memes of Saoirse Ronan shouting “I can’t!” more than I enjoyed Greta Gerwig’s long-winded adaptation of Little Women. I have read one Jane Austen novel (and I can’t even remember which one). Even the words “Downton Abbey” are enough to elicit a cold sweat – and that is before considering how preposterous Julian Fellowes’ writing is. Maybe it is the lack of iPhones, maybe it is the fact that the word “corset” makes my chest hurt, but something about them makes me nauseous.All that said, Bridgerton is an undoubted success. It has heart. It has goodies and baddies getting their dues. It has Nicola Coughlan from Derry Girls. And, for once, it has made me excited to watch a show set before 2000, which really is a revision of history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14c9de6fd8f6cb4fb5a0c0623c1370ab9622b00f/3_0_4557_2737/master/4557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e915576c60ff65ec0fedd21b869e8ab1","title":"georgia senate runoff elections live results","story":"Democrat Raphael Warnock secures historic victory as outstanding Senate race draws to a closeVoters in the state of Georgia returned to the polls on Tuesday to cast their ballots in two runoff elections that will determine control of the US Senate.

If the Democrats win both races, the president-elect will gain a big opportunity to build a progressive legacy.

What is the scientific justification for this decision?Why has the UK decided to lengthen the gap between the first and second doses of vaccine?The original plan was to offer priority groups an initial shot of vaccine, followed by a second dose three weeks later. But a rapid increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, combined with the emergence of a more transmissible variant and uncertainty about the supply of vaccine stocks, prompted the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider other options.It calculated that it could get a first shot of vaccine into more arms faster if it pushed back administration of the second dose to 12 weeks afterwards – by which time it is hoped that far more doses of vaccine will become available. “This is highly likely to have a greater public health impact in the short term and reduce the number of preventable deaths from Covid-19,” a JCVI statement said.Isn’t this the same strategy proposed by Tony Blair?The former prime minister proposed giving as many people as possible a single dose of a Covid vaccine rather than preserving stocks to enable a second jab, which is slightly different to what is now taking place.The JCVI has stressed that everyone will receive a second jab, it will just come later than originally planned, with a maximum interval of 12 weeks between first and second doses. This second “booster” dose is likely to strengthen and optimise the duration of the immune response, resulting in longer-term protection.Why are some scientists concerned about it?Chiefly because the impact of stretching out the two doses hasn’t been tested in clinical trials. Neither has giving a first dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, followed by a second dose of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, or vice versa – which the JCVI advises only in “exceptional circumstances”, eg if a second dose of the original vaccine isn’t available.The main risk is that people’s level of immunity falls before they receive their second dose, putting them at risk of Covid-19 – although this risk would still be lower than if they’d received no vaccine, and would be boosted when they eventually received their second shot. Pfizer cautioned that its trial only investigated giving two doses 21 days apart – far less than 12 weeks.However, a consensus statement by the British Society for Immunologists said that delaying the booster dose by eight or nine weeks was unlikely make much difference in thee longer-term.What about mixing and matching doses from different manufacturers?This also hasn’t been tested in clinical trials – although UK and Russian scientists are investigating whether combining shots of the OxfordAstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccines could result in better protection than two doses of the same one.Theoretically, combining doses from different manufacturers should still trigger an effective immune response, since almost all of the Covid-19 vaccines being developed are based on the same viral ‘“spike” protein, even if this is presented to our bodies in slightly different ways.Could other countries follow the UK?Possibly. The World Health Organization said there was no scientific evidence for a delay of more than six weeks in administering the second PfizerBioNTech vaccine dose, but Canada and Germany are believed to be considering this, and Denmark said it would permit a six-week gap to allow more people to receive a first shot. US health officials have ruled out this possibility, however."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de1e24d2eb04040e8b65fec7398ec66829263e6b/1378_996_5835_3501/master/5835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01e5ecacad0e0083b08f008df415034e","title":"england prepares for a wintry third lockdown in pictures","story":"Empty streets and shuttered shops as England grits its teeth for a new lockdown, with people allowed to leave their homes for limited reasons only, and measures expected to stay until mid-February or even March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a45291b4bd69740dd6ac8a6934234e70c5b49a3/0_305_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=486e305a612aa17fd83c81204a7d3848","title":"coronavirus live news who chief very disappointed after china blocks wuhan visit 1 in 50 infected in uk","story":"Ireland registers 7,836 new cases as it shuts down schools and construction work Moderna is second vaccine to get EU approvalUK health officials have decided to delay giving second doses of Covid-19 vaccines and even permit combining doses from different manufacturers, prompting international concern. What is the scientific justification for this decision?Mexico’s president said he was ready to provide coronavirus vaccines to undocumented migrants in the United States, after the governor of the US state of Nebraska said they would likely not get vaccinated due to immigration status.“It’s a universal right. We would do it,” president Andrés Manuel López Obrador said when asked if Mexico would vaccinate undocumented migrants in the US, many of which are Mexican nationals.He did not elaborate on how his government would execute such a plan, or which migrants would qualify.The comments on Tuesday about workers at Nebraska’s meat-packing plants by state governor Pete Ricketts, a member of president Donald Trump’s Republican party, had provoked criticism from public health and migrant advocates.“You’re supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine with that programme,” Ricketts told a coronavirus briefing.Widespread Covid-19 outbreaks occurred at meat-packing plants in the US in the spring, spreading the virus around rural America where plants are concentrated.Roberto Velasco, a senior Mexican diplomat for North America, responded to Ricketts on Tuesday night.“To deprive undocumented essential workers of Covid-19 vaccination goes against basic human rights,” he wrote on Twitter.Among critics of Ricketts’ statement was US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leader of pro-migrant progressives in the Democratic party of president-elect Joe Biden.“Imagine being so racist that you go out of your way to ensure that the people who prepare *your* food are unvaccinated,” she wrote on Twitter.The question of access to vaccines based on citizenship has become contentious in some parts of the world. For instance, rights groups have expressed outrage that Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip face a long wait for vaccines. Ireland has reported a record 7,836 Covid-19 cases, up from Monday’s previous high of 6,110, as the country’s chief medical officer said a highly transmissible strain first recorded in Britain had become more widespread.“There is evidence of an increasing presence of the UK variant in Ireland,” Tony Holohan said in a statement that warned of a “concerning escalation” of admissions to hospital and intensive care units.Ireland’s 14-day infection rate has almost quadrupled in 10 days from 210 cases per 100,000 on 27 December to 819 on Wednesday, according to health ministry data. France has reported 25,379 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, up from 20,489 on Tuesday but down from 26,457 last Wednesday, while the seven-day moving average also fell slightly.The health ministry also reported 283 new virus deaths in hospitals, from 345 on Tuesday, while the number of people in hospital with the disease fell again.Ireland is tightening its lockdown as hospitals treat a record number of patients with Covid-19, with many suffering the variant first detected in England.From Friday non-essential construction is to stop, from Saturday passengers arriving from Britain and South Africa must have a negative PCR test for Covid-19 and schools are to remain shut at least until the end of January.There is exception for leaving cert students – the equivalent of A-levels – who can attend school three days per week.“We may now be entering the most challenging phase of all,” the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, told a news conference on Wednesday. “Unless you are involved in absolutely essential work you have no reason to be away from your home.”A 5km travel limit for exercise announced last week remains in place – the government had considered reducing it to to 2km.Asked if pubs could still serve takeaway pints, Martin replied: “Forget about takeaway pints.” That led to congregation, he said.Hospitals are treating 921 people with the virus, exceeding the previous peak of 881 on 15 April.Authorities reported one bright spot: the number of close contacts for each infected person has fallen from 6 to 3.8.China has attempted to downplay concerns over its refusal to authorise a fact-finding mission to the country by the World Health Organization to study the origins of Covid-19, saying it is still negotiating access with the UN body.A day after the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “very disappointed” that China had not authorised the entry of the 10-strong research team, led by Dr Peter Ben Embarek, China insisted there had been a “misunderstanding” between the two sides about agreed dates for the visit, adding that discussions were ongoing.Tedros said on Tuesday that members of the international scientific team had begun departing their home countries over the previous 24 hours as part of an arrangement between WHO and China, but that he had discovered Chinese officials had still not finalised the necessary permissions.“I’m very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute, but had been in contact with senior Chinese officials,” he told a news conference in Geneva.China’s apparent obstruction of the mission, which the WHO describes as a priority, comes amid the country’s attempts to reshape the narrative of where the disease originated, despite a global scientific consensus that Covid-19 first jumped from animals into humans in China.The dire state of UK manufacturing has left us dependent on other nations. We may soon find out why some call this a ‘national security risk’, writes  columnist and senior economics commentator Aditya Chakrabortty.In many respects, the UK goes into this mass inoculation as well-prepared as possible. Standing ready to deliver the doses are not only NHS staff but, remarkably, a volunteer army of retired medics. The regulator moved speedily to approve both the PfizerBioNTech and the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccines. And Britain is blessed with world-class scientists, which is why we have a homegrown shot.But if the UK’s future depends on a vaccine, where are its vaccine factories? It is a fundamental question, yet one that only scientists appear to be asking. And their answer is utterly damning.Listen to John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford and key figure in its partnership with AstraZeneca to develop a British vaccine. This weekend he told the Times: “The government has been completely disinterested in building onshore capacity for any of the life-sciences products … And it turns out that manufacturing is a strategic asset for health security when stuff gets tough.” Like now.The UK lurched into this pandemic with only one injectable-vaccine factory of any size, a situation described by the head of the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, Peter Piot, as “a national security risk”.A more contagious variant of Covid-19 that swept through the UK has been reported in at least five states in the US, National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins told the Washington Post. “We have now seen that same UK virus in the US in at least five states and I would be surprised if that doesn’t grow pretty rapidly,” Collins said, adding that the strain doesn’t seem to be more severe.Last week, Reuters reported that Florida became the third known US state to identify such a case, with two other cases identified in Colorado and California.Scientists have said newly developed vaccines should be equally effective against both variants.The NIH director said he expects immunisations to be done through pharmacies soon as the country grapples with a surge in cases, with the number of vaccinations falling far short of early targets.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had administered more than 4.8m first doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country as of Tuesday morning and distributed more than 17m doses. Some Czech crematoriums are near or at capacity due to a rise in coronavirus deaths, and they are looking for alternative cremation sites, interior minister Jan Hamáček has said.The Czech Republic, one of the world’s hardest-hit countries with 12,436 coronavirus deaths, has been struggling with another surge of the illness, with new records in daily cases and rising hospital admissions pointing to more victims in coming weeks.The country’s 12.7 deaths per million using the latest seven-day average was the world’s highest rate, according to the Our World In Data website supported by Oxford University.Hamáček said the situation was hardest in the eastern region of Moravia-Silesia, while in other regions facilities were almost operating at full capacity. The deceased would have to be moved between regions, he said.“Right now, one such transport of around 50 bodies needs to be done, and we will act similarly in other cases,” he said at a press conference. “We will have to find a complex solution for the whole country.”The government relaxed restrictive measures ahead of Christmas before tightening them again amid public discontent, despite signs of resurgent infections.It raised restrictions to the highest level again from 27 December, closing most shops, imposing a 9pm curfew and barring public assembly of more than two people.In the past week, 127 people with Covid-19 died each day on average in the country of 10.7 million people, and those numbers are likely to be revised up.In a regular year, around 300 people die each day from all causes, but that number rose to as many as 600 in the worst two weeks at the turn of October and November 2020. The overall data is reported with a six-week lag.The funeral services association spokeswoman Hanka Svěchotová said numbers were now “reaching a somewhat critical level”.The situation appeared uneven across the country, with the capital Prague’s funeral service telling Reuters it was operating as normal.The crematorium in the eastern city of Ostrava as well as the hospital in the nearby city of Olomouc, however, have placed freezer trucks outside to store bodies.New daily cases may peak at around 19,000 in the coming week, up from Tuesday’s record of 17,278, the country’s chief health statistician said on Wednesday. Israel expects to receive its first shipment of Moderna coronavirus vaccines on Thursday and will administer them to people confined to homes or otherwise unable to go to clinics, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.His statement, issued late on Wednesday, did not detail the size of the shipment. Moderna said on Monday that Israel had approved the vaccine, securing 6m doses.US health and human services secretary Alex Azar has said states should not let recommendations to prioritise certain groups like essential workers slow the pace of Covid-19 vaccinations.“Those are simply recommendations, and they should never stand in the way of getting shots in arms,” Azar said at a press conference for the Operation Warp Speed vaccination programme.If states are struggling to distribute the vaccine “then by all means you want to be opening up to people 70 and over or 65 and over,” he said.Portugal’s president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has tested negative for Covid-19 after being in contact with someone who is infected and will not stay in self-isolation as the exposure was considered low risk, his office has said.The 72-year-old is campaigning to win a second term as the country’s president in an election on 24 January. He has several presidential debates scheduled before then, including one this evening which will go ahead as planned.“Following the decision by the health authority, the president, who has already tested negative today, will resume his work schedule,” his office said in a statement.Rebelo de Sousa’s office said the contact happened on Monday with a member of Casa Civil, a body of specialists who provide consultation services to the president. Bars and restaurants in Ireland are likely to remain closed due to Covid-19 restrictions until the end of March, Ireland’s deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar said.“If I was running a business now, I would be thinking that it’s a probability that I’ll be closed until the end of March,” Varadkar said when asked about bars and restaurants.Current public health measures are due to be reviewed at the end of January, but Varadkar said the country was not going to be “out of the woods” by then. Ireland is to drop a ban on travellers from Britain and South Africa from Saturday and will instead require them on arrival to provide a negative Covid-19 test from the previous 72 hours, transport minister Eamon Ryan said.The measure will remain in place at least until the end of January and the government will consider whether to impose the same measure on other countries with high levels of Covid-19 infection, Ryan told a news conference. Bolivia has granted emergency approval for use of Russia’s Sputnik vaccine against Covid-19, Russian sovereign fund RDIF said.The vaccine was registered by the Bolivian regulator based on the results of Phase III clinical trials in Russia, without additional trials in Bolivia, RDIF said in a statement.RDIF said on 30 December it had agreed to supply Bolivia with enough of its two-dose Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to vaccinate 2.6 million people. Swiss health authorities have added Denmark and the Netherlands to their list of areas from which travellers must enter a 10-day quarantine designed to curb the spread of Covid-19.The Czech Republic and Panama also join the list that takes effect from 15 January. Belize and the Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia come off the list from Thursday. Ireland has ordered the closure of most schools and construction sites for at least three weeks in an effort to curb a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections, tightening a lockdown that has already closed most hospitality and retail outlets.The government has also banned ‘click and collect’ retail services but will continue to allow deliveries, prime minister Micheal Martin told a news conference."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451634.1609951853!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"online shopping from the uk delivers financial shocks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen shopping online from a UK business, contact the business before check-out to see if it operates as DAP or DDP and if it is VAT registered in the State. Photograph: iStockTowards the end of 2020, the double-edged sword of Covid-19 and Brexit pierced the armour of both An Post and the Royal Mail. They saw unprecedented levels of demand and a lack of clarity on changes from what was then a still uncertain trade deal between the EU and UK.On December 31st, in that confused climate, I ordered some items from a retailer in England at a cost of £86.50 (€96). At the time of ordering, Royal Mail had suspended postal orders to Europe due to the uncertainty of any changes Brexit might bring so the only option available was a £15 courier. I went with it.On the morning of Tuesday, January 5th, a courier service sent me an email to say it was delivering my items. The email said import dutytax payment of €38 was due. There was €25.50 in VAT and another €14.50 for an “advanced paymenthandling charge”. When I asked the courier company to explain the latter charge more clearly, they did not get back to me. “We’ve had more questions in the early part of January than we have had in December which we hadn’t anticipated.”Davies believes there is a lack of education for customers regarding payments, particularly when it comes to the unfamiliar terms of Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) and Delivered At Place (DAP). With DDP, the buyer is responsible for just the unloading of goods while the seller takes responsibility for customs clearance, duties, taxes and everything else relating to the order. DAP, however, sees the buyer taking responsibility for customs, duties, taxes as well as unloading. “In hindsight, I recognise my mistake was not to identify those terms and start educating customers about them,” Davies says.While these new terms may not be familiar to the public, he says the consequences of the UK’s departure from the EU are more practical than financial for the Liverpool-based business.“Money always finds a way through. In the end, after a lot of worry about Brexit, I don’t think there’s been any negative impact. It’s not really a political or even economic situation, it’s more logistics.”That’s the view of one business in one part of England and that view will undoubtedly contrast with others in different parts of the UK. What is most striking, however, is the simple lack of certainty even after four years of headlines and bulletins dominated by the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum. When shopping online from a UK business, it would pay for Irish consumers to contact the business before check-out to see if it operates as DAP or DDP and if it is VAT registered in the State.It can only be hoped that things will become a little more straightforward sooner rather than later. For now, I’ll be sticking to my new year’s resolution of buying Irish unless there is absolutely no other option.Then there was Abdullahi. “Before Brexit, online shopping was very easy and deliveries arrive fast. Now I ordered a book three days ago and it says that it’s going to be delivered between the 18th and 20th of January. I also tried to order a stethoscope online and it said it cannot be delivered due to Brexit. It is very tough now.”PJ writes: “My wife bought a coat from ie.burberry on sale. There was no mention of taxes or custom charges. The charges were as follows – €100 taxes, approx €50 in custom duties, and €18 other for a €400 jacket. Refused to pay so UPS won’t release.” Ciarra ordered Charlotte Tilbury make-up on December 27 at a cost of €105. “I got a message from DHL this morning to say my package was on the way. Then I got a follow-up email to say that I had to pay €41.80, broken down, that was €14.50 advance payment?! And €27.30 VAT at import. The email said if I didn’t pay it, I wouldn’t get my package. I’m afraid to pay as I don’t know is it a scam or where they got their figures from, still no sign of the package, although it was due to be delivered today!”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451559.1609954935!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teacher union alarm over rushed and reckless move to partially reopen schools","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Cabinet has been examining plans to keep secondary schools open for three days a week for up to 60,000 Leaving Cert students. File photograph: David JonesPA Unions representing school staff have expressed alarm over the Government’s “rushed and reckless” decision to keep schools open for special needs and Leaving Cert students.The Cabinet agreed on Wednesday to keep secondary schools open for three days a week for up to 60,000 Leaving Cert students from next Monday.In addition, special schools and special classes will reopen for an estimated 15,000 pupils.However, the three teachers’ unions said they have serious reservations over the health implications for their members, while union representing special needs assistants said the decision was unworkable.Crucially, none have yet signalled that they will take industrial action or instruct members not to turn up for work next week.Instead, they are seeking further meetings with the depart ment and access to public health advice.John Boyle, the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation’s general secretary, questioned how it will be safe for staff or children to attend special education settings.“The rushed plan as laid out today is reckless and takes unnecessary risks which could easily be avoided. In light of public health advice, it is questionable whether attendance at such premises will be other than minimal,” he said.The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) said it had not been provided with a “credible level of assurance by the Government that schools will be safe places” next week. “The union has no access to medical data demonstrating that schools are sufficiently safe for students and teachers at this time, in the context of the new variant and the alarmingly high numbers,” it said, in a statement.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland said it was “ gravely concerned” the Government’s “ premature decision” which was “ deeply damaging to the trust and confidence that has allowed us to keep schools open since September. “Our members do not have trust and confidence that opening schools to Leaving Certificate students as is proposed can be safely achieved under the current circumstances,” said TUI president Martin Marjoram.“We are seriously concerned by both the health and safety risks and logistical problems posed by this move at this time.” He said further engagement with public health representatives was urgently required. Andy Pike, head of education at trade union Fórsa which represents thousands of special needs assistants, said reopening special schools and classes as normal “presents challenges that just cannot be met”.He said feedback from its members indicated that “many will not be able to attend work due to a lack of childcare and valid safety concerns”.Mr Pike added that a limited service could be provided through “structured remote supports” or a programme which resembles summer support programmes.Under the Government’s decision, teachers will be authorised to access school buildings to support remote learning or face to face teaching as needed and the 5km travel restriction will not apply.Unions were informed during meetings with the department that childcare provision would be made for special education staff, though they said there was no clarity on how this would work.However, apeaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the latest public health advice the Government has received indicated that schools remain safe settings.He said the Chief Medical Officer’s advice was that the main public health risk to reopening schools centred on the mobilisation of more than one million students and teachers.This led to the Government’s decision to shut schools for most students during January, with “limited exceptions” for 61,000 Leaving Cert students and up to 15,000 students with special needs .Minister for Education Norma Foley said the decision has been made in the best interests of students, especially those facing into exams and with learning disabilities.She said schools and teachers had proved resilient in the past in reopening schools and she was convinced the education sector will “not be found wanting” in reopening again in a limited way.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Company delivered 14m parcels in December, double that of 2019About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this weekThe first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heating"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450007.1609793884!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why is ireland s covid vaccination campaign off to such a slow start","story":"December 29th, 2020: Dublin grandmother Annie Lynch (79) became the first person in the Republic to receive the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday afternoon.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireWith coronavirus numbers out of control in Ireland and many other countries, there will inevitably be intense focus on progress made by governments in vaccinating their populations against Covid-19.In 12 months’ time, the difference between a slow and a fast rollout of vaccines here will probably be measurable in terms of the loss of hundreds of lives, along with tens of thousands of jobs.So far Ireland has got off to a slow start, leaving the Government and health officials open to accusations of sluggishness and delay. By the end of December one in every 2,500 people had been vaccinated, compared with one in eight in Israel and one in 80 or so in the US and the UK. By that date 1,800 Irish people had been immunised, according to Our World in Data, compared with more than 40,000 in Denmark, a country with a slightly bigger population than our own.The criticisms will only intensify as soaring case numbers heap further pressure on the health service and force much of society to remain shut. The best answer to them is to make serious inroads into vaccinating the population, but this is contingent of there being enough supply.This, in turn, depends on authorisations from EU and Irish regulators, which have tended to lag behind other jurisdictions so far. Another factor is the size of the order made by the EU on behalf of member states for inidual vaccines.It was only after serious pressure from Germany that the European Medicines Agency brought forward its decision last month on the PfizerBionNTech vaccine, and now it is due to make a decision on the Moderna vaccine in the coming days.The agency is not alone among regulators in having issues with the application by OxfordAstra Zeneca for its vaccine, and its requirement for extra data to be provided has pushed back a decision on this until February.Workhorse vaccineThe problem is that this vaccine was conceived as the workhorse of European vaccination programmes, because it is cheap, easy to transport and works in a way similar to existing vaccines, unlike the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna treatments, which use novel technology.The EU went for a strategy of not putting all its eggs in the one basket by placing orders for six different vaccines. It may also, with the benefit of hindsight, have spent too long haggling over price. A number of last year’s likely contenders got delayed, and regulatory decisions moved slowly, leaving the bloc with insufficient orders for the vaccine that was out of the traps first, PfizerBioNTech.As a result, there is little point in the Irish vaccination programme “getting ahead of itself” until a secure and ample pipeline of vaccines comes on stream. Until that happens, we will have to make the best use of what we have. The UK has delayed the second dose of the vaccine so that a greater number can be administered a first dose and so enjoy the partial protection this offers. This approach has split scientific opinion. Even the drug manufacturers are ided, with Pfizer resolutely opposed to any delay in administering a second dose of its vaccine and AstraZeneca more favourably disposed to the idea.For now, this approach has been ruled out in Ireland but another idea we may adopt from the UK is to extract six doses from a vial of PfizerBionNTech vaccine rather than the recommended five. When the right needle is used, the content of the dose can be split six ways, rather than being used five times and leaving some fluid over. This could potentially increase productivity by up to 20 per cent.Who’s the boss?Some countries have decided to start their vaccination programme with working-age adults rather than vulnerable care home residents, but this approach is unlikely to find favour in Ireland.At this point, it is difficult to tell who is running the vaccine rollout programme here. Is it the Department of Health, which has decided the public health response during the pandemic? Or the HSE, which is administering the vaccinations? Or the taskforce that drew up an implementation plan and is still active?While the UK started administering the OxfordAstra Zeneca vaccine at 7.30am on Monday, Irish journalists seeking updates on supplies of the Moderna vaccine here were being referred by the Department of Health to the HSE, and by the HSE to the department. A plan for vaccinations in nursing homes was delayed on Monday, seemingly over consent issues. GPs are still wondering when they and their staff will be immunised.At least Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was able to announce an increase in this week’s vaccination target from 20,000 to 35,000.None of these early teething issues will matter in the long run, hopefully, but greater clarity would do no harm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451459.1609951250!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"aengus mac grianna apologises over blasphemous new year s eve sketch","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn a tweet Aengus Mac Grianna said he wished to apologise for the sketch. “Truly I am deeply sorry for the offence, distress and hurt caused.

Image: iStock.The construction industry is “redoubling” efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on sites since the Christmas period, but expects the Government to restrict activity following a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.Tom Parlon, director general of the Construction Industry Federation, said he was shocked to learn that the Government was considering closing down the sector in an attempt to control the recent spike.The Cabinet is expected to order that nearly all construction work should stop until the end of the month, with exceptions for social housing, urgent repairs and critical projects.“Due to the escalating situation of Covid-19, the construction industry understand that the Government will decide to restrict activity,” Mr Parlon told The . “The nature of those restrictions is still not clear and clarity is urgently required.”Mr Parlon said the industry has had “an excellent track record” at keeping Covid-19 off sites and managing it when on site. “At no point were combined cases over 56 during the previous nine months,” he said.“The rate of infection per employee industry-wide ranged from 0.003 per cent to 0.035 per cent during this period amongst our 147,000 employees. This is considerably below the population average at all times.“Companies are redoubling their efforts to preventscreen Covid from being imported from the community after the Christmas period.“Testing, screening and constant communication with sub-contractors and employees is underway. The message is if you are a close contact or exhibit any symptoms do not show up to work.”Mr Parlon pointed out that the spike in Covid-19 incidence occurred during the recent “relaxation phase” and during a period “when industry wasn’t open”.“The HSE are constantly monitoring incidence on site through their steering committee,” he said. “Construction sites are recognised as positive in terms of managing and mitigating Covid-19 thus helping prevent the spread due to its world class standard operating procedure.“Finally, no other country – barring some US states and Italy in the initial wave – have shut down construction during lockdowns. Most recently, the UK and Scotland have entered lockdown and left construction operational.Output droppedMr Parlon said that during the first lockdown, when most work in the sector was halted, about 5,000 homes had not been built and output had dropped by 10 per cent at a cost of €3 billion to the industry and the economy.During discussions in recent days, Mr Parlon said he had been assured that the construction of housing and work on educational projects would continue.“We will continue to work with the HSE, the HSA and the wider Government on monitoring the situation and will follow the advice as provided by these bodies,” Mr Parlon added.Construction worker Brendan Hennessy told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland there had been no issues on the sites he had worked on from when activity resumed after the first lockdown up to Christmas.He said workers were clocking in at different times, following one way systems, using canteens at different time and that everything worked well.He said, in his experience, workers were not car pooling and people were not allowed on to sites without having their temperature checked.Developer Michael O’Flynn told the same programme he appreciated how serious the Covid-19 situation has become in recent week.However, he questioned why it would be seen as safe to build social housing but not private housing, with an exception expected to be given for one over the other.Mr O’Flynn said the impact of a shutdown for people awaiting a home should be considered and said there should be a consistency in the approach.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451546.1609943921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"yellow alert issued by met %C3%A9ireann as values set to plunge to 4","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMet Éireann said it will turn bitterly cold once again on Friday night under long clear spells with lows of -1 to -5 degrees.

The new measures will be in place until “at least the end of January” , Taoiseach Micheál Martin said. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar suggested some restrictions could remain in place past February 1st. “If I was running a business now, I would be thinking there’s a probability I’ll be closed until the end of March,” he said. He said the regulations would be reviewed at the end of January, but warned “the situation is deteriorating... we won’t be out of the woods by the end of January”. The main measures are:- Schools closed except for Leaving Certs ans Special education- Childcare only open for essential workers and vulnerable children- Click and collect from non-essential retail no longer allowed- Ban on travellers from UK and South Africa lifted but must provide PCR test - PUP and other pandemic payments to continue until March Dig Deep We “must dig deep within ourselves and face the coming month with steely determination and resolve”, he said after the Cabinet meeting.“We have risen to all the challenges that have presented themselves… we may now be entering the most challenging phase of all,” he said. “The personal decisions we make....Will directly affect how many more people get sick and how many people die”.“We are in a battle against deadly and ever changing virus,” he said. “ Unless you are involved in absolutely essential work you have no reason to be away from your home,” he said. Ministers agreed that all Leaving Cert students will be permitted to attend school for three days a week from next week. Schools will close for other children with learning moving online. However Cabinet agreed to keep special schools and special classes in mainstream schools open for an estimated 15,000 pupils.“While all the scientific and public health evidence shows (they) remain safe environments.. the spread of the virus has got to the point where we have to stop as much mobility as we can,” Mr Martin said. ChildcareCabinet agreed that essential workers will be allowed to form a bubble with another household in order to provide childcare if they do not have an existing arrangement, under plans discussed by the Cabinet. Childcare services, including regulated childminders and other childcare arrangements, will be permitted to continue to provide services but only for vulnerable children and children of essential workers.ConstructionCabinet agreed that non-essential construction work will have to finish at 6pm on Friday. However, plans to allow what sources described as a “very limited” subset of construction activity continue. Work on social housing that is nearly completion will be permitted, but only if it satisfies set criteria, sources said. Large infrastructure projects, understood to include the likes of the National Children’s Hospital and large school building projects, will continue, and emergency maintenance or repair work by plumbers, electricians and gas workers will be allowed continue.TravelCabinet also agreed that a ban on travel from Britain and South Africa will be be lifted this coming Saturday. But passengers must provide a negative PCR test from the previous 72 hours and isolate for 14 days on arrival. This requirement will then be rolled out to all incoming passengers.Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said failure to provide a negaative test be subject to a fine of up to 2,500 or six months imprisonment. He said the Cabinet has agreed provisionally to apply these restrictions to other red list countries He said this will be very difficult for the travel industry and for iniduals who may have plans for travelThe Cabinet also agreed that click and collect services for non-essential retail outlets will no longer be permitted with immediate effect in what will be a big blow for the sector. Click and deliver will continue to be permitted.Getting worseThe meeting came against a backdrop of a significant rise in cases of the disease and with hospitals generally and intensive care units coming under pressure. A further 5,325 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 17 deaths were reported on Tuesday and the number of people in hospital being treated for the disease hit a new high of 921 on Wednesday. Mr Martin urged people to remember Mariter Tarugo, the Philippines native who worked at a healthcare assistant at St Vincent’s Hospital and died with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve. Tánaiste Leo Vardkar said “This is bad, it’s getting worse, and we’re only beginning to see the impact on our hospitals”“We’re facing into what’s going to be a really dark January. a third wave that could be much worse than the first… hosps and ICUs not overwhelmed in the first wave are at serious risk of being so this month”He said various schemes including Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be put in place. They were engaging with the banks to ensure payment breaks for mortgage holders and those with loans“January is the month in which we all stay in,” he said. Minister for Culture Catherine Martin’s officials have engaged with RTÉ, TG4 and the Department of Education about restarting learning from home programmes immediately.However, the schools plan is likely to meet with opposition from some trade unions. Andy Pike, head of education at the trade union Forsa - which represents most special needs assistants, said reopening special schools and classes as normal “presents challenges that just cannot be met”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451660.1609955160!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid restrictions q a what are the latest changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAll schools will close for three weeks from Monday. File photograph: PA Q: We are at Level 5. Why is there a need for more restrictions?A: The dramatic escalation of the outbreak has forced the Government to take further drastic action in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. With daily numbers rising from the low hundreds in early December to thousands in early January and peaking at 6,000 on Sunday – and with hospital admissions increasing alarmingly – something needed to be done.Q: So what are the main changes?A: The closure of schools for the month of January is the biggest change. Even when most other activity was being shut down in the face of rising numbers, the Government was determined to keep schools open. Last week it delayed reopening schools by three days until next Monday, January 11th. But at the Cabinet meeting Ministers accepted that the new data made the case for schools closure inarguable. Taoiseach Micheál Martin accepted it was a reluctant decision because “education is the great equaliser”. But he said keeping education open involved “one million people on the move” daily.So all schools will close for three weeks from Monday with a review at the end of January. There are exceptions. Leaving Certificate students will be allowed to attend school for three days a week, with remote learning on the other two days. In addition, there will be arrangements put in place to allow children with special needs attend classes.For all other primary and secondary students, the month of January will involve home schooling and remote learning.Q: Will the Leaving Certificate be cancelled?A: The answer to that at this moment in time is no. The fact that Leaving Certificate students are being allowed to attend school for three days a week signals an intention by Government that it wants the exams to proceed this year. This puts the State policy at variance with that in Northern Ireland where its Minister of Education Peter Weir announced earlier on Wednesday that neither A-level exams (equivalent to Leaving Certificate) nor GCSE exams (equivalent to Junior Certificate) will take place this year. The Republic’s Minister for Education Norma Foley said she is confident the Junior Certificate can go ahead.Q: And what about the other sectors?A: The other big sector which has continued through most of the pandemic since last March is construction. However, all but a small section of the industry will shut down at 6pm on Friday with the situation to be reviewed at the end of the month. The exception is that deemed essential – these projects include social housing developments, schools and the National Children’s Hospital.Q: Has non-essential retail also been hit?A: Unfortunately yes. And this will affect smaller retailers who do not have the capacity to operate online delivery services. The click and collect service provided a big boon to many retailers during the restrictions that were in place in the run-up to Christmas. But the rationale behind the new restrictions is to reduce movement and travel by as much as possible. Invariably, people were driving to retail centres and town centres to collect their purchases. The Government is trying to minimise such movements.Q: Is the travel ban from the UK and South Africa being lifted?A: Yes it is. The two highly transmissible new variants have been identified in the UK and in South Africa and many countries have implemented travel bans. An outright ban, said Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, has not been encouraged by the European Union. Instead, from Saturday the ban will be lifted but it will be replaced by a new regime.Anyone travelling to Ireland from Britain (but not Northern Ireland) will be required to produce a PCR test (used to detect the presence of an antigen) showing they are clear from Covid (taken not more than 72 hours before arriving). There will be stringent penalties for failure to provide evidence of a test (with fines of €2,500 or six months imprisonments for failure to comply).Q: Will childcare continue?A: Only on a limited basis for children of workers who are deemed as essential. It will also be available to vulnerable children. A new category of bubble has been created to assist families in these categories with young children. A household of an essential worker which has no existing childcare arrangements can form a bubble with another household for the purpose of providing childcare.Q: So what supports will be available?A: The Government decided at the Cabinet meeting to extend all the schemes to the end of March (Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Employment Wage Support Scheme and supports to businesses that are closed).

Photograph: World Health OrganisationAFP via Getty Images.China has blocked the arrival of a team from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that is investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that their visas had not yet been approved even as some members of the group were on their way.WHO\u0026nbspdirector general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed his dismay at the move and said he had called on China to allow the team in.“I’m very disappointed with this news, given that two members have already begun their journeys, and others were not able to travel at the last minute,” he said.“But I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials. And I have once again made made it clear that the mission is a priority for WHO and the international team.”The WHO has been attempting to send in the team of global experts from a number of countries for some months. It has been talking with Chinese officials since July. Scientists have long said it is essential to find out how the virus jumped species into humans.The expedition to China was heading to Wuhan to investigate the earliest cases. It was not intending to probe claims that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, which have been dismissed by most scientists.The mission has been criticised by the US, where the outgoing president, Donald Trump, has categorically blamed the Chinese for the pandemic.Garrett Grigsby, of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in November the investigation appeared to be “inconsistent” with the WHO’s mandate.‘Transparent’“Understanding the origins of Covid-19 through a transparent and inclusive investigation is what must be done to meet the mandate.”Dr Mike Ryan, an Irish-born offcial at the WHO, said the team had been working very closely with Chinese colleagues when planning the trip.Two members of the team, who had a long distance to travel, had begun their journeys, he said, but it had become clear that their visas had not been approved by the Chinese authorities.“We did not want to put people in the air unnecessarily if there wasn’t a guarantee of their arrival in China being successful,” said Dr Ryan. “Dr Tedros has taken immediate action and has spoken with senior Chinese officials and has fully impressed upon them the absolute critical nature of this.”The team hoped it was “just a logistical and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly”. One of the two colleagues who were on their way had gone back, while the other was remaining in a third country in transit.“This is frustrating and, as the director general said, disappointing. That disappointment has been expressed very clearly by Dr Tedros directly to our counterparts in China. We trust that in good faith, we can solve these issues in the coming hours and recommence the deployment of the team as urgently as possible,” said Dr Ryan.Ilona Kickbusch, the founding director and chair of the Global Health Centre in Geneva, said geopolitics had got in the way of countries joining together to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and the hostilities that had been generated could now get in the way of finding out how it began.“I think it will be incredibly difficult to be able to find the origin of the virus, because so much time has passed,” Ms Kickbusch said.Come togetherThe world managed to come together to eradicate smallpox at the height of the cold war, she pointed out. Even when Sars, another coronavirus, surfaced in China and caused havoc between 2002 and 2003, the global reaction had been one of cooperation and a push for more transparency.Back then, Beijing had acknowledged it had made mistakes, reorganised its health ministry and created the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Other countries had given it the benefit of the doubt and called for more cooperation.But now, she said: “There is a closing of the mind, quite clearly, on all sides.”Before the crisis, geopolitical tensions had bled into the global health response, she said, pointing to how the US-China trade war had morphed into a “geopolitical blame game”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451695.1609957181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"calls on israel to extend coronavirus vaccination programme to palestinians","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Chef presents a  cake to a customer at a bakery in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip.   In Gaza there have been  43,134 reported coronavirus cases, with 404 fatalities. Photograph: Mohammed AbedAFPGetty   As Israel presses ahead with its coronavirus vaccination programme, a number of human rights groups have called on the country to also provide doses to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.Amnesty International said that denying Covid-19 vaccines to Palestinians exposed Israel’s “institutionalised discrimination”.“The Israeli government must stop ignoring its international obligations as an occupying power and immediately act to ensure that Covid-19 vaccines are equally and fairly provided to Palestinians living under its occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, ” the organisation said in a statement issued on Wednesday. “There could hardly be a better illustration of how Israeli lives are valued above Palestinian ones.” Separately, a group of some 200 rabbis signed a petition by the Rabbis for Human Rights organisation, calling on the Israeli government to hasten the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines amongst the Palestinian population.The rabbis cited medieval Jewish scholar Maimonides who wrote that it is a religious obligation to save other human beings, saying it was a moral imperative for Israel to act immediately, especially in Gaza, over which, the rabbis asserted, Israel exercises extensive control.With more than half a million Israelis now vaccinated – more than 15 per cent of the population– the country leads the world in its inoculation drive, but the only Palestinians to have received the jab are residents of east Jerusalem. Currently there are no plans to extend the drive to Palestinians in the West Bank or Gaza, even though Jewish settlers in the West Bank, as Israeli citizens, have been vaccinated. Israel has so far has not received a request for assistance from either the Palestinian Authority (PA), which controls most of the population in the West Bank, or from the Hamas authorities in Gaza. Sharp spikeUnder the terms of the Oslo peace accords, the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah is responsible for the healthcare of its own population. The PA says it has applied to the World Health Organisation and the United Nations for help with obtaining vaccines. On Monday the Palestinian health ministry said it expects to receive its first vaccine doses next month.The PA health ministry has confirmed more than 100,000 Covid cases in the West Bank, including 1,100 deaths. In Gaza, there were 43,134 reported cases, with 404 fatalities.Although Israel is leading the world in terms of population percentage vaccinated, the December 19th rollout came too late to prevent a sharp spike in infections, prompting the government to order a strict lockdown beginning on Thursday at midnight. Vaccinations are due to run out in a few days and from next week the only vaccinations administered for the time being will be the second dose for people who have already received the first Pfizer- BioNTech jab.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4385961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us on course for a less than revolutionary administration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Radical laws and sharp ruptures from the status quo require either decisive majorities or support from the other side. A ided electorate allows for neither.’As ever, Tom Wolfe got there first. Readers had expected the author of The Bonfire of the Vanities to “do” Los Angeles or Chicago after his treatment of 1980s New York. Instead, the place that drew his fine eye for trends was Atlanta. A Man in Full considered the city, and the state that it anchors, as America’s potential future. Some 23 years on, Georgia continues to grow in population as several other states shrink. Once uncompetitively Republican, it is now the nation’s political schism in miniature.Nowhere was closer-fought in the US presidential election two months ago. If the Democrats take both of its Senate seats, to go with Joe Biden’s win there, imagine the symbolism. Here is a party going with the grain of the nation’s evolution.But not, it is worth saying, a party with a suddenly free hand. A split Senate, with the vice-president casting decisive votes, does not assure Biden a radical presidency. His chances of that waned when the “blue wave” of congressional gains failed to materialise in November. His subsequent nominations to the executive – their mildness, their familiarity – admit as much. His flirtations with the left are just a few months old but feel a century ago. His first problem is that a Senate majority is only as good as its internal cohesion. Conservative Democrats are not the force they were but, in a tight vote, it takes just a few to scuttle progressive dreams. West Virginia’s Joe Manchin is one who has to mind his red-state electors. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Georgia-like in its competitiveness, has no more incentive to rile swing- or right-leaning voters.Any defections on his own side would leave Biden exposed to Republican intransigence. What hope there was of a more co-operative party post-November is embarrassing to recall now. In its bogusness and tenacity, Donald Trump’s quest to overturn his election defeat somehow intensifies by the week. Nothing in his presidency became him less than the leaving of it.But leave it he will. It is the conduct of the Republicans who remain in Washington that promises an ordeal for Biden. A dozen or so senators plan to contest the certification of the election result. That is more than a fifth of the Republicans there. Estimates of like-minded colleagues in the lower chamber exceed 100.And this is three years ahead of a presidential nomination race that will only incentivise such pandering to right-wing grassroots. Some of those activists will march against certification on Wednesday. A party that will not grant the president-elect’s legitimacy is not going to consider his legislation on its merits. Clinton and Obama And so the US is on course for a less than revolutionary administration. But then it has known no other for some time. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were supernaturally gifted politicians. Both lost Congress at their first mid-term elections, and their domestic programmes with it. Clinton did not even have a landmark statute to show for two years of unified government. As for Trump, he secured a tax cut before losing the House of Representatives at the first time of asking – never to recover.Come to think of it, no US administration since the 1980s could be described as transformative, at least on the home front. Presidents still have their executive orders and discretion in foreign affairs. But social change on the Lyndon Johnson-Ronald Reagan scale tends to entail legislation, and lots of it. With the exception of Obamacare, the boldest versions have not survived Washington’s sieve in recent decades.The evidence nudges us to a conclusion that is no less true for its perverseness. The real winners of the age of partisanship are those who hate it most. The winners are the moderates. Radical laws and sharp ruptures from the status quo require either decisive majorities or support from the other side. A ided electorate allows for neither. America’s bifurcation, once it feeds into legislative numbers and conduct, puts paid to grand schemes. Voters in the middle find themselves in the oddest of predicaments: scandalised by the viciousness of politics and yet served by its results.“Moderate”, to be clear, is not a synonym for “good”. This time last year, immoderate measures against the coronavirus pandemic would have saved lives. Splitting the difference on Trump’s attempt to stay in office would be a nonsense. Equidistance from opposing arguments is no guarantor of sound policy. It is with surprise, then, not elation, that we should record this oddity of modern politics. Our era is one of extreme sentiments and loyalties. It is not always one of extreme outcomes. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: More than 1,000 Covid deaths in highest UK toll since AprilReading knife killer \u0026#39was not terrorist because he drank alcohol and smoked\u0026#39 his lawyer claimsWhat next for Donald Trump\u0026#39s children, after Joe Biden\u0026#39s inauguration?

going to win the race to administer two million doses per week first – the vaccines or the virus?At the moment the clever money is on the latter after the Office for National Statistics estimated that more than one in 50 of the entire population of the country was infected with Covid last week.That’s easily more than a million people and with an R value well above one and the new super-infectious strain at its disposal, our viral foe continues to accelerate its roll-out across the UK.By comparison, vaccine shots have been delivered to about 1.3 million people so far at a rate of about 300,000 per week. It is clearly good news that nearly a quarter of the highly vulnerable over-80 age group has had an injection, but that still means that more than three quarters have not.We should also remember that the virus has a three-week built-in advantage – that’s the time lag between someone getting a shot in the arm and developing the maximum immunity that their first jab can offer (though resistance to serious disease may come a little sooner).The strict new national lockdown, imposed after viral transmission went up through the gears and and smashed through the tiers, is our one hope of slowing it down. But the virus has already had several further days to multiply since the ONS collated the data it published yesterday.Depending on the age profile of those getting infected, we can expect each million new cases to result in about 30,000 fresh hospitalisations and 5,000 extra deaths. Over the next month or two the NHS will be doing very well indeed to get recovered patients out of hospital anywhere near as fast as sick ones are coming in.All of which means that an enormous burden of responsibility rests on the shoulders of vaccine roll-out minister Nadhim Zahawi and everyone else working on the great inoculation effort. In this context, it is not only the right of the media to scour the entire operation – from manufacture to distribution to injection – for any weaknesses, but its duty, too.As Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4’s Mishal Husain this morning: “You are absolutely right to press me on this.”The ’s James Rothwell yesterday wrote an eye-opening dispatch from Jerusalem about Israel’s phenomenal vaccination programme. Despite having a population just a seventh of Britain’s, it has carried out as many jabs – already inoculating the majority of citizens in the high-risk groups in a network of centres that stay open for 14 hours a day. Four competing Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) race against each other to carry out the most vaccinations. “There is a sense that people are making history and that they are on a mission, a national effort, to come out of this,” one nurse told him.That is the spirit that Mr Zahawi must seek to engender here. Is he yet succeeding? Well, put it this way, you wouldn’t want Public Health England (PHE) to be in charge of organising the proverbial raid on Entebbe.The  today reveals that PHE, which has a key role in the logistical side of the vaccination effort, sent guidance to NHS trusts warning them not to expect deliveries on Sundays or after agreed lunchtime “cut-off points”, even if supplies are running low (though a PHE source has said exceptions would be made if there were a genuine risk of running out). Orders sent on Saturday afternoons will not be delivered until the following Tuesday, according to documents seen by the . PHE may yet move to a seven-day schedule in due course.Britain’s network of 11,000 pharmacies – most of which are well used to taking part in the regular autumn ’flu jab programme – is also feeling under-utilised and pointing out that it has the potential to deliver more than a million vaccine doses a week on its own.Meanwhile, there are also whispers that staffing levels at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are not sufficient to conduct essential quality control tests on batches of vaccine at maximum speed.Boris Johnson said at his press conference yesterday that “the rate-limiting factor at the moment is making sure that we can get enough vaccine where we want it fast enough” rather than at the sharp end of clinic capacity.His commitment to move from weekly updates on the numbers inoculated to daily ones from Monday was hugely welcome, bringing with it a further remorseless glare of public and media scrutiny about the need for speed.One shouldn’t for a second doubt the dedication and commitment of the vast majority of those involved in the vaccination effort. But lions must not be led by donkeys. In decades to come those taking part will look back on these testing weeks as the most dramatic in their entire careers. They will not wish to tell their grandchildren: “We were only allowed to work six days a week.”They will far rather say: “It meant working around the clock. You could forget about having a day off. We were in a race against time and we won it. They reckon we saved a hundred thousand lives.”Mr Zahawi today told BBC Radio 4 that when figures are published for the week from January 4 to January 11, they will show a “dramatic uplift” in the rate of vaccination. They need to. And then another one after that. That really will be an achievement worth banging a saucepan for.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"georgia senate vote winner republican democrat joe biden","story":" VP Mike Pence defies Trump in refusing to contest vote resultsPresident tells supporters that he will never concede​Meet the Democratic odd couple aiming to win Biden the SenatePolice officer who shot Jacob Blake will not face charges ​Subscribe to The  for a month-long free trial​Mike Pence, Vice President, said Wednesday that he will not intervene to stop the certification by Congress of Democrat Joe Biden\u0027s election victory,  in defiance of Donald Trump.The Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not, Pence said in a statement released as a joint session of Congress began to certify the Electoral College votes from the November 3 election.The statement was released as Trump urged Pence to decline to certify the Electoral College results.The outgoing president encouraged a crowd of supporters gathered in DC to march on the Capitol to protest. Meanwhile, Democrat challenger Raphael Warnock has beaten incumbent Republican Kelly Loeffler in one of the two Georgia run-off elections. In the second race, Democrat Jon Ossoff has also taken a narrow lead over Republican David Perdue, with 98 per cent of the vote counted.Follow the latest updates below.Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, is speaking now, saying in his 36 years in the Senate, this is the important vote he has cast. The senior Republican chastises Trump for spreading dangerous conspiracy theories and says there is no proof of illegality.We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids, says McConnell. “This election wasn’t even close.”He goes on: If this election would be overturned by merely allegations from the losing side, this nation would enter a death spiral..There would be a scramble for power at any cost. This will lead us down a poisonous path where only the winner accepts the result.As the joint session of Congress began hearing the formal count of Electoral College votes from each state the first objection has been made, Nick Allen reports. It came after the results for Arizona, one of the first states in the alphabet, were read. Mr Biden won Arizona.After the objection was made a group of Republican senators and members of Congress, including Senator Ted Cruz, stood and applauded. Mike Pence then adjourned the joint session and the Senate and House will each hold a debate on Arizona.The debates on Arizona could last up to two hours.Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) arrives for the Electoral College vote certification for President-elect Joe BidenIt appears Trump supporters have breached the Capitol building, tearing down four layers of security fencing.They are now attempting to occupy the building, fighting federal police who appear overrun. This comes minutes after the president called on those gathered at the rally in Washington DC to march to the Capitol to call on congress members to object to the electoral college vote certification.Here is a video from a journalist on the scene:Another one here:Mike Pence Vice President, has sent a letter to Members of Congress ahead of today’s Joint Session of Congress:, essentially refusing to do what President Trump is asking by contesting the certification.Pence, who has a largely formal and constitutionally prescribed role of presiding over the House and Senate, said he cannot claim unilateral authority to reject electoral votes that will make Joe Biden president. I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral voters should be counted, he writes. It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Vice President Mike Pence talk before a joint session of the House and Senate conveneA group led by US Representative Louis Gohmert has just filed for administrative stay and interim relief with the Supreme Court over the certification of the election results.Trump just encouraged the sizable crowd gathered in DC to march on the Capitol during Electoral College certification later today.The president said it will be leading the march to the Capitol where the crowd will cheer on Members of Congress in real time who object to the certification of Joe Biden.Donald Trump is speaking at the Save America rally in Washington DC. He says: “These people are not going to take it any longer. They’re not going to take it any longer.We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn\u0027t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved, he says.Donald Trump speaks to supporters from The Ellipse near the White House “Does anybody believe that Joe got 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that?” Trump asks the crowd. NO! many shout back. “He got 80m computer votes. It’s a disgrace.He says of his supporters that there has never been a movement like this, ever, ever, to crowds shouting we love Trump!Videos have been emerging all morning of Republican senators facing the wrath of angry Trump supporters, who have descended on Washington DC for the Save America rally. This one shows Trumpers shouting at Senator Todd Young of Indiana, who has not publicly given his support to the bid to oppose the election\u0027s certification in the Senate today.It’s Republican v Republican on the steps of Congress this morning, writes Ben Riley-Smith, our US Editor. A foretaste of the almighty struggle coming between the GOP’s Trumpist and traditionalist wings.Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump, including members of far-right groups, gathered in Washington in protest at a meeting of Congress on Wednesday to certify Joe Biden\u0027s victory in November\u0027s presidential election.Trump, who lost the election promised to address the protesters at the Ellipse, a park near the White House, where Biden is due to take over in two weeks.BIG CROWDS! Trump wrote on Twitter.Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u0027s personal lawyer, is warming up the huge crowd, saying he\u0027s willing to stake his reputation and Trump\u0027s reputation on there being fraud in the presidential election.Over the next 10 days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that are fraudulent, said Giuliani. If we\u0027re wrong, we will be made fools of. But if we\u0027re right, and lot of them will go to jail. So -- let\u0027s have trial by combat. President-elect Joe Biden is heralding a Democratic victory in at least one of Georgia\u0027s two US Senate runoffs as part of a resounding message, as well as good news for his agenda.“I congratulate Reverend Warnock on his groundbreaking win last night and I am hopeful that when the count is complete, Jon Ossoff will also be victorious,” Biden said.“I congratulate the people of Georgia, who turned out in record numbers once again, just as they did in November, to elect two new Senators, demand action, and call on our elected leaders to end the gridlock and move us forward as a nation.”Biden also praised the work of two prominent Georgia women in clinching Warnock’s win.“I also congratulate the twin powers of Georgia, Stacey Abrams and Keisha Lance Bottoms, who have laid the difficult groundwork necessary to encourage turnout and protect the vote over these last years.”Biden reserved particular praise for Stacey AbramsGabriel Sterling, the voting systems implementation manager for the Georgia Secretary of State\u0027s office, is giving a press conference now. Asked by a reporter whether he has seen any sign of malfeasance, the Republican says: There is no evidence of any irregularities. The biggest thing we\u0027ve seen is from the president\u0027s fertile mind, a finding of fraud where none exists.While the Democrats were out there knocking out doors, Trump was out there discouraging people from voting, he said of why he thought the two Republican candidates were performing badly.Sterling has been outspoken in his criticism for Donald Trump, who he says is propagating disinformation about election fraud in Georgia.Sterling says he anticipates that all but a few votes will be counted by 1 pm local time (6pm UK) and that Ossoff will very likely defeat Perdue.He told  journalists that it is looking like Ossoff will win by more than half a percentage point, thus avoiding a recount.

Senate Democrats know America is hurting,” he added, signalling that the Democrats will make a beefed coronavirus relief bill their top priority.Sen Schumer will replace Mitch McConnell as the Senate Majority Leader, a fact former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton seemed to enjoy on Twitter.Donald Trump will be leaving office on January 20 when Joe Biden is inaugurated, but his plans to leave the USA to go golfing in Scotland on January 19 appear to have been scuppered by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Ms Sturgeon has warned the President that golf does not constitute an \u0027essential\u0027 reason for travel and as such, were he to come to Scotland to play, he would be in breach of Covid rules.As we continue looking ahead to a Biden presidency, Rozina Sabur explores how Jill Biden will take to the role of First Lady.Jill Biden spent eight years serving as the Second Lady during the Obama administration, but her highly personal nine-minute live address at the Democratic Convention in August, from an empty classroom at the high school where she used to teach, was her first formal introduction to most of the American public.A self-professed introvert, Dr Biden has always been reticent about entering the political spotlight, although she is often described as Joe Biden\u0027s biggest defender and one of his best assets. She is also said to be one of his most trusted political advisers, reportedly playing a pivotal role in helping Mr Biden narrow down his list of potential running mates.READ MORE: Who is First Lady Dr Jill Biden - and how will she take to the role?The President is awake and tweeting, and has reacted to Jon Ossoff\u0027s declaration of victory over David Perdue with typical good grace and decorum.As we enter the final two weeks of Donald Trump\u0027s presidency, Dominic Penna our video team take a look back at his tumultuos four years in office.Since his victory in 2016 and inauguration in 2017, Donald Trump has been at the helm of one of the most unconventional and eventful presidencies in recent memory.From the inauguration crowd size controversy, to meeting Kim Jong-un and swearing in three Supreme Court justices, Mr Trump ploughed ahead with his unique style of leadership which sometimes stumped even the most seasoned of Washington correspondents.To round off his term in office, Mr Trump faced both an impeachment, a devastating pandemic in the months leading up to the 2020 election, and most recently, a controversial phone call with Georgia\u0027s Secretary of State in an attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u0027s victory in the state.READ MORE:  Donald Trump\u0027s presidency: The best and worst moments from his four years as US President Stacey Abrams has tweeted her congratulations to Jon Ossoff, who just a few moments ago, declared victory in his Senate race against David Perdue.Jon Ossoff will stand for all of Georgia in the fight for healthcare, jobs + justice. And our nation will be all the better for having him, she tweeted. Congratulations!Donald Trump\u0027s son Eric has said this morning that the MAGA Movement started by his father is going nowhere.He also issued a stark warning to any Republican who votes to certify the results of the election in Congress today, saying any senator or any congressman on this side that does not fight tomorrow, I’m telling you will not, their political career is over because the MAGA movement is going nowhere.Democrat Jon Ossoff has declared victory over Republican David Perdue in the second run-off election in Georgia.In a video released on Twitter, the former documentary film maker thanked the people of Georgia and urged people to Let\u0027s unite now to beat this virus and rush economic relief to the people of our state and the American people.No networks or major news outlets have called the race for Mr Ossoff as yet and his opponent has not yet conceded.Hours after winning one of Georgia\u0027s high-stakes runoffs, Rev. Raphael Warnock says people in his state are feeling a sense of hope this morning.Speaking in a round of morning television interviews, he said his victory pushes against the grain of so many expectations, but this is America and I want some young person who\u0027s watching this to know anything\u0027s possible.Georgia is now in an incredible place when you think of the arc of our history, he said.This is the reversal of the old southern strategy that sought to ide people, Rev. Warnock said on ABC\u0027s \u0027Good Morning America\u0027. In this moment we\u0027ve got to bring people together to do the hard work and I look forward to doing that.He told NBC\u0027s \u0027Today\u0027 that we can ill-afford to be ided. And I hope to be the pastor among peers in the United States Senate to appeal to the better angels of our nature and to remind us that Dr. King was right, we\u0027re tied of a single garment of destiny.Joe Biden is expected to be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, writes Verity Bowman.Despite ongoing tensions with Donald Trump over the 2020 Election, the traditional outdoor ceremony is set to go ahead - though the coronavirus pandemic could scale back the usual celebrations.READ MORE: ​Inauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and what will it look like during Covid-19?Although the result has yet to be confirmed, it seems as though Democrats will take control of the Senate, meaning their arch-nemesis in Congress Mitch McConnell will have a new job title.Mr McConnell, a Senator from Kentucky, has spent much of the last six years blocking legislation championed by the Democrats. He has also managed to get three Supreme Court Justices confirmed during his tenure, after blocking Barack Obama\u0027s attempt to get Merrick Garland confirmed in 2016.Some prominent Democrats have taken to Twitter to gloat about his possible impending departure from the Majority Leader\u0027s Office, including California Governor Gavin Newsom.The sun has not yet risen in Washington DC but a small army of Trump supporters has already descended on the US capital, Rozina Sabur writes.As reporters line up outside the White House grounds to receive their credentials for Donald Trump’s address later today, protesters have been streaming passed. Many have been hurling abuse, in a sign of how toxic US politics has become. “Why don’t you tell the truth?” shouts one. “You’re going to burn in hell,” says another. Washington is braced for unrest today with thousands of protests and counter- protests expected to mark Congress’ certification of the electoral college results.For the president’s supporters today marks an opportunity to express their frustration with the outcome of the election, and protests against what many believe was a fraudulent race. For Democrats, the event marks the final chapter in the Trump presidency. With the final nail being hammered in to the Donald Trump presidency today, our reporter Nick Allen takes a look at what is next for some of his closest advisers - his children.The Trump presidency has been a family affair and, as Donald Trump\u0027s star falls, his children find their futures looking uncertain too.Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have been White House employees, senior advisers to the president and, after he leaves office will be looking for new work.When Mr Trump assumed office, he left his adult sons, Donald Jr and Eric, running the Trump Organization. If he were to decide to resume control of his business they may be less busy too.It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Mr Trump\u0027s exit from the White House will lead to the start of a Trump political dynasty.READ MORE: What next for Donald Trump\u0027s children, after Joe Biden\u0027s inauguration?Reverend Raphael Warnock has become the first African-American to win a Senate seat in the history of Georgia after he defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler in a special run-off election on Tuesday night.The 51-year-old has never held political office before, but he has been an active member of Georgia’s political scene, spending much of the last decade campaigning for the expansion of Medicaid, criminal justice reform and increasing voter registration.Born the son of two Pentecostal pastors and raised in public housing in Savannah, Georgia, Rev Warnock has committed much of his life to his faith.READ MORE: Raphael Warnock: the African-American pastor who made history with Georgia Senate run-off winToday marks the day when Congress is expected to certify the Electoral College vote, officially recognising Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States.The clock is ticking. With or without the co-operation of the outgoing Trump administration during the transition, Joe Biden wants to hit the ground running when he takes office on January 20.Irrespective of the blizzard of litigation, Mr Biden has already identified key members of the team he hopes will help ensure that his administration assumes the reins of government smoothly.Elsewhere in America, Trump supporters have been gathering in Washington DC for a day of protests and rallies today.Protesters are gathering in anticipation of the certification of the electoral college results in Congress this afternoon. Once ratified, Joe Biden\u0027s victory as President will be officially confirmed.Overnight, MAGA supporters clashed with police in the nation\u0027s capital, as seen in footage on social media.President Trump has spent much of the last few days attempting to pressure his VP Mike Pence to stop Congress from ratifying the results.It is hard to over-exaggerate just how much is riding on the remaining Senate seat race in Georgia which will decide the balance of power and thus the fate of many of Joe Biden\u0027s policies, writes our US editor Ben Riley-SmithOn the current maths the Democrats have 49 seats and the Republicans have 50. Win the last so-called ‘run-off’ races in Georgia and the Democrats are just about over the line. In tied votes in the US Senate, the deciding vote is cast by the vice president, soon to be Kamala Harris. Mr Biden can pass some laws in that case without Republican votes.But if they fall short the Republicans keep their majority. And that means Mitch McConnell remains as Senate leader.READ MORE: How defeat in Senate battle could leave a hamstrung Joe Biden struggling to accomplish real changeAs the Democrats inch closer to control of the Senate, and a clean sweep politically, our reporter Nick Allen looks at what this could mean for the first 100 days of Joe Biden\u0027s presidency.President-elect Joe Biden is due to be sworn into office on January 20. Mr Biden made a long list of promises for his first 100 days, but his overriding priority will be the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, he is expected to try to roll the clock back as much as possible to January 2017, when he and Barack Obama left office.That would involve using executive orders, as much as possible, to overturn orders introduced by Mr Trump, including those that loosened environmental regulations.READ MORE: What will Joe Biden\u0027s first 100 days as US president look like, and when is his first day in office?In scenes reminiscent of the second week of November, all eyes are on the vote tabulaters in Georgia, who have just released their latest batch of counted ballots.It\u0027s good news for the Democrats, as Jon Ossoff now holds a lead of 16,370 votes, according to CNN, which means he is not only inching closer to victory, but inching closer to a win without a recount.With 98 per cent of ballots counted, Mr Ossoff has a lead of 0.4 per cent over Mr Perdue, taking him within striking distance of exceeding the 0.5 per cent recount threshold.However, as Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said earlier today, it is unlikely we will have a final tally until this afternoon.President Trump has spent the morning calling fraud in the run-off elections in Georgia, where Democrats have already won one race and are closing in on winning a second.Looks like they are setting up a big “voter dump” against the Republican candidates, the President tweeted. Waiting to see how many votes they need?Just happened to have found another 4000 ballots from Fulton County. Here we go! he tweeted a little later.Democrat Jon Ossoff has extended his lead over Republican David Perdue to 16,370 votes with 98 per cent of ballots counted, according to Edison Research.That gives Mr Ossoff a 0.4 per cent lead over Mr Perdue, taking him close to clearing the 0.5 per cent threshold under which Mr Perdue could automatically request a recount.Stacey Abrams, a former Representative in the Georgia House, has congratulated Rev Warnock on his Senate victory.Ms Abrams, who is seen as a key figure in the Democratic party, was credited with significantly increasing Democratic turnout in Georgia in the 2020 Presidential election.Further to our post at 8.23am, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has told CNN that some counties will now take a break from counting, and that we should have a better idea of the final results at noon on the East Coast, which is 5pm in London.“They’re probably going to take a break here, I think, in the next hour. Try and get as much work as they can done tonight ... At least, record exactly how many ballots are out there and then get as much scanning done tomorrow. Hopefully by noon we’ll have a better idea where we are,” he said.In the latest batch of counted votes, Democrat Jon Ossoff has extended his lead over Republican David Perdue to 12,806 votes. This gives him a lead of 0.2 per cent, which is still within the band where the loser in the race can request a recount. The winner must win by 0.5 per cent in order to avoid such a scenario.Donald Trump has taken to Twitter this morning to continue his attempts to pressure his VP Mike Pence to decertify results from some states, which would deny victory to Joe Biden.If Vice President  @Mike_Pence  comes through for us, we will win the Presidency, Trump tweeted.

Warnock, the senior pastor of the church where Martin Luther King preached through the height of the Civil Rights movement until his assassination, made history with a surge in African-American turnout.To be sure, a narrow win out of 4.4 million votes involves plenty of variables. But African-American voters were a force in the early vote and on Election Day. Notably, it wasn\u0027t just in metro Atlanta, but also in rural and small-town counties across South Georgia, where African-American turnout has historically lagged.That means it was an alliance ning from the most affluent African-American residents of Atlanta, including recent transplants to Georgia, to those African-American Georgia natives who hail from the most economically depressed pockets of the state.This election cycle a confluence of factors for African-American voters: 2020 offered the first general election after the disappointment of Stacey Abrams\u0027 narrowly missing out in 2018 on becoming the first African-American woman governor in U.S. history, and it was the first election after the death of Rep. John Lewis, Atlanta\u0027s civil rights icon who once marched alongside King and would publicly joust with Trump.Ms Loeffler and her Republican allies used the two-month runoff campaign to hammer Rev Warnock with ads calling him dangerous and radical. They used snippets of his sermons from Ebenezer Baptist Church to accuse him of hate speech and racial isiveness.But African-American voters can point to Tuesday\u0027s vote count and take credit for that strategy ending in defeat.The race for U.S. Senate in Georgia between incumbent GOP Sen. David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff is too early to call.As of 7:40 a.m. GMT Wednesday, Ossoff had a lead of 9,527 votes out of nearly 4.4 million counted, or a margin of less than 0.2 percentage points.There were still some mail ballots and in-person early votes left to be counted statewide, the majority of which are in Democratic-leaning counties.Under Georgia law, a trailing candidate may request a recount when the margin of an election is less than or equal to 0.5 percentage points.The Perdue-Ossoff race was one of two runoff elections that Georgia held Tuesday. In the other election, Democrat Raphael Warnock unseated Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler.The races will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Democrats must win both seats to take power, while Republicans only need one to keep Mitch McConnell as majority leader.The campaign for Republican David Perdue, who currently narrowly trails Democrat Jon Ossoff, has released a statement saying they believe Senator Perdue will be victorious.Using language that echoes that used by Donald Trump in the wake of his defeat to Joe Biden, the campaign said: We will mobilise every available resource and exhaust every legal recourse to ensure all legally cast ballots are properly counted.We believe in the end, Senator Perdue will be victorious.With 98 per cent of the vote counted, Sen. Perdue currently trails Mr Ossoff by 9,527 votes.Global stock prices slipped and bond yields rose on Wednesday as investors braced for the prospect that Democrats could win both seats at stake in a U.S. Senate run-off election in Georgia, handing them control of the chamber.Along with their narrow majority in the House of Representatives, a \u0027blue sweep\u0027 of Congress could usher in larger fiscal stimulus and pave the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push through greater corporate regulation and higher taxes.With Biden proposing to reverse President Donald Trump\u0027s tax cut, increase the minimum wage, and strengthen oversight on various industries, some might argue that his agenda is not particularly market-friendly, said Vasu Menon, investment strategy executive director at OCBC Bank in Singapore.Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff has taken a lead of about 3,500 votes in his close race against Republican US Senator David Perdue in Georgia, according to Edison Research.Both candidates have 50.0 per cent of the vote, but Ossoff has edged ahead of Perdue 2,195,441 to 2,191,881 with 98 per cent of the expected vote counted, according to Edison.The NBC television network on Wednesday projected Democrat Raphael Warnock the winner of his U.S. Senate runoff election against Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler.Warnock, a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta where slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King once preached, would become Georgia\u0027s first Black senator if final election results confirmed his victory.The close margins in the race means the winners might not be clear until at least Wednesday morning in the US.Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said election officials would take a break overnight but resume counting on Wednesday morning. Hopefully by noon we\u0027ll have a better idea where we are, he said on CNN.Most of the votes remaining to be counted were in counties Joe Biden won in November, with roughly 30,000 to go in DeKalb and Newton counties near Atlanta, according to Edison Research estimates.The critical races drew an estimated 4.5 million voters - a record for a run-off.Georgia Democrat Raphael Warnock claimed victory on Tuesday night in a key US Senate race against Republican Kelly Loeffler - who has not conceded defeat.US officials and major media had yet to declare a winner for either of the two Georgia seats at stake, both of which Joe Biden\u0027s Democrats need to flip to take control of the Senate.Georgia, I am honored by the faith that you have shown in me, Warnock, a 51-year-old Black pastor, said in a televised address shortly after midnight. And I promise you this tonight, I am going to the Senate to work for all of Georgia.Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock speaks on his campaign\u0026#39s Youtube accountAs the hour slipped past midnight on the East Coast, the odds of Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff beating Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue were slowing inching up. It was a seesaw night. Warnock and Ossoff jumped to early leads, but as more votes came in, the Republicans swung in front.It made for some great television suspense, although people following online saw a different view. The New York Times website estimated the victory probabilities in each race and, as the evening progressed, moved steadily in the Democrats\u0027 direction. After midnight, the Times judged both Warnock and Ossoff had a better than 95 per cent chance of winning.Even before 10 pm, Dave Wasserman of the influential Cook Political Report tweeted that he had seen enough to predict Warnock would beat Loeffler. That led Twitter, however, to slap his prediction with a warning that other sources were saying it was too close to call.The Republican election night party in Atlanta is beginning to empty, with those remaining increasingly concerned that one or both GOP Georgia Senate candidates could lose.That would give Georgia a Democratic senator for the first time since 2005, when Zell Miller retired from his seat.John Burke, a spokesperson for Republican David Perdue, says, This is going to be close. He says, We\u0027ll see how the last few votes go.Republican supporters attend a run-off election night party at Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead in AtlantaAs votes were tallied on Tuesday night, Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff had the backing of Black voters, younger voters, people earning less than $50,000 and newcomers to the state, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of voters in Tuesday\u0027s high-stakes Senate contests.The Republican coalition backing Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue was the mirror opposite: white, older, wealthier and longtime Georgia residents.The findings from AP VoteCast reveal the extent of Georgia\u0027s recent political transformation - from GOP bastion to electoral battleground where turnout is decisive. The survey found roughly 30 per cent of Georgia voters were Black and almost all of them - 94 per cent - backed Democrats. Voters under 45, those earning less than $50,000 and those who recently moved to Georgia all broke for Democrats.But Republicans held firmly onto their supporters, bringing out white voters and those older than 45 - groups that still account for majorities of Georgia voters. Republicans Perdue and Loeffler also fared better than their rivals among voters earning more than $75,000 and those who have called Georgia home for more than 20 years.A person dressed in a Spider-Man costume holds campaign signs for Senate candidates near a polling location in Marietta, GeorgiaDonald Trump has suggested that Georgian officials are waiting to see how many votes Democrats need to beat the Republicans before announcing results.In his latest unfounded claim of election fraud, Mr Trump appears to be saying that the vote is rigged against his party. But votes are being published in batches as they are counted, with delays due to counting a large number of postal votes.We\u0027ve all done it, haven\u0027t we? When the new year begins, it takes a few days to get used to writing the correct date.But most of us aren\u0027t writing statements for the the president of the United States.A post issued by the Trump campaign has provoked ridicule on Twitter after it contained a number of falsehoods – and the wrong date.In the statement, the president\u0027s team denied a New York Times report that Mike Pence will certify Joe Biden\u0027s victory. The statement claims, wrongly, that the vice-president can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification. He can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the House of Representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation. This is not true and there is no precedent for a US vice-president doing this.The statement was also incorrectly dated 2020.Washington police banned the leader of a far-right group from the city and made two arrests on Tuesday as protesters supporting President Trump\u0027s attempts to overturn the election gathered in the city.Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, who was arrested on Monday for destruction of property and possession of a firearm magazine, was released on Tuesday and ordered to stay away from the city, according to a court document.Protests against President-elect Joe Biden\u0027s November election win, which Congress will certify on Wednesday, started across the US capital on Tuesday and were expected to grow on Wednesday to thousands of people.Mr Trump, who lost the election by 7 million votes, was expected to speak to protesters on Wednesday morning at the Ellipse, a public park south of the White House, he said in a post on Twitter on Tuesday evening.Protesters are gathering in Washington DC before Wednesday\u0026#39s pro-Trump rallyA top Republican official in the Georgia secretary of state’s office has blamed Donald Trump for the Republican party\u0027s results so far, as early counts suggest they may be heading for defeat.Gabriel Sterling told CNN that if the Republican senators lose, the blame ought to fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his actions since November 3.Mr Sterling has criticised Mr Trump’s untrue claims of fraud in the November election. He told CNN that the president\u0027s claims undermined Republican voters\u0027 trust in voting.Mr Sterling also claimed that the president has started a civil war among Georgia Republicans by denying the results of the November election.Gabriel Sterling said Donald Trump had led Republicans to believe that their vote did not matterThe elections director for Georgia\u0027s most populous county said a bomb threat targeting an Election Day polling place was investigated last week by the FBI.Rick Barron of Fulton County said during a media briefing that the person said that the Nashville bombing was a practice run for what we would see today at one of our polling places.A bomb detonated in downtown Nashville on Christmas morning, killing the bomber and injuring three other people and damaging dozens of buildings.The Fulton County threat, received on December 30, was reported to the FBI. Mr Barron said agents visited the Tennessee home of the man who made the threat and searched it but did not make any arrests.Mr Barron also revealed that several members of his staff have received death threats and innumerable racial slurs have been directed at his staff, by phone and on social media.Republican former US president George W Bush will attend the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, his chief of staff has said.President and Mrs Bush look forward to returning to the Capitol for the swearing in of President Biden and Vice President Harris, Freddy Ford tweeted.Witnessing the peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy that never gets old, he added, in a seeming jab at President Trump who refuses to concede defeat and has not confirmed if he will attend Mr Biden\u0027s inauguration.It will be the eighth swearing-in ceremony the Bushs have attended, Mr Ford said.George Bush left office in 2009More people voted in Georgia\u0027s most populous county during Tuesday\u0027s run-off election than on Election Day in November.Fulton County elections director Rick Barron said there were more than 70,000 votes cast in person on Tuesday, with about 60,000 in-person votes on November 3. Fulton County includes most of Atlanta and is heavily Democratic.Mr Barron noted that there were fewer absentee ballots cast than during the general election and that the early in-person voting period was four days shorter, both of which he said may have contributed to the higher Election Day turnout.Spokesperson Summer Dunham says neighbouring DeKalb County, also a Democratic stronghold, also had more in-person votes on Tuesday than on November 3.Georgia voters in Tuesday\u0027s run-off races were evenly ided about which party should win, an exit poll showed.With about 10 per cent of the vote counted, Democrat Rev Raphael Warnock led Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler by 54.9pc to 45.1pc, while Jon Ossoff led Republican Senator David Perdue by 54.3pc to 45.7pc. However, those votes are from counties in Atlanta that are expected to vote Democrat.Edison Research\u0027s exit poll found roughly half of voters would prefer the Republican Party to retain control and half would like to see the Democrats take over, reflecting how close the two races were likely to be.The poll also found about half of voters in the two Senate run-off races voted for President Donald Trump in November\u0027s presidential election and half for Democrat Joe Biden.Meanwhile, about three quarters of voters who backed Republican candidates in Tuesday\u0027s votes said Joe Biden was not legitimately elected in November, according to AP VoteCast.Most polls have now closed in Georgia, though voters who were in line before 7pm (12am UK) will be allowed to vote.Results will begin to be posted in the next hour, though it may be some time before we have a definitive result.Officials have already started processing postal votes which should help to avoid a repeat of the scenes in November when Georgia\u0027s votes took days to count.Staff in Lawrenceville, Georgia, get cracking with the huge task of processing and counting all the votesGeorgia officials have started counting ballots as polls close across the state in two critical races.Here\u0027s what you need to know.What are these votes for?There are two Senate run-off elections being held. The votes are leftovers from the November general election, when none of the candidates hit the 50 per cent threshold.Why are they important?Democrats need to win both of the votes to seize the Senate majority – and, with it, control of the new Congress when Biden takes office in two weeks.Who are the candidates?In one contest, Republican Kelly Loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the Senate less than a year ago by the state\u0027s governor, faces Democrat Raphael Warnock, 51, who serves as the senior pastor of the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached.The other election pits 71-year-old former business executive David Perdue, a Republican who held his Senate seat until his term expired on Sunday, against Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist.

Italy occupied the country from 1935-41, when it became part of the Italian East Africa colony.La Molisana, based in the Molise region of southern Italy, said that it would change the name of the pasta to “conchiglie” – Italian for shells, in reference to the shape of the product.The firm’s apology was welcomed by the National Association of Partisans, which represents the guerrilla fighters who battled Italian Fascist and German forces during the Second World War.Michele Petraroia, the head of the association in Molise, said the pasta company had a proud tradition of standing up to fascism, recalling that its factory had been destroyed by retreating Axis forces during the war.“Nevertheless, it was appropriate that La Molisana should clarify that it has nothing to do with fascism.”Italy underwent less of a reckoning with its dark past than Germany and there is still a vocal minority of Italians who openly praise the fascist era.There was controversy last May, during the first wave of the pandemic, when a company in Verona in northern Italy produced face masks adorned with the image of Mussolini.The face masks were condemned as “deplorable” by MPs from the centre-Left Democratic Party, part of the ruling coalition.Modern day fascists are regularly drawn to Predappio, the town in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna where Il Duce is buried.A handful of shops in the town do a brisk trade in fascist memorabilia, including busts and keyrings, statues of Mussolini on a rearing stallion, pasta in the shape of his helmeted head and even Mussolini-themed babies’ bibs.Neo-fascists gather in the town three times a year – on the anniversaries of Mussolini’s birth, death, and his March on Rome, the 1922 putsch which brought him to power.Reminders of the fascist era are never far away in Italy - in Rome there is a towering stone obelisk that still bears the words “Mussolini Dux”, Latin for Duce or Leader.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"report schools ofsted children not given enough work lockdown","story":"Parents should report schools to Ofsted if their children do not get enough work during the latest lockdown, the Education Secretary has said.Gavin Williamson said parents whose children are not receiving good quality remote education should complain to the schools watchdog, which will investigate if it believes there is cause for concern. He told the Commons schoolchildren should receive between three and five hours of teaching a day, depending on their age.If parents feel their child\u0027s school is not providing suitable remote education, they should first raise their concerns with the teacher or headteacher and, failing that, report the matter to Ofsted, he said.Ofsted will inspect schools – of any grade – where it has serious concerns about the quality of remote education being provided.Mr Williamson\u0027s statement came after Boris Johnson announced on Monday night that schools will remain closed to all but the children of key workers and the most vulnerable youngsters until the February half-term at the earliest.The Education Secretary said the Government had laid out clear, legally binding requirements for schools to provide high-quality remote education during the third lockdown, adding that this is mandatory for all state schools and will be enforced by Ofsted.He also used his statement to confirm that all GCSEs and A-levels will be cancelled and teachers\u0027 predicted grades will be used instead.Mr Williamson told MPs that the Department for Education had learned from last year, when a controversial algorithm was initially used to calculate grades but ditched following a major public outcry. Students were then awarded the grades their teachers had predicted, which led to massive grade inflation.Mr Willialsom said: I can confirm that GCSEs and A and AS Level exams will not go ahead this summer. This year, we are going to put our trust in teachers rather than algorithms. He said teachers would be given training and support to ensure that their predicted grades are awarded fairly and consistently.But his remarks prompted a backlash among headteachers, who said it was nothing short of disgraceful that ministers are threatening schools over the quality of their remote learning offering.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, said: Schools were told at 8pm on Monday night that they would switch to remote learning by 9am the next day and to organise provision for vulnerable and key worker pupils.They have spent the last 48 hours working tirelessly to put plans in place, despite the fact that on Sunday the PM was saying that schools would remain open.

The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being fine tuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and very rarely, the entire school, could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"children without laptops who cant","story":"NewsChildren without laptops or who cant work at home can go into school, minister confirmsGavin Williamson confirmed that those children without the space to work or the technology needed can continue to go into schoolmirrorShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsOver a million children are estimated to not have the necessary access to learn from home \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Quizzed about the potential impact of school closures on the estimated . million children without access to the internet,  Gavin Williamson confirmed that just like in Marchaposs lockdown those who cannot access classes from home can attend school. Schools remain open throughout the lockdown for vulnerable children and the children of key workers. Conservative chair of the Education Committee Robert Halfon raised concerns about the “digital ide”. He said: “I strongly welcome the Government’s laptop scheme but we know that there still will be, possibly, hundreds of thousands of people on the wrong side of the digital ide. “Can he confirm that those students who just don’t have internet connection or computers at home will be able to go to school alongside children of critical workers  Referring to last year’s lockdown, Mr Williamson replied: “Children who didn’t have access to digital devices were able to access education in that school and that is the same standard and same guidance that we are issuing today as well. “We’ll be doing everything that we can do to ensure that children are not left behind.” Technology firms have pledged to work with the Government to ensure schoolchildren are able to adequately study remotely after coming under pressure to improve access to data and devices during England’s latest lockdown. The Government has said that more than one million laptops and tablets will be provided to pupils by the end of the academic year to help with remote study, and previously launched a scheme to provide subsidised mobile data to those who need it. But as schools close to most pupils under the latest lockdown restrictions announced on Monday, fresh concerns have been raised about a digital ide among pupils, with many unable to access or afford mobile devices or an adequate broadband connection, and technology firms being urged to do more to make data and devices available to those unable to afford to take part in remote learning.

But since last March I have looked after wards where all the patients have Covid- for months on end. Iaposve never seen anything like it. Total UK Covid deaths hit , this week but many more infected people end up in hospital, get sick in care homes or have a rough few weeks at home. On call for emergency admissions, as I was this week, around half the patients I admit are sick due to Covid. Right now, a quarter of our beds are filled by Covid patients and our Intensive Care Units and High Dependency Units, have nearly doubled in size to cope with the surge in demand. The current peak is already as high as it was in April and the models suggest it will worsen through January. I have never seen so many patients needing so much oxygen for so long and while I’m very used to looking after seriously ill and dying patients, the sheer number has been relentless. One morning in April I saw five die within around  minutes. Hearing some people say it is “just a cold” or “just like a normal flu season” beggars belief for NHS staff dealing with this disease every day. Every second patient I saw yesterday on call, or on my ward this morning, had severe breathlessness from Covid-pneumonia that would take days to get over. Many of the others are confused or weak or dehydrated or have serious stomach upsets. Some deteriorate very rapidly and need additional help to breathe. For others, sadly, especially the older and frail or those with underlying lung and heart conditions or cancer it can be the last straw. With visiting and travel restrictions in place, doctors and nurses who’d prefer to speak with scared and upset patients’ relatives in person, and let them be with their loved one, spend a lot of time on distressing bad news phone calls. NHS friends and colleagues have died from Covid caught at work, or lost their own parents to it. While others have been advised to stay at home, we come into work surrounded by risk of infection. Many other NHS clinical staff have been hospitalised or are still suffering the effects of “long Covid”. Others are off sick or self-isolating – putting further pressure on the ones still at work. Some people arenapost happy about the lockdowns, the school closures, the behavioural restrictions and the mask wearing. I understand that. We’re all sick of it. We should take concerns about jobs, the economy and the impacts on health seriously. But some take this further by trying to tell us that the pressures on the NHS or the death rates are exaggerated. Walk a mile in the shoes of acute hospital staff, see what we see, look at the data and at least some of them would change their minds. One view doing the rounds from people who think we’ve gone too far in our Covid measures is that the virus only kills the old or the sick. So we just protect them better and “let the rest of us get on with our lives”.  You’ll see people arguing that less than  people under  with no existing medical conditions have been killed. Dig a bit deeper and you’ll see how daft this argument is. For starters, there are  million people over  in the UK, including . million over . That could be you, your parents, friends or family. Many are still very active and make a huge contribution as parents, grandparents, volunteers, employees and unpaid carers. Even the most frail are humans with human rights. Should we just write them off  Second, those people with “pre-existing conditions” - including those in their s, s and s - are not all people who would have died anyway. Covid takes years off their le expectancy. Those conditions arenapost just dementia or terminal cancer, but include diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma heart and kidney disease that people live and often work with for many years. Millions of people live with such conditions. Should we send them all to the Covid- knackers yard  Are they not worth bothering with "},{"url":null,"title":"kids poverty facing third lockdown","story":"NewsKids in poverty facing third lockdown without laptops - how you can helpMany children in England still lack the technology they need to learn online despite being forced out of classrooms and back home by a third coronavirus lockdownmirrorShareCommentsByLucy ThorntonPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsHome broadband is more important than ever with schools closed \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Parents have been going without food to pay for internet use, fearing their child is falling behind, a school boss has revealed. Charities, head teachers and councils are asking the Government to give more help. Internet providers are being urged to waive fees and data caps for disadvantaged families. Linda Heiden, boss of voluntary group Lambeth TechAid in South London, said the Government’s provision of laptops is “a joke”.  She called the problems a “national scandal” and described the demand for laptops and wi-fi access as “overwhelming”. Ms Heiden said: “I’m outraged the Government hasn’t done more. We’ve had a whole year, it’s been obvious this is coming. Their promises have amounted to nothing. “We are letting this whole generation down. Parents and children are despairing. They are stuck at home without access.” The Department for Education insists schools are “well prepared to deliver remote education”, with , laptops and tablets given to schools last year and a further , this week. Greenwood Academies Trust, with  schools in the Midlands and the east of England, received laptops from the Government, but chief executive Wayne Norrie said they need more help as a third of their , pupils are without laptops. He added: “Many parents don’t have broadband contracts. They are on zero-hours contracts and don’t have good enough credit. “A lot of our children are in small houses with multiple children and there isn’t the space to work. Our families are getting poorer and the stress and the pressure our families are under is increasing. Some of our parents have gone without food to help their children.  “One of the parents had to decideshe was going to eat or get some data to help her children. “We stepped in once we realised what was happening.” Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at Action For Children, said the third national lockdown “risks causing irreparable damage to the le chances” of hundreds of thousands of children. He added: “The added costs of home learning, including laptops and internet access, were one of the main reasons families needed crisis grants from us last year.” Ofcom figures suggest between . million and . million children in the UKdo not have home access to a laptop, desktop or tablet. On Tuesday there was growing pressure on tech firms to provide more free data for disadvantaged kids.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “Data is a big problem. “Everybody needs to try and make this work, and that includes the companies that can take away the charging for data.” He later praised mobile network Three after it announced it will give free unlimited data to disadvantaged kids in England.BT works with the DfE on a scheme that provides poor children with extra mobile data each month. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the PM should push network operators to make data more affordable. The BBC has ann­ou­n­ced it will provide the “biggest education offer in its history”. From Monday, CBBC will provide three hours of primary school programming, while BBC will support GCSE pupils through at least two hours of programming each weekday.

Thataposs because itaposs a rather chilling place, by all accounts. Opposite Queenborough in Sheppey is an area dubbed Deadmanaposs Island, where no visitors are permitted.The island is covered in human remains and coffins, with bones and skulls all over the place. Why, you ask  Well, more than  years ago, the spot was used as a burial ground for convicts who died aboard prisoner ships, reports Kent Live. As water levels have changed over time, the bodies in the unmarked graves have been uncovered. In , due to coastal erosion and a sht in tides, skulls and bone fragments now stick out of the ground from the six feet of mud that once blanketed the area. The island, which was once lost under the high seas, was most recently explored in  by the BBCaposs Inside Out South East programme. The crew are among some of the only visitors to have set foot on the island in recent times as people are banned due to its bird breeding and nesting site. Owned by Natural England, the land is out of bounds to the public as a Site of Special Scientic Interest and is recognised to be of international importance under the Ramsar convention. Natalie Graham, who presented the Inside Out programme claims sheaposll never be able to forget the terrying sights she saw on Deadmanaposs Island. Speaking to The Sun, she said: What I saw there will stay with me forever. This is a really strange sight. I would imagine there can’t be anywhere on earth like this. Th showaposs director, Sam Supple added: It is like being on the set of a horror film. It looks so surreal, it’s like an art department has designed it. There are open coffins and bones everywhere.

Right at the beginning of  the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their plans to step back as senior royals. They said they would become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. In the following year, Harry, Meghan and baby Archie found themselves a home in Calornia and have remained in the US throughout the pandemic. At the end of December they debuted their podcast Archewell Audio, which they made as part of a reported £million deal with Spoty. While the royal coupleaposs plans to stand on their own two feet appear to be going well, an emotional as well as physical gap remains between them and the rest of the Firm.

Boss of Chandler Court, Dawn Covill, said: “We all miss going to the pub. “In these challenging times, there’s nothing like catching up with an old friend over a drink or two. “So when residents told us they missed their local, we thought we’d bring it to them.” The care home was able to set up a pub within their building. This meant that it was allowed to stay open and residents could visit it in a safe, socially distanced manner.  “For many residents, the pub is associated with a lot of positive memories from their younger years, from their first-ever drink to countless hearty meals with family or friends, and everything in between.” He added. “The Chandler Arms’ opening was a huge success and residents left with a smile on their face. “Ironically, it turns out we’re the only pub in the UK to be unaffected by the tier restrictions, so we’re looking forward to our next pub night.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pimlico pusher shoulder barged pensioner","story":"News‘Pimlico Pusher shoulder barged pensioner toward oncoming bus after Tesco rowAmelia Doris, , fled the scene with two children as the victim, Linda Lancaster, only just avoided being hit by the bus in posh Pimlico, central LondonmirrorShareCommentsByTony Palmer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video pimlico-pusher-shoves-woman-moving-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Ian Green, the Chief Executive of leading HIV and sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, spoke to The Mirror last month about the continued impact of the late Princess Diana’s work in fighting HIV AIDS through her son Prince Harry.Green said: “I was privileged to meet the Princess a couple of times, not in relation to Terrence Higgins Trust, but other charities. And what I noticed about her was how genuine she was, how that she would pin people in authority to making commitments but in a really disarming way. And I certainly see that within Prince Harry as well.” The Terrence Higgins Chief Executive also spoke about the importance of Prince Harry’s own actions in tackling testing for HIV. He revealed: “I mean, heaposs indicated, when I first met him about three, three or four years ago now, that HIV was one of his real passions, and one of the main causes he was going to focus on, and he certainly kept his promise. And when he took an HIV test, publicly, there was a % increase in orders for HIV self-testing kits, on our websites. And he said very publicly, that everybody should know their status. “Becausesomebody is HIV positive and gets on treatment, their outcomes are good now. So I think heaposs done a huge amount to encourage people to get tested, but also continue to chip away at the stigma as his mother did. So I think thereaposs there are these huge similarities between the two of them.”Despite stepping down as a senior member of the Royal Family alongside his we Meghan, Duchess of Sussex earlier this year, Green says that the Duke of Sussex remains focused on issues surrounding HIV AIDS.“He remains passionate and committed to HIV as a cause,” noted Green. “Along with our colleagues at Elton John AIDS Foundation and the National AIDS Trust, we published the HIV commission report a couple of weeks ago, more day to day, setting out what needs to be done to end new HIV transmissions in the country by , and the Prince publicly endorsed it and made a public statement. “So heaposs still active. Heaposs still there. I know that we can still turn to himwe need his support and his help.” "},{"url":null,"title":"top 10 most popular european","story":"NewsTop  most popular European baby names for boys and girls predicted for Research has revealed the most commonly used European baby names around the world - but many of the most popular names among parents in the UK missed out on the listmirrorShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JAN NewsThe majority of parents questioned said they would be picking a traditional name \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In the January  edition of the Essentials magazine covering Gresford, Marford and Rossett, Cllr Atkinson wrote: This is causing a lot of problems and making night times unbearable for a number of residents. Iaposm in touch with council officers, trying to get this sorted out and to get the factory in question to recty the issue ASAP. Now that itaposs been identied where its coming from I am shocked itaposs not sorted yet given the documented problems that itaposs causing and Iaposm asking for the pressure to be increased on this to sort it ASAP.  WCBCaposs public protection service manager, Ian Jones, said: “We did issue a notice to the company following complaints from residents in the area. We are pleased that since that time no further complaints have been received. We understand that the company is awaiting a new part for one of their machines which should ensure there is not a repeat of the noise experienced. Residents and the local councillor have expressed their thanks for the speedy resolution to this matter.” However, this isn’t the first time that the mystery humming has caused a headache for locals.

Chuck Stacey, who owns an IT firm, struggles to breathe as he delivers his stark message in a harrowing video that he recorded while being treated for Covid- - a disease he had dismissed as a bad flu. Seriously ill with the virus and now filled with regret, the American man, who has an oxygen tube up his nose, tells the camera: “I didn’t wear a mask. I should’ve. I didn’t. “I believed this was just the flu and it was all going to go away and it was political. I didn’t think a mask would help.” Click here for our live blog with the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions in the UK. As he struggles to breathe, Chuck, from Inlet Beach, Florida, adds: “You don’t want to end up like me. I’m having trouble breathing. I may have to be intubatedI get any worse.” He didnapost take the virus or face masks seriously even though the US has the worst outbreak in the world, with , deaths and . million confirmed cases. He even attacked workers at a local Donut Hole shop for wearing face masks to protect themselves and customers from the disease.In May, Chuck wrote on Facebook: “I have to say I have had it with the masks that the employees are being forced to wear. “It’s just another example of the continued overreaction to this situation. Please stop so when we come to eat we can enjoy our meal without feeling sorry for the employees.” This week, in the video recorded from his hospital bed, Chuck urged skeptics to change their beliefs and do what is necessary to protect themselves and others. He says: “If wearing a mask can reduce your chances of getting this even by five per cent, just wear a mask. “Do it for your children, your loved ones. Do it for yourself.”Chuckaposs friend, Daniel Uhlfelder, shared the video on Twitter.Referring to US President Donald Trump, who has consistently downplayed the virus and peddled misinformation, Daniel wrote: “My friend didn’t wear a mask because he believed the lies from our leaders. Now, he’s close to being intubated. He asked that I share this.”Chuck shared additional videos in which he said he wore a face shield instead of a face mask at the advice of his doctor because of his “claustrophobia,” which he described as “debilitating”.  He explained: “My doctor came up with the idea of a face shield with social distancing and being responsible with hand sanitiser and [minimising] my contact in the field. I own an IT company so I can work from home. It’s worked for almost a year. “Nothing is  per cent on this virus and evenI would’ve wore a mask I could’ve still gotten it. But the fact of the matter is we have to do everything that we can do to protect ourselves and to protect the people that are really at risk.

Zack King from Hackney, east London, ed home one day to find his one-year-old feline Billy with an unexpected note attached to his collar informing him that heaposd been paying their neighbour frequent visits. His girlfriend, -year-old Olga Shipunova, replied to the sweet surprise back in September and theyaposve since become pen-pals - an unexpected relationship that Zach, , says has been a highlight of the coronavirus lockdown. Thanks to their apospostcatapos Billy, the neighbours have managed to exchange around  handwritten notes.Theyaposve been able to share recipes and television recommendations with their unknown neighbour who even kitted little Billy out with a proper mailbag. Zack, who works in advertising, said: It was really sweet when it happened - we had a note saying aposyour cat always comes and sees meapos - we know that heaposs a friendly cat. Olga replied and itaposs been back and forth a little bit - itaposs really her replying and we add a few nice recommendations and stuff.  Iaposd saved them all and shared them with family and friends because theyaposre animal lovers and it just occurred to me that I should probably put it online. My favourite note was when she asked what she could treat him with - she was kind enough to say he could have salmon, and we let her know that he loves everything. Zack said that the relationship is still ongoing and the latest note has been attached to Billy for the last  hours - but they have no idea when their British Shorthair will be paying their pen pals his next visit. Zack shared the story on Twitter which quickly amassed more than , likes and retweets.He said: I thought a few people might get something out of it - it was nice to see that people shared it. Itaposs definitely something we look forward to - when the cat flap goes and we suddenly notice that the note isnapost what weaposve attached and thereaposs a new note.  Billy is very cheeky and inquisitive - he doesnapost do things by half -heaposs sleepy heaposs sleepy andheaposs playful heaposs playful. Billy himself has been a highlight of lockdown - and the notes, extra so - especially as the winter months drew in and we found it a bit tougher with fewer connections. The first note the couple received read: Your cat likes to come visit us when he is outside.  He will sit at the door and meow to be let in. Itaposs actually hilarious and we love him!! We have no idea where he is coming from. Whataposs his name  We call him Billy : From your friendly neighbours! Olga and Zack replied: Weaposre glad heaposs making friends with the neighbours! And his name is Billy!!! So you guessed right.  Give him lots of chin scratches! We lost his name tag, we need to get him a new one xx The pair regularly exchanged notes, with the delighted neighbour describing Billy delivering their notes like a carrier pigeon, but much cuter obvs. What started off as general chit-chat turned into recipe sharing, including instructions on how to whip up a batch of wasabi mash, and how to make the most incredible hummus.

The doormat features the two Disney icons facing each other with a red heart between them.

She zoomed in on the mouseaposs flouncy skirt to explain what she meant. The video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times since being shared three days ago, with viewers flooding the comment section with laughing emojis.

The good news is you can now relive those glory days with an online version - and itaposs absolutely free. Itaposs simple to do, with one person needing to visit playingcards.io and click aposcreate roomapos to set up the virtual game. It then provides a code which can be shared with anyone you want to join, who can see every move in real-time.

The secretive state adopted the new measures in December, fearing that its teenage citizens were growing too comfortable with words popular in neighbouring South Korea. Now the authorities will reportedly inspect citizens’ phones, hunting for any use of banned expressions in private messages. Those caught will be suspected of flouting the ban on South Korean TV and could face the gulag. Talking to Rimjingang, a Japan-based magazine focused on the dictatorship, one North Korean parent revealed the sort of harmless slang that could land kids in hot water. The parent said: “The target of the crackdown is the text messages on cell phones. “It has been a while since South Korean dramas first came to North Korea, right “Since cell phones have become common recently, young people are using South Korean phrases in their text messages. “For example, almost all young people are using ‘saranghaeyeong’ , ‘chal-ka’ , ‘bye-bye,’ and ‘ty’in their texts. “If there are any expressions in the text messages that are not used in North Korea, the owner of the device will be suspected of watching South Korean dramas and interrogated. “Inspectors also check the text messages for any rumours or complaints about dficulties due to the Covid- pandemic. “However, students and young people are clever, so they are very careful to delete their text messages as soon as possible after sending them.” A three-page document marked apostop secretapos, obtained by Rimjingang, sheds more light on the ban. In the document, Kim Jong-un reportedly brands South Korea a apospuppetapos of the USA and names more banned words. He says: “We must strongly eradicate the [South Korean] ‘puppet words’ and ‘puppet style’ from our society. In the past, I have repeatedly warned against the phenomenon of young men and women who are not blood relatives using the ‘puppet’s language’ to refer to each other. “Such as ‘oppa’and ‘dong-saeng’ . “However, this phenomenon has not yet disappeared among some young people. “This is a typical example of the perverted ‘puppet language’ and ‘puppet style’ that is widespread in our society.” Greg Scarlatoiu, director of the Washington DC-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, said the Kim regime clearly felt threatened by South Korea’s growing apossoft power.apos "},{"url":null,"title":"woman tells boy 9 go","story":"NewsWoman tells boy, , go back to your country in vile racist rant on busVideo shows the woman telling the Ireland-born boy - whose mum is from Brazil - \"youre not Irish\" until the Dublin Bus driver driver kicks her off and forces her to continue her journey on footmirrorShareCommentsByDarragh BerryMark Corcoran:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video racist-woman-bus-shouts-go-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Video shows the unruly woman verbally abusing the boy and his mother, originally from Brazil, on board a bus in Dublin until she was kicked off by a hero driver. At one point, the woman tells the Ireland-born youngster, who was wearing a green jacket and hat, youaposre not Irish. The woman, who wasnapost wearing a face mask despite coronavirus rules, and another passenger were told to leave the bus and continue the rest of their journey on foot. The mum, who has been living in Ireland for  years and asked to remain anonymous, told DublinLive that her son asked her after the incident: They told me to take the green off me, am I not Irish  He was reading something aloud about coronavirus when the woman launched her tirade on Monday afternoon. She said it was a stressful and horrible start to their new year, and itaposs not the first time she has been verbally abused due to her background. She said: I was with my son. We got on the bus. He had a loud tone of voice, he was a reading an advert on the bus about coronavirus. There were not many people on the bus, so everybody could hear what he was reading.  The woman wearing a mask who was sitting on the second last seat on the row, started looking back and saying aposwhat are you saying about coronavirus apos. And when they are looking back, they are looking at my son, they are focusing all their attention on him and directing all the speech at my son who is only a child, he is only nine. The woman continued to ask the same question as the situation escalated. The boyaposs mum said: She was saying aposthis is a serious issue, people are dying around the world and youaposre making a joke about itapos - but he wasnapost making a joke, he was reading facts on the advert. Then the woman at the very end of the row, who wasnapost wearing a mask, started saying aposgo back to your home country, take the green off your clothesapos because my son was wearing a green jacket and hat. aposYouaposre not Irish, youaposre not Irishapos she kept saying, aposgo back to your home countryapos. But at the next bus stop, the bus driver stopped and opened the door and went over to the pair as you can see in the video and just said aposoff the bus, off the busapos and demanded that they leave. I remained quiet the whole time because I was scared thatI reacted things would have escalated. The mum feared her son would be traumatised. She has felt angry and sad following the incident. She added: But my son was born here, Ireland is our home. He kept saying, aposbut she asked me to take the green off saying that I wasnapost Irish, that was not niceapos.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is, in addition, to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.How can I report a rule breach You can report a breach taking part in Scotland by accessing the form here.The form is for reporting breaches and isnot meant for reporting emergencieswith the police still advising members of the publicto call  in an emergency.Recent Covid- hotspots:"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-new-lockdown-rules-borders","story":"THE Borders is going back into a full-scale lockdown for at least four weeks.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced todaythat mainland Scotland will see strict coronavirus rulesenforced from midnight until at least February .These rules will be even tighter than the Level  measures which forced the closure of pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops.During her statement, Ms Sturgeon outlined what the new restrictions will mean for mainland Scotland.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They race out of their cars to help people load shopping into the boot, or help elderly people into the car, and often carry the heavy bags to customers# homes.Taxi drivers are a leline for elderly people all across the country and I hope ours know that we notice all the little things they do to go the extra mile.Name and address supplied.The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will, for the first time, intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory Government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

Many people will have been blessed by her words over the years. Our thanks go to her at this time.We are all pleased to see the end of . A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online.

We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

On the left, it has been accused of propping up the establishment, turning us into ldquogiggling couch potatoes unwilling to think too hard. Indeed, it is claimed the show unwittingly helped Boris Johnson become Prime Minister, with his several appearances allowing him to finesse his shambling posh-boy persona.In contrast, on the right, Hyslop, in particular, is often the target of much venom, whose occasional scathing diatribes have been described as humourless ldquostandard-issue BBC socialism.:Do they know the Christmas song is dead However, I find it reassuring that neither side of the fence can claim ownership of the show.

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash.

But I just never felt that! This book was dficult to make ndash it caused me a lot of sorrow. It was a trap for all my emotions. Sometimes, we make things without knowing what is motivating us exactly because we have to. I hope maybe Irsquoll feel the benefit of having done this in a few years.What comes across very strongly is your mumrsquos strength and stoicism in the face of everything.In this book I tried to create a fair, non-idealised, non-romanticised portrait of my mother.

She came from a family where you werenrsquot supposed to show \"weakness.\"Does  feel very far away today It doesnrsquot feel as far away as all that. The pandemic definitely brought me back to those years where I struggled so much with solitude, but things arenrsquot as hard for me these days. Irsquom not totally healed, but Irsquom definitely not as sad as I was, even though my father also passed away not so very long ago. Itrsquos the cycle of bereavement that continues. They say time heals all wounds but maybe for me it just takes longer than other people.I love the physical world you locate your character in on the page. Itrsquos both realistic and yet sweetly cartoony. It is also intricate, ie, it looks like a lot of work. Is there a pleasure in creating that detail, or is it a pain in the backside.I have a soft spot when it comes to drawing Montreal and its environs. I take a lot of pleasure in acting as a tour guide of sorts, in describing my country, its particularities, its sometimes horrible architecture, its inhabitants. All of that is really fun to draw, but it takes a toll on my neck and hand.Paul is obsessed by fonts. Are you too  When did your own interest in them begin Itrsquos an interest Irsquove had forever. My father was a typographer, and I was very interested in him, and by extension in his career. When I was  years old I studied typography myself, but already by that timethe profession was disappearing. So, I turned to graphic design, thinking in part that that was a profession where I could still sometimes absorb myself in the world of typography.In a year in which we have all been isolated, how have you found being alone  Is a pandemic good for cartooning The pandemic is too unsettling and destabilising for me to be able to make comics. I am ready for the winds of change to blow this unpleasant atmosphere away. I want to rediscover my choir, museums, theatre, art exhibits. After all, art nourishes art.What do you love about comic strips I love working alone. And I love the fact that, with pencil and paper alone, you can create and control a universe as complex as any found in feature- film.Whatrsquos your history with them My father bought me my first Tintin when I was six years old. I never lost my passion for comics from that day onward. Itrsquos a major art form that people are just beginning to appreciate. Therersquos nothing  like comics. A comic is completely dferent from a novel or a static illustration or even an animated drawing. Itrsquos all of those things at once.

Many will often view Scotland as nicely wrapped within a lovely box, tied with a charming tartan bow. Of course, such a positive view is not harmful, in fact, it can be beneficial.What is lacking in America is a depth of understanding about Scotland as an innovative, entrepreneurial, and progressive nation. The Biden Administration is listening and seems to understand the gt Scotland offers the world is so much more profound than to simply view it and the Scottish people as merely delightful.First Minister Sturgeon, numerous Scottish ministers and MPs representing Scotland have made important connections with U.S. leaders over the years and reinforced this message.One excellent connection the FM Sturgeon made was with then Deputy Secretary of State Blinken. It is valuable that Scotland and the United States have an existing relationship between the FM and the future Secretary of State on which to build.The U.S. Government would be wise to expand its presence in Scotland for strategic and economic reasons. Currently, the U.S. has one Foreign Service Officer based in Edinburgh who serves effectively in the U.S. Consulate as Principal Officer.A new U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. should make a tactical stroke to relocate a handful of commercial, political, and economic officer positions from London to cover regions across Scotland. Doing so will signicantly enrich the ambassadorrsquos knowledge as an advisor to President Biden and Secretary Blinken.The ambassador would better comprehend the political and economic dynamics in the U.K. and Europe, position the U.S. for the COP in Glasgow, improve the grasp of understanding of the U.S. Scottish trading relationship, and aid in forging more partnerships between U.S. and Scottish entities across sectors.Further, with a wider tactical presence, U.S. leaders will see how Scotland is leveraging sectors and offering a policy blueprint for other nations, businesses, and communities when it comes to hydrogen and net-zero policy, tech innovation, inclusion, wind-power, healthcare, human rights, le sciences, and caring for vulnerable populations.While these are dficult budget times in Scotland with an historic need to prioritize caring for those impacted by the pandemic, a fundamental international question is on the table. Should Scotland commit more resources to widen strategic relationships throughout the United States  The Scottish Office within the British Embassy in Washington, DC continues to do outstanding work. I am always amazed by how much they shoulder, lt, and achieve.Also, the broader teams in the British Embassy and British Consulates around the U.S. are an effective voice for all nations comprising the United Kingdom. Scottish interests in the U.S. are also aided by a wider community of Scottish groups, societies, organisations and advocates including Scottish Development International, Scottish Business Network, the GlobalScot network, ScotWeek, Entrepreneurial Scotland, among many other actors.Clearly this capacity is having a positive effect, but a greater potential impact is being left unrealized. Scotland must find a way to build on a strong existing foundation and invest more into scaling up in the U.S. Doing so will secure tangible benefits for Scottish enterprise, culture, trade, tourism, research, and academia at a key moment.A fresh foreign policy vision by President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the incoming team for Europe and beyond offers an opportunity for the United States and Scotland to forge modern links. Scotland can build on its own lsquospecial relationshiprsquo with the United States by launching a more assertive, strategic, and creative plan backed with more capacity building resources. And as the United States develops a renewed global approach, it can enlarge its footprint in Scotland while fully respecting and expanding its key connection with the U.K. A deeper partnership between Scotland and the U.S. is not only mutually beneficial, but valuable for the U.K., Europe, and the larger global community.Ian Houston has spent his career in Washington, DC as an international non-profit leader, a policy advocate for diplomatic engagement and global poverty alleviation, and intercultural dialogue.

This is not the work of crusty French bread or a rogue brazil nut, but a soft-centred chocolate which, when bitten into, put up a fight. In size, this hand-made cherry brandy fondant, decorated in pink icing, was less a piece of confectionary and more a magicianrsquos top hat. Its neighbours were half its girth, whereas the lid bulged over this beauty. It was absolutely delicious but next time ndash and there will be a next time ndash Irsquoll use cutlery.Irsquove been eating a lot of chocolates lately. Turkey, stuffing, and panetone too, and a surfeit of other festive fare. In my defence, these caloric treats are balanced with seasonal side dishes of brussels sprouts, carrots and kale. Irsquove had a fondness for brussels sprouts since we had to boil a saucepan of them in my first domestic science class. It was the only lesson in this subject where I excelled. Back then, I seasoned with pepper.Today, a drizzle of olive oil turns them into the food of the gods. Thus, as I reach for a mid-morning biscuit, eyeing up the snow clouds outside and thinking of the energy required to get me through to lunch, I refuse to feel guilty. Others, however, seem hell-bent on pricking the nationrsquos conscience and turning an innocent cooked breakfast or buttered scone into a source of shame.There are many reasons to dread the start of the new year, not least the dark and cold. One unfailing, ill-timed and unnecessary scourge is the avalanche of advice doled out around January  by nutritionists and dieticians. Even worse than the tips of health professionals is the enthusiasm of former junk food addicts who, after a Damascene conversion that usually involves a near-death experience, are messianic about their new habits.My idea of weight control is whether or not I can tuck a T-shirt into my jeans after theyrsquove been in a -degree wash. The battery on my bathroom scales died years ago, since when theyrsquove been gathering dust under the bed. This is not something to boast about , but while I can face up to many things in le ndash a leaking roof, mice under the eaves, a looming taxdeadline ndash knowing how many kilos Irsquove gained is not one of them.There seems something sadistic about exhorting people to give up comfort food at precisely the time of year it was designed for. It might be fine to start January with a health kickyou live in Alice Springs or Calornia. In Achiltibuie or Crail, however, it feels cruel. When sleet is whistling around the windows, and the streets are coated in ice, the idea of following a meagre, challenging or carefully calibrated diet does not appeal.All of us know, by now, that Covid does not just love a crowd, it is also drawn to love handles. Being clinically obese is thought to raise the risk of coronavirus complications. The unfailing appearance of New Year diets, however, seems more a lestyle adjunct than a serious medical intervention. They fall into the same category as making resolutions to give up fags or booze, or to pound the pavement, clocking up steps like a hamster on a wheel. This year, however, therersquos not even the incentive of needing to be beach-ready by summer. I doubt many of us will be mentally prepared to launch ourselves into a warmer climate and inviting sea in July, evenwe are enviably lithe and toned.Obviously,I felt I was getting too heavy, Irsquod feel obliged to knuckle down and deal with it, whatever the date. It is true also that the majority of us could probably benefit from tweaking our menus around the margins. But the longest, blackest and dreariest month of the year is not the time to begin. It is counterintuitive, and possibly even self-defeating, to ask us to turn ourselves into a new and better version of ourselves, ldquothe best me I can be, when our internal clock is on perpetual snooze, coming alive only at the smell of roasted potatoes. When night descends by mid afternoon, and we have barely enough oomph to empty the dishwasher, let alone turn the kitchen into a MasterChef set, our willpower is posted missing.Perhaps I ought simply to bypass the magazine features that show vegetable slurries greener than a David Hockney landscape, or chargrilled chicken served with an acre of al dente field. Yet it is not the promise of slimness that lures me in but the ever-changing science of food. That, and the thought of the guinea pigs who allow themselves to become living laboratories. One such group is the cohort of older women cited in the German science writer Bas Kastrsquos new book, called The Diet Compass.These grandmothers were each given a muffin a day for seven weeks. One lot was baked with sunflower oil, the other with palm oil. Unsurprisingly, everyone gained weight, but those in the second category grew fattest. More cheering is Kastrsquos discovery thatyoursquore over , a very small glass of white wine with dinner works like a catalytic converter, in terms of cholesterol and insulin. After you reach o, however, all benefits fade.

The wording of it is that lsquothe roads authority shall take such steps as they consider reasonable to prevent snow and ice endangering pedestrians and vehicles over public roadsrsquo.ldquoThe thing to take from that is that it doesnrsquot say they must do X, Y and Z, itrsquos that they shall take such steps THEY consider reasonable.ldquoUltimatelythe local authority think what theyrsquove done is reasonable then thatrsquos all they have to do in terms of the Act.ldquoThe lawrsquos evolved to interpret that to mean that they have to do whatrsquos reasonable in the circumstances, and so what they really have to do is have a winter maintenance policy.ldquoThat usually starts with A-roads and then works through priority lists, which is why most peoplersquos streets never get gritted because they never get down that far on the list.Mr Calderwood explained that legally, it is accepted that councils have finite resources and so have to prioritise the roads most used or at risk. This can include routes close to schools or fire stations, as well as A-roads.However, once this policy is in place, councils must stick to it or they may be liable for legal action.ldquoThe main route to take a case against the local authorityyou slip on ice or your car skids off the road because of ice is to see whether theyrsquove actually followed their own policy, he said.ldquoSotheir policy is that they grit A-roadsit hits -C, or something like that, then you can check records and see whether they actually carried out their policy that day. If they didnrsquot carry out their own policy then they are negligent and are liable for any losses that resulted from that.ldquoIn short, they get to decide what they do, but they have to stick to it. They canrsquot change their policy that night because there arenrsquot enough gritters available.Mr Calderwood explained that Thompsons wins several cases each year where councils have failed to follow their winter maintenance policy, often resulting in le-changing consequences for their clients and large payouts from the public bodies.ldquoIt always baffles me as a lawyer as to why councils donrsquot put the proper resources in place, he said.ldquoIt costs them a lot of money to pay claims out and I would far rather see them put the money in place to stop the accidents happening in the first place.The solicitor added that premises occupied by iniduals or businesses need to be maintained and cleared by the occupier. So a supermarket would have to ensure its car park is gritted, while iniduals are responsible for their own driveways and paths."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-universal-credit-claimants-near-500-000-help-requests-soar","story":"Citizens Advice Scotland has pointed to an  per cent increase in people in Scotland now claiming Universal Credit since the start of the pandemic in March  as the scale of the Covid- crisis is made clear.The pound uplt to Universal Credit payments was introduced by the UK Government in April  in response to the first Covid- lockdown which left thousands relying on the benefit.But it is due to expire in March ndash with no indication from Westminster as to whether it will be extended or made permanent, despite speculation Chancellor Rishi Sunak could do so at Marchrsquos Budget.Writing in The Herald, Debbie Horne, senior policy officer at Citizens Advice Scotland, has highlighted that her organisation has provided a staggering , pieces of advice to people on Universal Credit so far during the pandemic - stressing that is ldquomore than double the advice given on Universal Credit in the financial year ending March .She added: ldquoFor all the uncertainty that exists right now, one thing the Citizens Advice network can be sure of is that Universal Credit will continue to be one of our biggest areas of advice over the course of .ldquoMajor decisions on the future of Universal Credit payments will be made in a few short months.

I was told I had a carcinoid tumour which is very rare on my left lung and attached to my windpipe.”Throughout lockdown Joanne regularly attended the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast for treatment.She said: “I started my chemo and laser surgery and I seemed to spend the whole of lockdown between the Royal and my bed.“In November the consultant told me they had lasered enough of the windpipe to do me over Christmas as they had to free up the hospital due to Covid.“I need an operation to remove a quarter of my windpipe and my left lung with everything being bypassed and directed into my right lung. Once I get the operation the tumour should hopefully be taken all away.”Unfortunately Joanne received news that her operation has been delayed.She said: “I was built up for the operation both physically and mentally. After I was told I went into a depression because they said it would be four months.“I have two or three good days but then the rest are bad and at times I am so ill I have to stay in bed. One minute you are doing  miles an hour and then everything just stops.“But I am very lucky to have the support of my daughters and husband as I know the situation is very hard on them too.”Joanne decided to focus on trying to give something back Action Cancer NI and with the help of her father in law, Raymond Lennox, has been creating bespoke wooden planters, bird feeders, Christmas tress and Christmas plaques.The items are being sold at Blossom and Birch, Broughshane Street in Ballymena, which has hosted a number of events in aid of charity, one of which included a gallery night featuring art work by David McAneaney who also works at the florists.Joanne commented: “Between Raymond and myself we have been making a range of items and there has been a big demand for them. It has been good for us both as it has kept us busy and focused. “It is something to keep your mind off things and it keeps us going.”Despite the impending lockdown Joanne and Raymond hope to continue their fundraising efforts and anyone who is interested in purchasing an item can contact Joanne via her facebook page.

There is certainly nothing going on therethat instils confidence in me going forwards.Whether or not our Education Minister is solely responsible, I can#t say - but I do think he is out of touch with what is going on on the ground.I think he is out of his depth and I think it is time that either another party or another Education Minister had a go because it is myself and colleagues like me who are having to manage his indecision.Terry McMaster, principal of Drumahoe Primary said throughout the pandemic planning process, schools had not be listened to, nor had concerns been addressed in a timely manner.One such instance was the th hour announcement that the transfer test scheduled for this weekend would not go ahead. Yesterday it was decided they would not.I think all along, it should have been the Department of Education that said to the two private companies who run the transfer test, #You are not using the schools, we have closed the schools because it goes against the advice of the chief medical officer and the chief scientic officer#.I think that schools have not really been listened to which is a pity because they know the needs of the children best and the needs of the parent but they have not been consulted enough in the process.The Department of Education said it has worked throughout the pandemic to maintain the education of children, to reduce the risk of outbreaks and to respond when these occur.As a result of the current public health situation, all primary and secondary schools will provide remote education. The situation will be kept under ongoing review dependent on public health advice, a spokesperson said.The Minister stressed that these decisions were not made lightly as he is aware of the negative impact on children#s learning and mental health and well-being of not being in school. On the late postponement of the transfer test, the spokesperson said Mr Weir has previously written to selective schools to advise them to ensure that contingency admissions criteria are in place in the event that entrance tests cannot be operated.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday Brexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownSouth East Antrim UDA issue threat against First Minister Arlene FosterNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Latest EducationCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledViewpointOpinionNorthern Ireland pupils failed by last minute Stormont decisionsNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Mark BainOpinionEducation Minister Peter Weir gave transfer test every chance... now calls will only grow to ditch it Latest from Belfast List of news measures brought in by GovernmentRepublicans raise first objection in Congress to Biden winO joins Government free mobile data scheme for schoolchildren in lockdownDecision to allow parents to report schools over remote lessons provokes furyLatest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in England,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Liam McBurney PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFirst Minister Arlene Foster. Liam McBurney PA WireAndrew Madden and Eimear McGovernJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAn order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home will become legally enforceable on Friday, it has been confirmed. The advice is to be put into legislation from midnight on Thursday, with additional powers being given to the PSNI to enforce the measures.The move was agreed by the Executive after it met on Tuesday, along with the tightening of other measures.Amongst the additional restrictions agreed are:Private garden gatherings - maximum of six people from one household or support bubble only, with children under  counting towards the permitted total.Gatherings reduced to maximum of six people from two households. Children under  are now counted towards the permitted total.Outdoor exercise permitted with one person from another household - to allow, for example, those living alone to go for a walk with a friend.People will only be allowed to leave home for medical needs, to buy food or to exercise. Those who cannot work from home will also be allowed leave. It was agreed the measures will last until February  with a review expected on January .Schools in Northern Ireland are also set to undertake remote learning until the mid-term break, it was also confirmed.First Minister Arlene Foster said discussions on exams are ongoing with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, with a decision to be made by Thursday.Mrs Foster said the rising coronavirus cases and hospital admissions were causing grave concern.She added: We confirm that all educational establishments will move to remote learning until the half-term break in the middle of February.It will be reviewed up the end of January. But we want to give those educational establishments the vision ahead into February. So, that is what is happening.That applies to primary schools, post primary schools and indeed to nursery schools as well.Childcare, however, will continue, eventhat is in an educational setting. Childminders will be able to operate as well.Mrs Foster denied the Executive had failed to agree on a way forward for exams.She said: Our educational grading and our GCSEs and A-levels are very integrated into the wider UK system.There#s ongoing discussions with Gavin Williamson, secretary state for education in Westminster, actually the Executive have mandated our education minister to get clarity for these issues.By the end of the executive on Thursday, we will have complete clarity in relation to GCSEs and A-levels.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said the decision to close schools was a reflection on how serious the situation is with the pandemic.She said an Executive meeting could be held on Wednesday to discuss the issue in relation to exams and called on the Education Minister to bring forward proposals.Childcare and special education schools are to remain open, the Deputy First Minister said.Speaking after the Executive meeting, Ms O#Neill said: The message will be stay at home.This will provide additional powers to the PSNI, for example to be able topeople to their homes when they actually come out for reasons that are not allowed under the reasons that you can actually leave your home.There are also additional restrictions to household mixing. So, in private homes and gardens, both indoor and outdoor gatherings will be restricted to members of one household, or a member of your support bubble.There are obviously some exemptions that are for people who live in homes so those things will carry on.Outdoor and indoor gatherings will be restricted. The current position is that  people can meet outside that will be reduced to six people. Again, that#s a necessary intervention at this time.There is still little clarity on transfer tests for entry into grammar schools, which were initially cancelled only for the Association for Quality Education to announce they will hold a single exam in February.On Tuesday, it was confirmed a further  people in Northern Ireland had died after testing positive for Covid-. , new cases of the virus have been reported. It brings the death toll to , and the total number of confirmed cases since the outbreak to ,.

My dependency on it was getting worse,that was possible.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson confirm their marriage FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson confirm their marriage Things finally began to turn around when, as Jonny puts it, he grew a conscience.I was stealing from people and I really didn#t want to be that sort of person so I stopped doing it, he said.I also wanted to quit drugs because of how they were making me feel. Gradually, I managed to wean myself off them.Alcohol, however, was a tougher nut to crack.I#d been trying to quit since I turned , he said.I was bingeing, getting sober for two weeks, then bingeing again... the vicious cycle just went on and on.To complicate matters, Jonny started self-harming.He began by scraping himself, but that soon morphed into something more sinister.I#d been using broken bottles and ended up cutting a vein open in my leg, said Jonny who, by March  - just before he met Tricia - had pretty much given up on le.I#d cut my wrist, severing my median nerve. I was really on a downward spiral and couldn#t see a way out of it, he said.By then, he had been sleeping rough outside an off licence on the Ormeau Road.Someone who works with homeless people finally intervened, taking him to the Stella Maris hostel, where his le would, not immediately but ultimately, turn around.Having met and fell in love with Tricia there, the pair left Stella Maris together in June, moved to a property in Co Down.But although there was emotional salvation, neither party could defeat the demon drink and within a year both of them were back living in the hostel.We had really tried to make an effort but it fell apart, said Jonny.We were also on the streets for a while. Tricia broke her ankle and I had to stay sober because she was in a wheelchair.The onset of the Covid- pandemic coincided with Tricia going into rehab - for a third, and what she is adamant will be the last, time in her troubled le.After Tricia took that big step, Housing First [a service provided by DePaul Charity] found us temporary accommodation in north Belfast because we were both sober at that stage, he said.They spent a year there until their landlord sold the property and they ended up sleeping in a tent in dferent campsites, before then finding another bricks-and-mortar home but it was on the third floor which was a concern for Tricia, who has epilepsy.Through sheer, collective determination, however, they were able to save some money and acquire a one-bedroom apartment last August - their marital, dry home.I haven#t had a drink in eight months and Tricia hasn#t touched it for nine and half, said Jonny.That might not sound like much but that#s massive for us. Previously, I#d never stopped for more than six weeks in my entire le.Jonny is now halfway through an Open University course in planetary science and astronomy and, while he spends the day studying, his new we devotes her time to attending AA meetings and helping others who want to quit.I#m from an alcoholic family, said Tricia, who spent six years on the streets.I was in a children#s home from the age of . I left at , had four kids by the time I was .I didn#t actually drink back then I only started when I was .Unlike her husband, Tricia has never taken drugs but didn#t have any friends.I had some traumatic experiences when I was in my twenties, she admitted.I#d been having problems sleeping until I tried red wine. I didn#t actually like the taste of it but it helped me get over.Tricia told of how she tried to get sober back then but, after a spell in rehab got wine to celebrate coming out.She said she lost virtually everything. Friendless and aged , she ended up on the streets.Drink cost me so much, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson She is still in touch with some, but not all, of her children.Tricia was in and out of Stella Maris for years, trying, and failing, to turn her le around.I was institutionalised, I didn#t know how to be on my own or live on my own, she said.I was drinking straight vodka, and most of my le was a blackout.Some memories she does retain, however, still haunt her every waking moment.I remember sleeping outside McDonald#s with a girl called Catherine Kenny, but she#s dead now. She died on the streets. Catherine called an ambulance for me once, after I#d had a serious epileptic fit.I ended up on a le support machine. When I woke up in the Ulster Hospital I didn#t know where I was or how I#d got there... but all I could think about was drink. I signed myself out of hospital and went straight to the off licence. Then I went back to Stella Maris...Another more pleasant memory: meeting Jonny - although she spent that first night in jail.I thought he was gorgeous, she recalled.I was sitting beside him while he was watching a film, and I got arrested! I#d been arguing with a girl - a friend, actually - and ended up in the cells overnight.When I got out of the police station the next day, I went looking for Jonny.He told me he slept rough on the Ormeau Road so I went up there and found him. That#s where it started.Tricia puts her sobriety purely down to rehab - specically a spell in Cuan Mhuire, Newry, that began at the start of the first Covid- lockdown.I desperately wanted to get sober, she said.Jonny had a small relapse when I was in there. He phoned me drunk. I told him he had to get sober for both our sakes, and he did.After signing up to AA and finding a sponsor, Tricia now attends two virtual meetings a day.She is also helping other alcoholics by giving talks about my journey.She added: If you told me this time last year I#d be sober nine and a half months and married - there#s no way I would#ve believed it.The couple tied the knot at City Hall on December .It was just me and him. My brother was the only guest. It was perfect, said Tricia.The boss of Housing First got us a car, made me a posy and baked me a cake.Tricia - who has one granddaughter aged seven, and two grandsons, aged eight months and five months - said  has easily been the best year of her le.They hope to honeymoon in Poland, when the lockdown restrictions permit.Getting married is the third best thing I#ve ever done, she said.The first was getting sober. The second was getting myself a sponsor in AA and doing the steps, and the third was getting married. I couldn#t have done the third one without the first two.She added: It was so hard to get sober but I think the hardest part is staying there.Christmas was very dferent for Tricia who said last year she was in blackout.Jonny was sober but I was wandering the streets before we went to my dad#s for Christmas dinner, she recalled.This year, Mr and Mrs Dobson had Christmas dinner at Tricia#s dad - only this time they both remember it.The worst part of living on the streets was not knowing who might end up dead beside you the next morning, said Tricia.Jonny added: For me, it was not having access to any facilities. You#re just constantly dirty and broke and you have no options.He added: It#s the first time we can say we#re happy. We#ve got money in the bank, we#ve got options, a bit of security it#s a whole dferent le.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday Brexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownSouth East Antrim UDA issue threat against First Minister Arlene FosterNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Latest Northern IrelandFlouting stay at home order could result in a £, fineNI school chef allegedly raped boy and took photo to ensure his silence, court toldGCSEs and A-levels cancelled in Northern IrelandAround , receive first dose of Covid- vaccine in Northern IrelandBelfast man who threatened to throw acid in colleague#s face after she rejected him jailedLatest from Belfast List of news measures brought in by GovernmentRepublicans raise first objection in Congress to Biden winO joins Government free mobile data scheme for schoolchildren in lockdownDecision to allow parents to report schools over remote lessons provokes furyLatest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in England,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Restrictions were later loosened in the run up to the festive season but that has led to the current spike in virus cases.August Pubs which do not serve food - #wet pubs# - were busy preparing to open their doors for Monday, August , but were hit by a hammer blow as the Executive changed the date to September .However, this date was also cancelled because of a rise in Covid cases.Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill finally threw wet pubs a leline and permitted them to reopen from September .John Bittles, who owns Bittles Bar in Belfast city centre, estimated he lost around £, due to loss of trade.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O#Neill FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichelle O#Neill August Education Minister Peter Weir stood by his assertion that the controversial A-level grading system was fair following a backlash from principals and pupils after exams were cancelled last summer because of the pandemic.The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessmentthen failed to uphold over a third of teachers# estimated grades.Just five days later, Mr Weir performed a U-turn and allowed teachers# predicted grades to be used after strong political opposition to use centralised standardisation.November Families in Northern Ireland were told they could reunite for five days over Christmas after ministers from across the UK agreed to relax coronavirus restrictions.Up to three households were initially permitted to mix in bubbles from December  to December .Christmas plans were then thrown into disarray on December  after the Executive agreed to reduce the five day bubbling arrangements to just one day.The decision came as health officials said they believed a new strain of Covid- was circulating in the region.November Northern Ireland entered a two-week circuit breaker to slow the spread of Covid- and protect health services. Mrs Foster said the tough, carefully timed, intervention was needed to give the best chance to have a safe and happy Christmas and further into the new year period.Unfortunately, the circuit breaker didn#t have the desired effect.Chief Scientic Adviser Prof Ian Young highlighted how the figures for Belfast traffic congestion during the brief lockdown was simply too high and showed the people did not stay at home.

Just turned, went upstairs.I could hear the noise in the front room, a bag being filled... and he came downstairs and said #look, I have to go#, asthe conversation with my father had terminated.He said to my mother: #Don#t worry, I#ll be back to see you frequently#. And that was the only dissent he ever showed throughout his le until that day.

I wasn#t a fool to this, but someone  once said to me: #What made you do the arrangements with the former terrorist Martin McGuinness #And I said: #The word former#.Julie Hambleton#s sister Maxine was one of  people killed in the IRA Birmingham pub bombings in . She said McGuinness# IRA past could never be justied.When you kill one person you destroy a whole nucleus of a family.

PA Wire PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Department of Health has warned services could be hampered by the pandemic. Shaun Keenan, Local Democracy ReporterJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThousands of adults and children missed out on potentially le-saving scans after services grounded to a halt due to Covid-, it has emerged.New figures show the number of patients waiting more than nine weeks for hospital treatment increased to more than , at the end of September.That’s compared to fewer than , on the same date last year.South Eastern Trust patients suffered the worst of setbacks among the six health trusts with a % increase in the number of people waiting more than nine weeks to either get a diagnosis or the all-clear.The data – which have been analysed by the Shared Data Unit – shows the impact of coronavirus on Northern Ireland’s health services.Read MoreLisa Smyth:OpinionConsequences of cost-cutting and staff shortages have never been so starkLockdown in NI #a result of underfunding and chronic lack of nurses#Health boards were asked to suspend all non-urgent elective treatment earlier last year as the NHS was put on an “emergency footing”.The latest data includes waiting times for diagnostic scans including MRI, non-obstetric ultrasound, PET and X-ray scans.The statistics show that , people have been waiting more than two months for a CT or MRI test up to September  in the South Eastern Trust.The health board has a total of , waiting for treatment, with , getting treatment under nine weeks despite the pressures hospitals are facing due to coronavirus.The pandemic has also led to a a backlog of patients awaiting treatment across Northern Ireland.Elsewhere, in total, almost , waited in total for treatment up to September last year across the country – a , increase when compared to the year prior.The Southern Trust had the most patientson their waiting lists, an % increase in the number of peoplewaiting more than nine weeks for treatment.The Belfast Trust also had a % increase in their waiting numbers, , of those waiting more than the set target for an MRI or CT scan.The Department of Healthhad previously set a target of % of patients waiting no more than nine weeks for a diagnostic test, with no patient waiting longer than  weeks by March this year.The Northern Trust – which had the highest number of patients on waiting lists in  – reduced that number from , to ,. Around , of those patients have waited more than two months for diagnostic test.Meanwhile, the Western Trust had the lowest numbers anywhere in Northern Irelanddespite more than twice the numberof people waiting several months for treatment.Jodie Moffatt, head of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK said she was “very concerned” about the impact the virus will have on cancer.She added: “Theof time people are waiting for a scan will be having a negative impact on their diagnosis.“Those patients could be diagnosed with a more aggressive, later stage cancer. That will limit the treatment options available to them also.“There is a cohort of patients out there that have not been diagnosed yet – and who knows what state they will be in when they are.”The DoH said they expected the figures would be “even worse” following the Covid- pandemic.However, a spokesperson for the DoH said while elected waiting times were “unacceptable” before the pandemic, Covid- had “inevitable and serious impact” on waiting lists here.A DoH spokesperson said: “The minister of health remains committed to these priorities albeit the timescale and the scale at which the unacceptable waiting lists can be tackled will be greatly influenced by the ongoing impact of Covid-.“The availability of sustained and substantial investment and additional staffing will also be critical in reducing waiting times and the minister will work with his Executive colleagues in this regard.”Consultant radiologist Dr Nick Screaton, vice president of the British Institute of Radiologists said the backlog had a “big impact” on those with more advanced cancer and heart disease.He said there would need to be a “multi-faceted approach”a solution was to be found over the next “five-year period”.“We need to recruit from abroad and I know trusts are already making great efforts to do that,” Dr Screaton said.“It is important to reinforce the scanner capacity as well – it isn’t just a workforce issue. For example those hospitals with only one scanner cannot operate a ‘hot’ and a ‘cold’ one for Covid and non-Covid patients.“Smaller hospitals are more likely to have been hit harder in the amount of scans carried out.“The NHS will also have to think more broadly about doing things dferently. I think people will be much more willing to listen to the idea of regional diagnostic hubs as a result of the crisis.”Belfast Related ContentHealth PremiumLisa SmythOpinionConsequences of cost-cutting and staff shortages have never been so starkThis time last year, thousands of healthcare workers were staging strike action in a row over patient safety.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Facilities at Watty Graham GAC, Glen, were damaged on Saturday night after a vehicle was driven onto the main pitch. The club, who experienced a similar incident just two years ago, posted images of the damage on their social media accounts on Sunday morning, branding those responsible as morons. “Yet again our facilities have been damaged by alcohol fuelled morons. Very dficult to understand their mentality. Experience suggests that the culprits didnt travel very far,” the post stated. Some of the damage caused at Watty Grahams GAC, Glen. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Councillor for the area, Brian McGuigan, said the vandalism was an attack on the entire community. “Watty Graham Park is a community facility paid for, maintained and run by the community,” he told the County Derry Post. “I am appalled that the playing surface, maintained all year round by the dedicated volunteers at Watty Graham GAC has been extensively damaged by culprits who not only attacked the GAA facilities but have attacked the entire community. “The club volunteers of Watty Grahams have been working tirelessly alongside community groups within Maghera, helping the elderly and vulnerable during the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “This is a community working together and a community that is angry at the latest act of anti-social activity to blight the area. “It is unbelievable that a person or persons would carry out such a mindless act of vandalism on the community and the facilities. These people need to wise up and get off the communitys back.” Fellow councillor Martin Kearney also condemned the vandalism. “I deplore the recent vandalism to the Watty Grahams Pitch,” he said. “This is not the first time they have been attacked in this way. It is very disappointing when they have served the wider community so faithfully during the ongoing pandemic.     Police appeal A police spokesperson said they were aware of the incident and appealed to anyone with information to come forward. “Police in Magherafelt are appealing for information about criminal damage caused to a football pitch on Falgortrevy Road, Maghera sometime over the weekend,” they said. “It is believed that between pm on Saturdayand pm on Sunday , entry was gained to the grounds of a sports club. “A vehicle is believed to have been driven onto the pitch, performing manoeuvres that caused damage to the grass. “Enquiries are continuing, and we are appealing to anyone with information about this incident to call us on .” Information about the incident can also be passed on to investigating officers through the reporting section on the PNSIs website.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books. They become familiar with the characters and enjoy the new vocabulary in each story. My stories are intentionally short with the aim of retaining the childrsquos interest.ldquoThe language is at the childrsquos level, Kathleen continued. ldquoI have used repetitive language because this is a great way to encourage early words and sounds. My hope is not only to help a child develop their speech and language skills but also to foster a love for reading.The first of Kathleenrsquos books is entitled Boomer and Blanky On the Farm. Therersquos no water on Hollybush Farm and the two central characters come to the rescue in a delightfully written and beautully illustrated story. Other adventures featuring the two heroes will appear in .Kathleen was brought up on a farm and now helps her husband, John, and three sons whenever she can.

On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door.

The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man.

Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring.

The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

The pupils I spoke to were confident and articulate users of the digital resources at their disposal. The school has developed effective support links during the pandemic to support distance learning.St Josephrsquos also received a special recognition badge last month for Cyber Resilience and Internet Safety, becoming the third primary school in Northern Ireland to be awarded this badge.The school had completed a pioneering education initiative developed to encourage online safety and cyber resilience amongst pupils in schools.The assessment report noted: lsquoSt Josephrsquos is a dynamic school which has a careful, considered and planned approach to developing and delivering a safe and secure digital technology learning environment for their pupils and have fully engaged their parental community in this development.rsquoPrincipal Laura Fitzsimons said: ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded these prestigious titles which highlight the schoolrsquos continual investment in resources and training.ldquoWe are very pleased and proud of our teachers, student digital leaders and all our pupils for their commitment to digital learning.ldquoIt was particularly pleasing to receive this positive news in light of the challenging times which we are currently living in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Talking.jpg","title":"Talking about coercive control  ","story":"TODAY there are mothers and their children from the wider Downpatrick area living in refuges run by Womenrsquos Aid.There may be more over the Christmas and New Year period as the festive time can be a dangerous time for people living with their abuser.The prospect of a six-week lockdown means that demand for help is also set to increase as Womenrsquos Aid supported , women and children during the last lockdown.Eileen Murphy, chief executive officer of the charity, has in her -plus years of working provided support to women from the Downpatrick area.Based in Newry, she works closely with the South Eastern Domestic Violence Partnership run by the local Health Trust and in partnership with other agencies, including the PSNI.ldquoOur refuges run at % capacity but we also work with many women who never stay in our refuges, said Eileen.She is all too aware of the worry and fear that some women will be experiencing over the holiday period.ldquoMothers will be trying to make the best Christmas Day possible for their children, no matter the situation. They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways.

People who do not qualy on grounds such as having a sibling will lose out on a place, which is profoundly unfair.The grammar schools themselves, and their supporters, share some blame for the current situation. Aside from a handful of people, such as the academic Dr William Kitchen on these pages , there has been a serious failure to challenge the emotional rhetoric around testing.Northern Ireland needs grammar schools, albeit perhaps a smaller number of them. It also needs outstanding non grammar schools. There should not be a winner-takes-all system.Meanwhile, it is good to hear teachers such as the retired principal Hugh McCarthy, opposite , to the head of St Ronan’s Primary School in Newry, Kevin Donaghy, speak up about what the latter describes as the “disaster” of school closures.We need always to be mindful of that disaster. Instead of thinking in terms of long closures and cancelled summer exams, we need to think in terms of getting pupils back to class as soon as is practicable.• Dr William Kitchen: Grammar schools in Northern Ireland are right to stand by academic selection• Hugh McCarthy: Education is le-changing and it is shameful to deny it to children• Closing NI schools a disaster for children – principal• Dr William Kitchen: Scrapping the transfer test this year could be the end of grammar schools in NI• Ben Lowry: Covid will be used to undermine grammar schools——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We are separated from the rest of the UK because we were deemed expendable by the DUPs erstwhile allies in the ERGand their English nationalist Tory cousins.We are being patronised that there are no controls on NI GB movements as though we should be grateful we can trade within our own country without customs. It is constitutionally offensive. I note that the secretary of state, Brandon Lewis MP, has stated that there is no ‘Irish Sea Border’. I would like to ask him and his Conservative Party colleagues, do they not understand what they have signed up to  It was clear that’s what happened when they introduced the Internal Market Bill last year. I would love to see the ERG and Boris do the same for Yorkshire to Cornwall trade. This is a massive breach of the Belfast Agreement which says that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland can only change with the people of Northern Ireland’s consent.I voted for and campaigned to remain during the European referendum of  as I had serious concerns about the only Union that really matters which is that of the United Kingdom. Many people I know voted to leave, but there is no way the majority would have done so had they known that the price of Brexit was economic separation between Great Britain and Northern Ireland with border control posts established in Northern Ireland to administer EU single market and customs rules.When you are on the western peninsula of Europe with an underdeveloped private sector, all markets are important, but by far our biggest trading route is between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No amount of spin can ignore these facts that there is a regulatory border down the Irish Sea separating us from Great Britain. Given that these barriers to trade were imposed on us by the Northern Ireland Protocol agreed between the UK government and the EU, it is incumbent on the UK government to activate the appropriate safeguarding measures under Article  of the protocol to protect businesses from the turbulence of obstacles being erected on our biggest trading route.Article  says thatthe application of the protocol leads to “serious economic, societal or environmental dficulties that are liable to persist, or to ersion of trade, the Union or the United Kingdom may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures”.• Alderman Mark Cosgrove is the Ulster Unionist Group leader on Antrim and Newtonabbey Borough Council and is the party’s business spokesperson.

Is it beyond us to deliver a project which would have the potential of bringing our people together as well as positively selling Northern Ireland to the wider world I propose that work be commissioned to examine the potential for a regional sports museum to be builtwhere there exists the necessary infrastructure to build such a facility and connect it to local visitors but also for those arriving internationally.\"Another Northern Ireland sporting great Joey DunlopOver the years Northern Ireland and our people have punched well above our weight in terms of sporting success. Whether that be road racing, horse racing and show jumping, golf, athletics, boxing, snooker, rugby, inidual footballers we’ve produced, the talent within Gaelic football and hurling etc.We are also home to other rich sports such as handball, road bowls, rounders and we have a proud history of success and development opportunities for those competing in disability based sports and events.In Joey Dunlop, George Best and Alex Higgins we have arguably the most naturally gted in their respective sports.But there are so many other iconic iniduals and teams who have excelled over the last century, bringing joy and positivity to this place, our people and also helping position Northern Ireland’s place in the world, securing the respect and admiration of others along the way.Such a museum could play host to preserving magical moments like the Dennis Taylor  snooker final black ball finish, Mary Peters heroics on the track, Joey Dunlop and Jonathan Rea on the back of motorcycles, our Golfers winning majors, Ulster Rugby heroics, AP McCoy Champion Jockey, our warriors in the ring and the many special Ulster County and Club performances which saw successes at Ulster Provincial and all-Ireland level etc.So my question is: do our leaders genuinely want to celebrate success and the achievements of the incredible people who make up this place  If so then a golden opportunity to do something about it exists.

Instead, we have ato order after a five-year long national psychodrama.The prime minister is now in ‘levelling up’ mode, just what we need. Interventionism is winning, not free-market mayhem. We can expect to see massive infrastructural investment, and investment support for businesses.Even a new foreign policy is emerging, recognising the importance of new diplomatic networks, as well as new trade deals. We have many friends. A few of them are more precious, and many of them more steady, than some of our immediate neighbours.Sir Keir Starmer has rightly moved on from Brexit to argue for national renewal, saying now is not the time for a second Scottish independence referendum.

He said on Monday night that the empty shelves at Tesco’s huge Knocknagoney store on the outskirts of east Belfast were“noticeable”.Tesco told the News Letter that it had “a good supply of products coming into Northern Ireland” but admitted that “there has been a short delay on certain products”. It said it was working “to get these back on the shelves as quickly as possible and direct customers to alternatives where we can”.In Sainsbury’s large Forestside store in south east Belfast an entire aisle of vegetables was virtually empty and – as revealed by this newspaper yesterday – hundreds of items are disappearing as they sell out and being replaced on an emergency basis by products sourced locally, including own-brand produce from rival supermarket Spar.Read More Read MoreDays after Brexit, many products vanish from Sainsbury’s in Northern Ireland and...To a lesser extent, there were signicant gaps in Marks  Spencer’s Forestsidefood store and in Lidl’s Castlereagh Road store.A spokesman for MS said that they had been well-prepared for Brexit and their stores were “receiving regular deliveries”.\u2028Two months ago MS set up a single “export centre”in Motherwell to handle all of its deliveries to Northern Ireland and the Republic.Asda said that it had“not experienced any issues in getting Asda lorries across the [Irish Sea] border following the end of Brexit transition period” and so “this isn’t the reason for any availability issues”.At the other end of the grocery spectrum, small business Causeway Organic supplied about  households on the north coast with vegetable boxes– until receiving an unexpected message on Monday.Owner Jonathan Owens, who said he had spent months nurturing the business, was forced to email his customers on Monday night to say that his importer had told him “there is an extra layer of red tape they were previously unaware of on top of what I’d already gone through involved in bringing the pallet across into NI”.Last night Mr Owens told the News Letter that he had been forced to suspend his business and would be refunding his customers.He said: “The impression I got from the people helping me in Belfast to manage orders was the [customs] commodity codes was all that was required to get vegetables through ports.”Now as I understand it you need aphytosanitary certicate for each and every item on the pallet, which would potentially double the cost of every item.”Mr Owens said that he was still hopefulthat he could find another supplier, but added: “If it just becomes insurmountable, then bluntlythat’s the end of the business.”He expressed derision for the Secretary of State’s public insistence that “there is no border in the Irish Sea”.He added: “It’s incredibly hard not to be angry.

All centres have adequate car parking and public transport access to meet the service need.This is an exciting development in the NHS fight against Covid- with access to a vaccination imminent.The UHB has been working closely with partners to prepare for the vaccination including recruitment of staff, implementation of IT and digital solutions to manage the programme and storage and delivery of the vaccination to ensure the health board is able to mobilise quickly.Approximately , people across Cardf and Vale UHB will be eligible for a Covid- vaccination, as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationwith the mass vaccination programme estimated to take nine- months to be delivered.Priority groups will be identied by JCVI and contacted to book an appointment when the centres are ready to receive them with health and social care workers and care homes identied as the first priority groups.The centre in Splott will be used first and is will be ready to deliver the vaccine from December.The centres in Barry and Pentwyn are not likely to be stood up until January in line with vaccination quantities expected through the UK government.Executive director of Public Health at Cardf and Vale UHB, Fiona Kinghorn said ldquoCovid- has been a big part of our lives over the last year and this is promising news that we are now in a position to deliver a vaccination when it becomes available.ldquoA lot of work has been going on behind the scenes to identy suitable venues, recruit staff, set up a booking line and implement processes for the storage and transportation of the vaccination to get us ready to protect the population of Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan.ldquoWhile the vaccination programme will take time it is important that we all still adhere to the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales guidance and ensure we are social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings in public places to limit the spread of the virus.For information on the vaccination, visit the Public Health Wales website article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service.

As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
