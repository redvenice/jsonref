He is the first person of colour to win in prize’s 64-year history. Chair of judges Julia Hale said that every detail of Tales from the Inner City marked it “as a masterwork of illustration that generates an outstanding experience for the reader” and called it “a stunning book that should be widely shared and celebrated”.She added: “Never have the bonds between us and the beautiful creatures we share the Earth with been so exquisitely rendered.”Tan called the book “a strange book for strange times” and said he was “surprised, delighted and then deeply honoured” to win and to be “in the fine company of so many brilliant artists and authors, many of whom inspired my own love of illustrated stories as a young Western Australian scribbler”.“To know that I am not alone in enjoying such speculation – maybe even a bit too much – is no small thing. It is profoundly consoling, to feel part of a larger conversation about our relationship to this planet, particularly with younger readers, in whose imagination the future is already taking shape,” he added.British author Anthony McGowan was announced as the winner of the Carnegie medal for children’s and young adult fiction for his novel Lark, about two brothers caught in a blizzard on the North Yorkshire moors. McGowan joins a roster of former winners dating back to 1936 including CS Lewis, Noel Streatfeild and Arthur Ransome.The Carnegie judges praised Lark’s “clear, simple storytelling combining authentic characters and realistic situations in pared-down prose with blunt humour, genuine tension and moments of pure poetry as fleeting and transcendent as birdsong.”“It is incredible that such a rich reading experience is in no way impeded by its short and accessible form, indeed it is a strength,” said Hale of the novel, which is published by dyslexia-friendly small press Barrington Stoke. “The book leaves the reader with hope for the future that through the bonds of love from friends and family things can and will get better.”McGowan said that on one level, Lark was a “simple adventure story” in which two brothers’ fun day out “turns into a desperate struggle for survival”. But on another level, he said, “the book is about the unshakable love between two brothers, one of them with special needs, after enduring family breakup, poverty, bullying and cruelty”.The author, who has been in the running for the Carnegie in the past, said that every children’s writer dreamed of winning the medal, with its roll call of former winners and the rigour of the librarian jury’s selection process making it “the greatest book prize in the world”.Organisers said that by showing children a range of perspectives and lived experiences through relatable stories, this year’s winners reflect the awards’ mission “to celebrate and represent a erse range of experiences”. Following an outcry over an all-white, 20-book longlist for the Carnegie in 2017, the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, which runs the prizes, launched an independent review that uncovered a lack of awareness of books written by authors of colour among UK librarians."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb6f6494296cfaebc286e26413b241141dd6963/0_28_4602_2761/master/4602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16cb43b37c5103e40c9b7aea9b5024fc","title":"hooray football is starting again but hang on im dreading it ","story":"As the top isions in England and Wales get under way I feel like a kid knowing Santa is coming with something wonderful – or something awfulI confess to you, my sporting brothers and sisters, that I am dreading the return of football. I keep getting stopped in the street by people assuming I share their joy. I pull happy faces for them, but I mainly feel dread. Emotionally, I have long had far too much riding on my team lockdown afforded some blessed relief. As of this Saturday, I get back to my old, enervating normal: if West Brom lose I am far too unhappy, and if we win I go too far the other way.A while ago I saw a hypnotherapist for some guidance on how to get back to sleep when I woke up in the middle of the night. I was experiencing everything from general disquiet to wide-eyed terror. He suggested imagining myself in my happiest place. For many this was a beach, he suggested. Not for me it wasn’t. My happy place was the footpath next to a railway line in Smethwick that I would be walking along after we had won. To put myself there is truly to be swathed in serenity, and sleep soon comes. But if it doesn’t come quickly enough, everything backfires and the whites of my eyes gleam with fear anew. Because in my happy mental place, as in the real thing, I know that football joy is only a precursor to some fresh hell sooner rather than later. By the time I have walked back to the car, the joy of the victory is already being overwhelmed by concern about the next match. And so it goes on.Fifteen years ago I wrote a book that attempted to analyse what goes on in football fans’ heads. My cohort for this study was made up of fellow West Brom supporters. I spoke to fans who had not missed a game in decades, fans who had not missed a game in decades but then abruptly stopped going, and some who didn’t go to their first game until they were into middle age but then became as obsessed as any of us. I met one guy who travelled to every match but never watched the game because he was too nervous. He sat in the pub instead. And there was a teenage girl who had been going all her life and had never seen us concede a goal. This she had achieved by burying her head under her dad’s arm whenever the opposition looked likely to score. I took a consultant psychiatrist to a match to meet some of these people. Her conclusion was that ultimately they all seemed better psychologically equipped to deal with their football feelings than I was.For the few of you still reading even though you’re not into football, I should explain that with professional games for the top two isions resuming in England and Wales, my team are, along with Leeds United, hot favourites for promotion to the Premier League. I would be dreading this weekend much less if we weren’t. It’s ours to throw away – which, naturally, is what I inevitably, viscerally, unquestionably expect us to do. The fear is very real it’s on the attack, sweeping its way through my ill-marshalled emotional defences.I’m like this at the start of every season, but this is even worse. There’s not a whole nine months of ebb and flow ahead of us. With but nine games to play there will be scant opportunity to put right the damage of a poor start. It’s like watching England drawing in a World Cup semi-final at the end of extra time – but then having to wait three months for the penalty shootout.Also, in normal times, much of my anxiety would be related to working out how I could organise myself and, selfishly, my loved ones, around the practicalities of me disappearing to get to games. Now, with supporters not allowed in grounds, there’s not even this distraction. No, this will be pure, unadulterated footballing stress played out in eerie quiet, watched by fans everywhere in silent rooms with few shoulders to cry on.I feel like a kid on Christmas Eve, but with the knowledge that Santa will leave either something dreadful for me or something wonderful. Either way, I suppose, I can’t wait any longer. For better or for worse, bring it on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdef5b68232223c63bcbdf6f7dc46debadd3f25c/0_340_5106_3064/master/5106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f853a6bd5d97af02bce1ab05bdf8664","title":"the guardian view on a second wave hoping for the best is not enough","story":"New cases in China and New Zealand highlight the risks of coronavirus resurging, and show why Britain must do betterIt isn’t over. In England, shoppers flock to stores, as eager for novelty as acquisitions some children at least are back in school even zoos have reopened their gates. The sense of relief, however tentative, is palpable. It is also premature.As lockdown eases, uncannily familiar news emerges from China. After weeks without a locally transmitted case, an “extremely severe” outbreak linked to a food market has spread to half of Beijing’s districts and to other provinces. The capital has raised its emergency level, suspended schools and cancelled hundreds of flights. In New Zealand, which had seen no cases for 24 days and had lifted all domestic restrictions, two new arrivals have tested positive and 320 of their contacts are being traced.These developments are a potent reminder of the persistence of coronavirus and the dangers of second waves. Internationally, 100,000 new cases are being confirmed daily. Even places that seem to have weathered the worst must stay alert to the risk of resurgence, the World Health Organization’s chief has warned. There is no guarantee that a vaccine will end the pandemic, and even if an effective one is found it is unlikely to be delivered quickly. That a cheap steroid, dexamethasone, seems to significantly reduce the risk of sick patients dying is a welcome piece of good news but it only reduces the terrible damage wreaked by the virus. Wearing face masks and keeping a distance from people can cut transmission and slow the spread, but not end it.Yet China and New Zealand also show that we do not need to stand by and let coronavirus do its worst. The costs of doing so are evident in the US, where six states are seeing record numbers of cases. Mike Pence, the vice-president, is at least correct to argue that people should not be talking about a second wave – but only because this is a continuation of the first.In contrast, China is pursuing eradication. It is testing hundreds of thousands of people within days, for an outbreak which has so far involved just 137 cases. Contrary to some suggestions, authoritarianism is not the key to curbing the spread of the virus Taiwan, a vibrant democracy, has been extraordinarily effective. The answer is not the most draconian measures or unhindered surveillance but rigour. In New Zealand, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has been clear that the new cases reflect an unacceptable failure the infected pair had been released early from quarantine without being tested.Even in Europe, where the focus has been on containment and mitigation, Britain is an outlier. It waited longer to lock down abandoned testing failed to provide adequate PPE or recognise the risk to care homes. England has led the way in relaxing restrictions while infection and death rates are still high and is still struggling to implement an effective test and trace system. The contact-tracing app expected in spring is now promised for winter. The prime minister boasts that “we have turned the tide”. The government will reportedly tell 2.2 million “clinically extremely vulnerable” people that it will end food and medicine deliveries to them from the end of July and that they no longer need to isolate themselves at home. Yet the UK reported 1,279 new cases on Tuesday and 233 deaths.Downing Street is now driven by opinion polls and alarming economic indicators, not science. Increasingly, its strategy looks like telling people – including the most vulnerable – that it is safe enough and they can take their chances. There are worrying signs that some are growing laxer in keeping a distance. But it is hard to blame them when they are gaining unwarranted reassurance from authorities. Others are, rightly, sceptical. There can be no real return to normal as long as they fear they are endangering themselves by returning to old habits.The effects of lockdown have been punishing, and are most painful for those who were already disadvantaged. But we should not accept a false choice between never-ending domestic isolation and penury on the one hand, and risking large numbers of lives on the other. A rigorous system of test, trace and isolation can protect us. After so many disastrous errors, the government must get this right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8fea36728e22efe9a98adccd91bcb62f0c89165/0_237_3618_2170/master/3618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05f0f7e8f77d93e787de80536f1f85ad","title":"what im really watching dark towers","story":"As a newly appointed homeschooler, our writer finds there’s still a lot to learn from an endearingly pure – and yet deeply disturbing – artefact of 80s BBC educational programmingAt primary school, I had an incredible time learning incredibly little. Lessons were wild, teachers were sport and I made friends who have lasted me until middle age.For most of my life, I’ve considered these not only memories but principles: more than anything, children need to be happy, and there’s plenty of time for serious stuff later on. But then my daughter went into reception and – amazingly – I began to swither, theorising that she is not me, so her circumstances are different from mine. And then coronavirus appointed me headmaster of Harris homeschool and – amazingly – I became absolutely certain, announcing that things needed achieving.Following discussion with the chairman of the governors, formerly known as my wife, non-essential subjects were quickly binned to focus on skills, rather than information, alongside a bespoke programme of enrichment studies, ie, liking the stuff we like. Meanwhile, I furnished myself with a new suite of parental neuroses: how do I bestow the benefit of a one-on-one education from someone existentially invested in the outcome, while maintaining a father-daughter dynamic, while assuming a new role of best friend, while ensuring demarcation between home and school, while not being an overbearing moron at a time of intense stress such as to cause permanent psychological damage? This is a rhetorical question, not because everyone knows the answer but because there is no answer.All of which is a long-winded way of saying that what I’m really watching is not a lot. By the end of each day I’m so drained and occasionally elated that I offer even less resistance than usual to my boss’s Real Housewives imposition, every minute of which was justified the moment Porsha congratulated Eva for the “social distancing” performed by her “titties”.In the end we opted to omit that from the curriculum, but as part of tutoring my daughter in the ways of righteousness I decided that we should watch Dark Towers – made in 1981 as part of the BBC’s Look and Read series. If you went to school in the UK, you’ll likely be familiar with the genre: a story is told over the course of a few weeks, around which language and grammar are taught by presenters in outfits running the full spectrum of beige to brown, and who look 64 but are in fact 23.If Dark Towers was one of yours, you’ll definitely remember its magnificent theme tune and almost definitely remember an accordant nightmare epidemic – which stopped our class watching the final few episodes. Though I wasn’t one of those who let on, I’d be lying if I made out I was revisiting some childhood happy place. But Dark Towers was was one of the first stories to incite in me a visceral reaction, and if parenting is about preparing kids for the world, then squashing anxiety and maintaining perspective are handy things for them to know.I wondered whether the experience would be diluted by watching on a normal telly rather than a tardis on stilts that required a physics degree to operate. But the show shifted medium seamlessly, and its epic, sprawling, soaring introduction remains just brilliant as I remembered – though now I’m desperate for a Tenaglia remix.I must confess, though, that I’d half-forgotten about Wordy, an orange floating-head droid with letter zits. He and the presenter – clad in head-to-toe ginger, a phenomenal turn-up for the books – use the library they’re in, along with a collection of songs from the legendary Geordie Racer, to inculcate a love of words, wordplay, books and expression. I conceal my smirk when the “Magic E” ditty comes on, but the purity of it all is actually quite moving.But centrepiece of the show is the story – written by Andrew Davies who, though he never again scaled such lofty heights, went on to enjoy a fairly decent career. And what an opening he delivers here! “Tracy was a loner,” a voiceover intones. “She thought boys were daft … and she thought girls were daft!”Where to go after that? Well, “I like books better than people” – offered by Lord Edward Dark, the young heir to the eponymous edifice – isn’t a bad effort, and his relationship with Tracy offers a classic oddballs-make-friends subplot. But the principal narrative follows their bid to save the crumbling towers from the various crooks – one played by a youthful Christopher Biggins – who are after its treasure. To this end, they are helped by various supernatural happenings: “Would you be scared if you saw a ghost?” asks the voiceover in episode four, sweeping up any kids still unpetrified.\u0026nbspOn this basis, my daughter eventually decided that Dark Towers wasn’t for her. I deployed my usual it’s only a story shtick, as well as reminding her to face fear and persevere. But she would have none of it and, as the plot progressed, I began to re-evaluate my own advice. “Girls\u0026nbspwere not like you in my day”, the friendly ghost tells Tracy condescendingly “You read far too many books,” Edward’s dad chides him “I don’t trust anyone,” Bunce surmises. Which is to say that the switched on, pleasant characters are kids and the ignorant, stubborn, mendacious fuckwits are adults.It’s a weird thing, being an adult, and an even weirder thing being a parent. You assume authority for shaping another person, then through example and indoctrination encourage them to be like you when sometimes even you don’t want to be like you. The pressure is awesome, the love overwhelming and the scope for error daunting. Whatever goes right feels like nature and whatever goes wrong feels like nurture.All of this is exacerbated by lockdown, the claustrophobic sameness magnifying feelings and multiplying flashpoints, with each day raising new versions of the same essential quandaries: take joy wherever you find it … but 17 biscuits and eight telly hours might be excessive. Unusual times provoke unusual behaviours … but new bad habits mustn’t ingrain leniency is key at such a difficult time … but WHY YOU LITTLE! It’s a lot.So, though I started Dark Towers to close a door from my own childhood, it resonated with me because of the one currently in progress, for which I am responsible. Watching it, I was reassured that sometimes kids know what’s best for them, and the joy of seeing them think, emote and express is a strong one – even when you’d prefer them to just do what you say. What my daughter needs is not necessarily what I needed, and the one thing of which I can be sure is that the world does not require another me. Only Bond villains seek to clone themselves.Very clearly, the parents in Dark Towers are failing at their principal job – raising happy children – which, in a pandemic, is a parent’s only job. If you teach them stuff, that’s great, but if you teach them to love being alive, that’s enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce07a2fe738399bc6e256c1f6a63ca398a10a74/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdee35f5170171752352a7e7f7928776","title":"tell us are you helping uk school children get free meals","story":"We’d like to hear from local initiatives helping to feed disadvantaged children struggling to access free school mealsMarcus Rashford has put pressure on the government to extend its free school meals voucher system for low-income families over the summer holiday period.The footballer’s call – rejected by the prime minister – comes after the scheme in England was extended over the Easter holiday to ensure the 1.3 million children entitled to the free meals did not go hungry during the coronavirus crisis.But the scheme has been beset with problems while many schools remain closed to most pupils, sometimes leaving local initiatives to plug the gaps.Have you helped children get free meals during the lockdown?

Many have not accessed any remote learning throughout lockdown.The multi-million-pound programme, to be funded by government, is expected to involve thousands of tutors and will be delivered in schools, with a mixture of online and face-to-face sessions, designed to support and complement pupils’ regular school work.The catch-up lessons will be available to pupils from all year groups in both primary and secondary and can be accessed by all schools, but will be targeted particularly at those serving disadvantaged communities where learning loss is likely to be greatest.The detail of the comprehensive tuition scheme is being finalised ready to be announced later this week, as the government tries to head off scathing criticism of its handling of children’s education during the pandemic.One study last week found that around 2 million children in the UK have done little or no schoolwork throughout.Union leaders reacted cautiously to the proposals, saying ministers couldn’t just present ideas that “simply sound good”, and raised concerns about whether it was possible to scale up the provision of private tutoring.Boris Johnson, under pressure during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, told MPs his education secretary Gavin Williamson would announce a “big catch-up plan” for pupils very shortly. “It’s vital that kids get the catch-up on the education they have lost,” he said.The government is encouraging secondary schools to bring in pupils for a one-off face-to-face review meeting before the end of term to find out what progress the student has made and what additional support might be required going into the next academic year.Some academy trusts are also looking at bringing in pupils a week early before the start of the autumn term to enable teachers to identify learning gaps and start preparing students for the rigours of academic study after a long gap.Hamid Patel, the chief executive of Star Academies trust that operates 29 state schools in England, said his group planned to help those most affected by the prolonged absence, including disadvantaged pupils and the year groups at significant transition points or facing exams next year.“Our strategy to bridge widening gaps, foster resilience and set our pupils up for success is built on planned interventions over a 12-month period. We intend to use a set of measures including summer holiday camp, Saturday school and planned literacy and numeracy catch-up sessions within the school timetable.”The government’s tuition programme is expected to be available from September and will form one of the main strands in the government’s education catch-up offer. “The overall catch-up package is quite significant,” said one source close to the project. “It will be long-term, at least a year. All schools will be able to access it, but it will be targeted at those with high numbers of disadvantaged pupils.”Summer holiday schemes are more likely to focus on sports, arts and citizenship – rather than academic work – with the aim of supporting pupils’ mental health and physical wellbeing after being locked down at home throughout the pandemic.The Sutton Trust, Education Endowment Foundation, Nesta and Impetus, who earlier this month jointly launched a new online tuition pilot to support disadvantaged pupils as schools began to open to more pupils, are expected to be involved in developing the catch-up tutoring programme.Launching the pilot, they quoted evidence supporting the use of one-to-one and small-group tuition as a cost-effective way to help pupils who are struggling regular sessions of 30 minutes, three to five times a week over six to 12 weeks, to achieve the best results, adding five additional months’ progress.One of the four models being piloted involved the Tutor Trust – a not-for-profit charity which recruits and trains university students and recent graduates as tutors in the core subjects of maths, English and science – who provide one-to-one tuition in state schools. The charity’s co-founder and chief executive, Nick Bent, said: “We want to play our part in this national effort to help disadvantaged pupils catch up.”Leora Cruddas, the chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said it was vital that the government’s catch-up programme should be a long-term endeavour, rather than just a summer holiday scheme. “Where tuition can have value is where it’s done alongside the curriculum. If the government is going to be spending money, I would suggest that those programmes start in the autumn and are strongly aligned with the work a school is doing.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “With so much legitimate concern about the growing gap between advantaged and disadvantaged young people, it’s essential that any plans to address the issue are based in evidence of what works rather than what may simply sound good.“The starting-point should be a review by the child’s teacher of where the child is now, and what their curriculum needs to look like. Schools should then be able to direct any additional resources, such as 1:1 after-school tuition, small group work, textbooks, to turbo-charge pupils’ learning.”Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We’ve got nothing against extra support for literacy and numeracy. The question with all these things is, if you are using private providers, how easy is it to scale up.”Meanwhile, more than 1,500 of the UK’s leading paediatricians and child health specialists have told Boris Johnson he needs to urgently publish the government’s plans for children to return to school, in an unprecedented warning that their absence “risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people”.The letter circulated by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) – the first time it has asked its members to sign a joint message to the prime minister – quickly attracted hundreds of signatures in support of its blunt message: “Left unchecked, Covid-19 will exacerbate existing problems and deepen structural social and health inequalities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c459c3ed7d0fcf3f365dd192ed56ec613fa525/1_0_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f25f97aef5ddbe2c07b383ee4654a07f","title":"my lockdown spring watch a photo essay","story":" sports photographer  Tom Jenkins follows up his popular take on tulips during the enforced break from action photography. Here he talks about how photographing a pair of long-tailed tits nesting in his front garden helped him through a difficult spring“Bum barrels twit on bush and treeScarse bigger then a bumble beeAnd in a white thorn’s leafy restIt builds its curious pudding-nestWi hole beside as if a mouseHad built the little barrel house.”Recently, I was told that I was showing classic signs of “biophilia” – I had to open a dictionary to learn this meant enjoying “the love of life or living systems” and displaying the psychological condition of being attracted to all that is alive and vital. I had just published a picture essay about some tulips that were flourishing in my back garden. I was nervous submitting it – here was a sports photographer, denied his usual fare because of the pandemic, trying his hand at something very different. I was pleasantly surprised by the response, with far more people getting in touch than I’ve ever had for a sports story.\u0026nbspThe tulips died down, but sport was nowhere near a return. I needed something else and, fortunately, nature handed me another gift, a project that would test my photographic skills and give me the adrenaline buzz that I desperately missed from my normal job.Just as lockdown had fully kicked in around my north London home, I couldn’t help but notice two tiny birds flitting around my front garden. I was a complete bird novice. I knew robins, mainly because of Christmas cards, and other birds because they were nicknames of football teams – magpies, eagles, seagulls, canaries, etc. Every year I go with my family to the wildlife photography exhibition at the Natural History Museum and marvel at the pictures, amazed by the skill, technique and patience needed to create such beautiful images. Did it make me want to do similar? Not really, sport was my thing and I was happy with that.But these little birds kept grabbing my attention. We soon realised a nest was being built in the rose bush growing beside our front door. I had no idea what these birds were called, needing an uncle to identify them as long-tailed tits, Britain’s lightest bird and known as bum barrels. “You lucky things!” he said. These two were near-identical cute fluffballs with mainly black and white plumage tinged with bits of grey and pink. Only later, under close inspection of the photos, did I realise one had an orange eyeball, the other had yellow. They went everywhere together I read that long-tailed tits often went round in large groups as an extended family but these two were by themselves. I decided I might as well follow them, seeing if I could get a decent frame or two. This was my chance to be a bird photographer, at least for a while.At first it was really frustrating – I would see them on a branch but before I could focus they were off. They were so quick and seemed nervous of me. As for getting them in mid-air, their undulating and erratic flight seemed impossible to capture. I needed another approach: rather than chasing them around, I realised I had to be in place first and let them come to me. I began to learn their patterns of behaviour, noting routes they flew and places they visited. It reminded me of an approach I use in sports photography, getting to know “the hot zones”, areas where most action happens and the chance of success is greater. With these birds it tended to be near the rose bush, as they would always return there for nest building.To improve my chances of a better picture, I researched the birds expanding my knowledge of them could help me work out what they were doing. As I learned more about the birds I got closer to them. I started to get some half-decent images but all were of them sitting neatly on a branch or bush. I needed something a little more exciting and challenging, to show their character. Luckily for me they decided to provide exactly what I needed.For about three weeks during their nest building they would have sudden mood changes. Most of the time, when perched, they looked calm and cute, but then, out of the blue, they would become aggressive. They began flying into my front windows, repeatedly hitting the glass. I’d never seen anything like this before and no other birds were doing it. I guessed they must have been confused by the reflections off the glass, attacking the mirror image of themselves, thinking it was a rival bird threatening their new nest. I know it might sound a little cruel but I found it fascinating – and not bad for pictures.This behaviour could happen at any time during the day. We could be watching television when there would be a tap, tap, tap on the window – the angry birds. Sitting in my armchair I’d have a perfect view of the TV and the front window. There could be someone having their arm ripped off on the show Tiger King but my gaze was fixed elsewhere.Some days were much quieter. I’d be sitting, poised with camera, waiting for the birds, but nothing. That didn’t seem too bad if I was inside but I would also sit outside, tucked away behind my bins in a basic attempt to disguise myself, getting some very strange looks from passersby, obviously questioning my mental wellbeing. The hours would pass, time enough for me to wonder myself about my own sanity, then suddenly there would be a flurry of action. It reminded me of being at a cricket match, waiting ages for something to happen, then boom, drama all over in a flash.The birds seemed to have their favourite spots. Stretching across the street are a couple of old telephone wires, which they loved sitting on and bouncing in between. It gave them a perfect view down to the nest below and no other bird used them. It was part playground, part lookout, part bathroom and all theirs. Frequently, as the last rays of the setting sun hit the wires, the birds would wash themselves and dry off there.Looking at the nest it was easy to see why the long-tailed tit has been called the structural engineer of the bird world. These two put together an amazing rugby-ball shaped construction with a small entrance hole about three-quarters of the way up. It was built from hair, moss, cobwebs and lichen but, most ingeniously of all, with silk from spider cocoons which made the nest elastic and stretchy, so when it was full of growing chicks it could expand with them. Once the outside was made the two birds set about finding a stash of feathers – up to 2,000 can be used – to line the inside, making it soft for the eggs to be laid.When the nest was done the constant flying ceased. I presumed the eggs were laid as one bird would often stay behind, probably incubating, while the other found food. We loved it when we could see the bird’s head poking out of the nest entrance, watching the world go by. This pattern continued for quite a few days until I sensed something else was happening. I saw one of the birds with food in its mouth heading into the rose bush – a sure sign. Perched on top of a ladder I found a great view, in between branches straight through to the nest entrance which had a large pigeon feather pulled across, shielding the contents inside. The parent completely ignored me and poked its head inside – a tiny beak appeared.From then on, growth for the chicks was rapid, fuelled by the endless food shuttles the parents were doing. Backwards and forwards they flew, laden with various insects and grubs. The chicks quickly lost their reptilian looks, gaining feathers and fluffing up. The distinctive white line of the long-tailed tit was on their heads, like they had tiny Mohican haircuts. It may be a stereotypical scene, seen countless times on television, thrusting beaks of egg-yolk yellow, eager to grab food from a parent, but it still gave me goosebumps witnessing it right there in front of me.The chicks would desperately try to force themselves forward to the very edge of the entrance hole, hoping to be first in line for grub. This jostling of positions would often end up in squabbling and bickering – it struck a familiar chord with me. In between the regular feeds they would sleep, some with necks hanging right out of the nest, not wanting to lose their hard-earned priority position.Unsure of exactly when the first chicks were born, I had to guess the day they might start leaving the nest. Fledging time was approaching. One day I looked out and saw the first chick had ventured from the nest and on to surrounding branches. After about 20 minutes of washing itself and wobbling around, very unsure on its feet, it decided that was enough and headed back inside the nest. The next day I went out very early. Looking down to the ground I saw two chicks had tumbled eight feet from the nest down to the concrete paving.One was already dead, the other looked battered, shaken and groggy – a heartbreaking sight. We scooped up the injured one in a tiny bowl and placed it back in the rose bush. It was ignored by both parents – the question was, did these two chicks fall or were they pushed? Perhaps the nest got overloaded and they were forced out? I also started to think about my role. Should I be trying to save this chick? Was I interfering with nature? It’s obviously a frequent dilemma faced by many recording the natural world. The injured and scorned one fell out of the rose bush another couple of times, and each time we scooped it up and placed it back. After the fourth fall we had to make the decision to leave it to die. I was gutted. Another chick emerged from the nest and briefly wobbled around. Whether or not it saw its sibling lying on the paving below I can’t be sure, but it soon decided freedom was overrated and returned inside.The next morning, while eating breakfast, I heard a commotion from the nest, one much louder than the usual arguments. Going out I couldn’t believe it – the sweetest chicks you could ever imagine emerging from the nest and perched in the branches of the rose bush, seven in total. A mass wash and unfurling of feathers was happening, the chattering noise incredible. Gradually they found their balance and bravery, wandering around before, one by one, they summoned up the courage to take their maiden flights, in this case around three feet over to the privet hedge. Some just about made it some fell short, landing on a dustbin, window box or dwarf Christmas tree. One landed on my camera. Somehow they all managed to meet up in the privet hedge, where they began to mimic being back in the nest, squeezing together in a bundle of fluff and feather.That first night out they went to sleep, seven in a row, packed tightly on a branch in the privet hedge. But the next morning, they had gone. I looked for ominous signs, like loose feathers, fearful that a cat or fox had found them. Thankfully there were none.They had flown off and my feeling of responsibility had gone with them. I stood in my back garden, all around me a cacophony of tweets and squeaks as new wings were being tested out, but not the ones I was really interested in. Occasionally I spotted one of the parent birds in among all the others, blackbirds, thrushes, wrens and wood pigeons … and robins of course. Later that evening I saw one of our chicks in a tree near our bathroom window, looking tiny, out by itself in the wide, open world. But after that sighting I saw them no more. They were definitely gone.It has been said that sport has often played a vital role at times of crisis, battles on the pitch taking the nation’s mind away from battles off it. This time, it’s clear to me that nature has stepped up to take on the role of the great distractor. Thanks to this wonderful family of tiny birds, the natural world handed me solace and respite, helping me keep my sanity during this crazy spring. Thank you my beautiful bum barrels, I’ll never forget you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a6637676260a40c3ece9e439ee8f21c01f1663d/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81de1f84be71ccb4b902e51d298fb93e","title":"buffy and bucket hats why 1997 has taken over fashion","story":"Thanks to a sudden spike in late 90s popular culture, the decade’s best looks have become the focus of a new nostalgiaViewers of Netflix’s hit series, The Last Dance, will at first be dumbstruck by the way Michael Jordan passes to himself to dunk a basketball, Dennis Rodman’s party boy reputation and the length of Scottie Pippen’s legs, which seem to stretch 3-D style into living rooms. By episode 10, though, the overriding takeaway is late-90s style: with the unstoppable force of an MJ attack, it moves from your laptop screen to your wardrobe.\u0026nbspNostalgia makes sense for now, of course – in times of crisis, familiarity brings comfort to fashion, adding reassurance when getting dressed, and providing something certain and established when almost nothing else is. With anxiety levels so high, wearing nailed-on modern classics such as slipdresses and bucket hats alleviates the stress of trying to fit into a trend or wear the right thing. Perhaps these pieces are like a good spag bol – the sartorial equivalent of comfort eating.Zeroing in on one year feels like a new spin on nostalgia. The year 1997 works because it is long enough ago to have a “Remember when?” feel, but modern enough to avoid retro tweeness. If the early seasons of Friends – those before Rachel got the Rachel and Phoebe wore lots of denim – feel dated, we recognise the cast in 1997’s season four, the one where Ross doesn’t marry Emily. Princess Diana died in 1997 and has become a style icon for Gen Z. Gianni Versace died, too, and still influences the style of young women such as Kylie Jenner, who was, yes, born in 1997.Films from the year feel as if they could influence your wardrobe rather than your costume-party look. The outfits worn by Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino in Romy \u0026amp Michele’s High School Reunion would be snapped up on Depop. Boogie Nights nailed the whole 90s-does-the-70s thing, and feels quite Celine SS20. And Bridget Fonda’s surfer combo of bikini top and denim cut-offs in Jackie Brown is the aim of my social-distancing-while-sunbathing-in-the-park look this summer.\u0026nbspCatwalk fashion was big in 1997, but it was also a year when today’s major players began to move into position. Tom Ford was in his pomp at Gucci, all oiled-up bodies and G-branded g-strings. Kate Moss walked on water wearing bumsters for Alexander McQueen. Marc Jacobs – only four years away from dismissal at Perry Ellis for a grunge collection – was appointed creative director at Louis Vuitton. Victoria Adams started to date David Beckham, and to dress a little differently to her fellow Spice Girls. Acne Studios was founded in Stockholm.With 90s style now everywhere from high street brands to Instagram accounts, a focus on 1997 feels both gloriously niche and a bit of a hack – a Kondo-ing of the broader retro references, if you will. It’s finite: a bite-sized nugget of comfort, where an endless refreshed feed of retro cool can be exhausting. It’s manageable. And, right now, manageable feels good.\u0026nbsp• This article was amended on 17 June 2020 because an earlier version referred in the text and in a picture caption to Kerry Washington’s character in Little Fires Everywhere wearing “hip-huggers” whereas she was wearing high rise jeans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9724099ae63347116a702312830beaca12b277d/0_30_3504_2104/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=533d749ee29abd485d68937d6143642a","title":"ive never seen schindlers list","story":"Spielberg’s beautifully shot three-hour multi-Oscar-winner is at times overwrought, but fully worthy of its masterpiece statusThere’s a game that off-duty film critics play. Usually at a film festival, after a hard day toiling at the coal-face of arthouse cinema always after alcohol. Someone will suggest another bottle of wine and a round of Embarrassing Omissions. Essentially the premise is the same as that of this column – people take turns to admit their personal gaps in the cinema canon – but with added professional humiliation.It sounds innocuous enough. Just harmless banter with colleagues, right? Well sure, until it’s your turn and you are expected to own up to the most mortifying gap in your knowledge, baring your inadequacies in front of a group of peers and, inevitably, being judged for it. The trick to the game is to never, ever admit the\u0026nbspactual\u0026nbspmost embarrassing omission, while also giving just enough ground to ensure you don’t get challenged for ducking out of your turn. It’s a fine balance. A bit like playing chicken, but rather than dodging juggernauts on a dual carriageway, you risk crushing shame and a thundering case of imposter syndrome. Get it right and you can still just about hold your head high get it wrong – like the newby critic who confessed to never having watched\u0026nbspTaxi Driver\u0026nbsp– and there’s a palpable chill in the air, a sharp intake of breath from the assembled cineastes who have, apparently, seen every important film ever made except for some second tier neo-realist gem that you’ve never even heard of.My go-to cover story used to be the fact that, despite several attempts, I hadn’t watched Terry Gilliam’s\u0026nbspBrazil\u0026nbspin its entirety, having fallen asleep every time. The flesh was willing, but the brain shut down, repeatedly. I would never, however, have owned up to the really big gaps in my viewing. Certainly not the fact that I hadn’t watched Steven Spielberg’s multi-Oscar-winning acknowledged masterpiece,\u0026nbspSchindler’s List.How can it be, even as I dedicated a fair amount of time and effort to polyfilla the cracks in my film knowledge, that I never watched\u0026nbspSchindler’s List? Partly, I think, it’s to do with the fact it’s easily available. It would always be there, once I finally got around to it. There was always something more urgent – a season of little-seen marvels from a rediscovered genius the one and only chance to catch that elusive second tier neo-realist gem. That, and the fact that it’s more than three hours long.So here we are. I have the opportunity, not just to confess, but to atone. It’s certainly a change of pace for me. My lockdown movie flavour of choice has been rather more brash and lurid: lots of De Palma, mixed up with a fair few martial arts movies. I approach the film with the hope that it will live up to the near universal praise, and the fear that, like so many of Spielberg’s films, it will tip over into melodrama.In some ways both are realised. I am struck, immediately, by how beautiful it is. Shot by Janusz Kamiński in limpid black and white, the film has an almost expressionistic quality, using blades of light to carve up the image and to ennoble Liam Neeson’s already chiselled profile. The gorgeous photography doesn’t exactly mitigate the mounting horror but it’s gentler on the soul than something more immersive and immediate, like the Hungarian Holocaust picture\u0026nbspSon of Saul, or indeed the first 20 minutes of\u0026nbspSaving Private Ryan. But while arresting beauty acts almost like a protective carapace between the audience and the evils of the Nazis, I am less keen on the jarring use of colour – the scene with the child in the red coat who catches Oskar Schindler’s attention jolted me out of the film and into the filmmaking.But on balance, there was much I loved. The use of space – moments of silence and contemplation pauses in the dialogue which say as much as words do. The score, with that klezmer-infused version of Gloomy Sunday which drenches the whole film in melancholy and foreboding. And Ralph Fiennes’ remarkable performance as camp commandant Amon Goeth, with his petulant ennui and cosseted cruelty.And yes, there are moments when the approach becomes a little overwrought – Schindler’s tortured self-recrimination, for example. But that didn’t grate on me as much as it normally would. Perhaps, with nerves frayed by months uncertainty and home-schooling, a big cathartic old sob-fest was exactly what I needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/937e48fd458fc0e53543d612cdacf319fe434ad7/0_158_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=530465b8af954bc7526838bd4650c3ba","title":"food live animal markets new york coronavirus","story":"Amid the coronavirus, calls have grown to ban the erse US markets that stock and slaughter live animals. But is that wise? John Harry was in the mood for chicken curry, so he walked two blocks from home to pick out a couple of birds.His destination was a squat warehouse surrounded by auto body shops, a scrapyard, and a school bus depot in the working-class neighborhood of Richmond Hill in Queens, New York. Inside was riotously loud, with the cries of chickens, duck, quail, guinea fowl and the tender pigeons known as squab, jostling for space and pecking seed in tall metal cages. In another room was a pen with lambs and goats butting heads and chewing alfalfa.The warehouse smelled powerfully of feathers and droppings, but Harry, a Guyanese construction worker in his 50s, seemed unfazed. He pointed out two broiler hens to a man in overalls who grabbed them, hung them by their legs from a scale, then carried them into a room strewn with feathers and drew a knife across their throats.“You can put your rice to boil, come get a chicken, be home before it burns,” Harry said. “Can’t get fresher than this.”The market he frequents, Madani Halal, is one of more than 80 in New York City that stock live animals and slaughter them on demand for customers. The markets are considered vitally important in many immigrant communities for cultural, religious or health reasons, contributing to the erse culinary landscape for which New York is famous. Since the 1990s the number of markets has nearly doubled, concentrated mostly in outer-borough immigrant neighborhoods. But since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have spread from a live animal market in China, a group of New York lawmakers has sought to shut these markets down, fearing that they pose a disease threat.Bills currently before the New York assembly and senate have requested an immediate moratorium on all live animal markets in the city. If passed, they would see the markets closed until a proposed new taskforce investigates concerns about public health and animal welfare in the sector.But critics of this plan, including researchers and community activists, say it unfairly targets immigrants, and is unlikely to reduce the risk of disease. They argue that it blurs issues of health and animal rights while overlooking the wider harms of industrial meat production.“This isn’t about food safety,” said Richard David, an activist from south Queens, home to a large number of the city’s live markets. “This is about food justice.”Some so-called “wet markets” in Asia, named for the common practice of hosing them down with water, stock exotic wildlife alongside live animals, providing a potential nexus for diseases to spread. This has led to growing calls around the world to ban them, even though the precise history of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, is still unclear.But the term “wet markets” has become confusing in the process, mixing up wildlife consumption with less exotic traditions, such as the poultry markets of New York. This has led to a situation where, in the rush to create a safer food system, culturally significant food practices, which pose comparatively minor public health risks, are coming under threat.In New York, animal rights groups have begun campaigning vigorously on issues of food safety, including staging protests outside markets. A recent petition by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) urges officials to shut down “blood-soaked slaughterhouses” in New York, specifically referring to the facilities as “wet markets” in an accompanying video. Peta has also urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to denounce live animal markets globally. The WHO has resisted these demands, saying that live markets provide food and jobs for millions of people.“Nobody is in favor of unsanitary markets,” said Nevin Cohen, a professor of public health at the Cuny Urban Food Policy Institute. “But instead of the kneejerk reaction of shutting them down, there are other policy tools, such as updating regulations or increasing enforcement.”These could include more frequent inspections and harsher penalties for non-compliance, he explained. “Banning these markets would eliminate some of the cultural ersity of our food system,” Cohen added. “It potentially sanitizes the city, in a bad way.”On a recent weekday morning, Awadh Radhakrishen, a parking garage attendant from Guyana, waited outside Madani Halal for his order. “You see everything here,” he told me. “You know what you’re eating.” But with supermarket chicken there was no way of telling, he said. “It might have been killed two weeks ago, two states away.”Live markets were a fundamental facet of New York’s culinary landscape until the rise of refrigeration in the 20th century. Modern supply chains physically distanced consumers from producers, increasingly shielding them from what the American food writer Michael Pollan has called “the shame of killing”. For this and other reasons, such as urbanization and rising incomes, meat consumption increased massively. At the same time, the harms of meat production multiplied, from toxic runoff at feedlots to the slaughterhouses that have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots, predominantly for low-paid immigrants and people of color.While that supply chain remains largely invisible, establishments like Madani Halal are wide open to public scrutiny. “It’s easier to pick on the little guy,” said Imran Uddin, the market’s owner.A big man with a full beard, Uddin left a career in advertising 20 years ago to take over the business from his father, a Bengali immigrant who began selling poultry in 1996. Uddin’s customers come from far and wide: the Caribbean, Latin America, China, south-east Asia. There are Punjabi Sikhs who buy and slaughter their own chickens, observing religious custom, and old Italian men from a different era in the neighborhood, when it was home mostly to European immigrants. “I see fewer of them each year,” Uddin said.Like all New York live markets, Madani Halal is licensed by the state department of agriculture and markets, subject to random inspections – of the animals and facilities – about once a month. Yet Uddin says he is in favor of even stricter regulation, conceding that some markets “cut corners”.According to the bill before the New York senate, inspectors have issued “a litany of violations” at live animal markets, including sidewalks with blood and feces and “allowing grime to accumulate on butchering equipment”.“Many of these markets can and should be improved,” said Krishnendu Ray, an associate professor of food studies at New York University. “But calls to eliminate them serve only to invoke disgust against the small practices of small people – while leaving intact the very large systems that are threats to health, animal welfare and the environment.”While organizations like Peta also campaign against industrial meat production, those corporations are vastly more powerful and less sensitive to activism.“If the alternative to these markets is mass-produced meat, we’re talking about displacing risk elsewhere, not reducing it,” said Cohen.Uddin recently drafted a petition for his customers, placing it on a clipboard at the cashier’s window. It reads: “I implore our representatives to reconsider the support for this new bill and empathize with the different cultural, ethnic and religious communities you represent.”So far, a few hundred people have signed, he said. Other customers had declined, wary of drawing attention to their immigration status. The petition by Peta has nearly 50,000 signatures. “People fear what they don’t know,” Uddin said.Uddin got into his truck and drove across the neighborhood with a delivery. Gousul Anwar, a Bangladeshi man who runs a dollar store in Manhattan’s Chinatown, was at home due to the pandemic he came to the door barefoot and in a shirt that read “Don’t panic”. He’d been buying meat from Uddin for more than 15 years, he said – and before that, from Uddin’s father. So had Anwar’s cousin, a slender man with a long beard who was sitting outside his apartment across the street. He waved and greeted Uddin warmly in Bengali. Both cousins were growing potted plants – tomatoes, peppers – fertilized with manure from Madani Halal.With only minor modifications, the scene resembled a kind of farm-to-table fantasy: the owner of a family business, delivering food and organic waste to customers he knew personally, providing a functioning, affordable alternative to the industrial meat system. Except in this case the participants weren’t virtuous middle-class shoppers, but working immigrants – “the fabric of New York”, Uddin called them afterwards.“They’ve left behind friends and family,” he said. “They work multiple jobs – the jobs Americans don’t want. And at the end of the day they want something that reminds them of home.“Those people are my customers,” he went on. “It disturbs me that people want to take this away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2df4f36cbc3c335dabe1bdb8a7a36f433a3e428/0_356_5044_3026/master/5044.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b07a7a316c48205fe20429535932dc","title":"how to make the perfect knickerbocker glory recipe felicity cloake","story":"Layer upon layer of ridiculous ice-cream decadence: is it even possible to make the definitive knickerbocker glory?An appropriately magnificent name for the king of ice-cream sundaes – almost 70 years on, my dad still hasn’t got over the fact that he was never allowed one on his annual childhood trip to the seaside. Too dear, at 26d, for little boys, apparently. Every time we go into Morelli’s, still going strong in all its 1950s splendour on Broadstairs seafront, he looks wistfully at the menu before ordering a coffee, yet when we finally treated him, he had to give up after two mouthfuls. Which is why you should indulge yourself now – there’s never been a better time.Oddly enough, though the knickerbocker glory is now thought of as a very British treat, it seems to have its origins in the United States, spiritual home of the sundae (where it was, according to historian Janet Clarkson, probably created as a response to strict Sabbath trading laws): the first record seems to be in a 1915 handbook for soda fountain proprietors. The name wouldn’t have seemed so wonderfully strange over there, Knickerbocker being the Dutch-American hero of Washington Irving’s 1809 A History of New York, who, in turn, lent his name to knee breeches Clarkson suggests the link might be the socks worn below these garments, which makes sense, because the knickerbocker glory’s defining feature is its colourful layers, striped with promise.That said, the knickerbocker glory was certainly here and flourishing by the late 1920s, and almost a century on it’s still delighting adults and children alike – one H Potter enjoys just such a sundae in his first literary outing, albeit one already rejected by Dudley Dursley for insufficient ice-cream. If anything, it’s a mood, rather than a recipe – as food writer Mark Diacono notes, “I’ve probably not made two the same.” That said, here are a few ideas to get you started.Food writer Tim Hayward, meanwhile, who is icily dismissive of those suggesting you “let your imagination run riot” with a knickerbocker glory, allows that ice-cream is the one place there is scope for variation. If your childhood holidays were “like the covers of Ladybird books … you can ladle in curls of thick, churned West Country ice-cream from a sustainable cardboard tub with a picture of a cottage on it”, he writes in the Financial Times. If, however, “your holidays involved a coach, sick, a caravan and an aunt with a beehive who smoked menthol cigarettes, then just hose in the soft-serve. Either is authentic.”Though, times being as they are, I’m not able to run out and stop the van to buy one, I do find a recipe from chef Tristan Welch of Parker’s Taveren in Cambridge that gets as close to the original as possible without a machine to aerate the stuff, using glucose and gelatine to recreate its “gluey stretchiness” before whizzing it in a blender to give a perfectly smooth finish. It’s utterly wonderful stuff, if you have the time, but for me a knickerbocker glory doesn’t demand Mr Whippy. Mind you, as Hayward notes, this is a very personal thing, so I’m going to leave the final choice of ice-cream between you and your freezer. Personally, I reckon a scoop of chocolate and a scoop of vanilla do the job just fine.Hayward is less understanding here: “It is absolutely vital that you don’t become distracted by modern notions of freshness – it’s all very well banging on about gorgeous organic native strawberries, but they wouldn’t have lasted eight seconds under the counter in high season.” Instead, he demands that “postwar favourite”, tinned fruit cocktail: “The true secret of the knickerbocker glory, the cubes of tinned peach, the dodgy little blocks of tinned pear and the single, unbearably gorgeous grape that came in each can.” A can proves surprisingly hard to come by (an unlikely victim of stockpiling, perhaps?), but when I do eventually track some down, it’s pure nostalgia.Fancy fresh fruit is undeniably more popular, however – even in 1915, they ran to raspberry puree. The Weirs use raspberry and crushed pineapple, Fortnum’s diced strawberries and pineapple, Hix sliced strawberries, Ottolenghi and Goh red plums (Goh tells me they “make all the difference in the eating of this”), while Mary Berry suggests mango and blueberry. You can use almost anything you like, but I think the flamboyance of a knickerbocker glory demands something more exotic than British berries, great as they are, or indeed tinned fruit. So I’m going for the ritziness of pineapple and, because a knickerbocker glory is almost as much about visual effect as it is flavour, green grapes. I would, however, urge you to keep the maraschino cherry at the bottom (and top) of the glass: like the seed in the middle of an aniseed ball, chasing it around the glass is a good way to dull the disappointment of finishing the thing.There’s another reason that I’ve avoided the classic red fruits of British summertime though the American recipe calls for chocolate syrup (leading me to this easy and stupidly tasty recipe, which I highly commend to you and which is so good I’ve included it as an option below), British knickerbocker glories tend to prefer a generic, red-flavour version sometimes known as Melba syrup, suggesting it has raspberries somewhere in its ancestry, though the young Hayward knew it as “monkey’s blood”. You could make something similar, if less lurid, from watered-down and sieved raspberry jam, as he suggests, or indeed any jam you like (marmalade might be nice), but the fresh version in Ottolenghi and Goh’s recipe, echoed in the recipe in Tom Parker Bowles’ Fortnum’s Cookbook, is almost as easy, and irresistible in its tangy sweetness.Whatever sauce you choose, ide it between the layers pouring it from the top, as in Hayward’s memory, will provide insufficient coverage – in fact, the same goes for the fruit in general. Pooling it all at the bottom makes for a disappointing ending, unless you get as excited about fruit as you do about ice-cream, which I must confess I do not.Whipped cream is a must, popping up in every recipe except for Hix’s, which adds clotted cream instead. Here, I think the latter is too dense and buttery – clouds of airy chantilly offer more contrast to the chilly solidity of the ice-cream below. Fortnum’s tops its showstopper of a sundae with Italian meringue, blowtorched until just golden, which is a great idea if you’re looking to stop traffic with your sundae, though as this is the kind of thing you might like to whip up on a hot afternoon, and meringues are undeniably a bit of a sticky faff to make, I’m going to stick with lightly sweetened cream.A sundae is a symphony of textures as well as flavours, which is why something crunchy is required in among all that soft fruit and rich dairy – Hayward recalls hundreds and thousands and a wafer being the crowning glory of his childhood memories, though he concedes flaked nuts were available “for the posh”. Some recipes, such as Berry’s, use these simply chopped (pistachios, in her case), some caramelise them first, like Hix, while Ottolenghi and Goh make an addictively delicious pecan brittle, which is well worth 15 minutes of your time.Finish with a wafer, a meringue stick, a long spoon or, my own favourite, a chocolate flake reminiscent of the very British ’99. Devour immediately, without pausing to take a breath.For the almond brittle1 tbsp golden syrup2 tsp sugar⅛ tsp flaky salt50g flaked almondsFor the raspberry sauce…200g raspberries2 tsp icing sugar… or for the chocolate sauce60g cocoa powder100g sugar¼ tsp flaky saltTo finish200ml whipping or double cream1 tbsp icing sugar1 tsp vanilla extract4 maraschino or fresh cherries200g chopped fruit of your choice – I like pineapple and green grapes6 scoops ice-cream of your choice – I like a mixture of vanilla and chocolate2 chocolate flakes or wafersStart by making the almond brittle. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 and line a baking tray. Gently heat the golden syrup, sugar and salt in a small pan until melted, then add the almonds and stir to coat. Spread out on the prepared tray, bake for six to eight minutes, until golden brown, then remove, leave to cool and harden, then roughly chop.To make the raspberry sauce, whizz the raspberries to a puree, then pass through a sieve to catch the seeds, and stir in the sugar to taste.If making the chocolate sauce instead, put the sugar in a small pan with 250ml water and bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Whisk in the cocoa and salt, and continue to cook, stirring, until thickened, then leave to cool.Whip the cream in a large bowl until it just holds its shape, then whisk in the sugar and vanilla.To assemble the dish, put a cherry in the base of a tall glass and top with a spoonful of fruit, followed by a scoop of ice-cream and a spoonful of your chosen sauce.Sprinkle over a few of the nuts, and repeat these layers, this time omitting the cherry, twice more. Top with a dollop of cream and more nuts, add the flake and a second cherry, and eat immediately.• The knickerbocker glory: a fond memory, or something best left in the past, riding on the coat tails of an undeniably fantastic name?

The decoration is an optional extra, but makes these a fun treat to serve to friends and family.For the creme brulee3 medium egg yolks25g sugar (adjust this to taste) plus 4-8tsp extra to sprinkle on top to caramelise (you can use granulated, caster or demerara sugar)500g double cream100g whole milk (replace with double cream for a richer custard)1tbsp vanilla bean paste or two vanilla podsFor the sugar shards50g liquid glucoseGel food dyesFor the fondant decorationRed fondantEdible sprinkle eyes (or white and black fondant)You will need four 12cm diameter ovenproof ramekins.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas mark 4. Place the ramekins into a baking tray with high sides.Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until combined. Add the double cream, milk and vanilla to a pan, then stir occasionally over a medium heat until just starting to bubble. Gradually pour this over the egg and sugar mixture, whisking constantly as you pour.Ladle the mixture evenly between the four ramekins. You can use a spoon to scoop off the bubbles for a smoother appearance after baking, although this isn’t necessary. Fill the baking tray with warm water, until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the ramekins (don’t get water inside).Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the creme brulee has a slight wobble in the centre.Carefully take the ramekins out from the hot water using an oven glove, or wait for the water to cool a little before removing. Place in the fridge to chill – six hours to overnight is ideal, but you can get away with less.Meanwhile, make the sugar shards. Reduce the oven temperature to 170C (150C fan)325Fgas mark 3. Squeeze liquid glucose shapes on to baking paper and spread out using a spoon. Place small blobs of food dye on to the shapes (a little goes a long way).

We know that eating porridge every morning could make you healthier and even extend your life, although I would have to subtract all the time I spent eating porridge before I decided it was worth it. But porridge is by no means the beginning and the end of oats. Here are 17 different ways to use them, and only one of them is a traditional porridge. Feel free to skip it.First, some technical information: oats come in a bewildering variety of formats – whole, rolled, quick, instant, jumbo, steel-cut, pinhead, oatmeal, gluten-free – but a little simplification is helpful. Steel-cut and pinhead oats are the same thing: the hulled oat groat, chopped into two or three pieces. Rolled oats have been steamed and flattened quick oats have been either steamed longer or pressed flatter, or both. Jumbo oats are big rolled oats. Anything called porridge oats may well have been steel cut and then rolled. Oatmeal is made from oats ground to various grades. Oats themselves contain no gluten, but unless they are certified and labelled as “gluten-free” they may have been contaminated by wheat or other grains, either in the field or during processing.Most of the following recipes call for either rolled oats, porridge oats (ie, fragmented rolled oats) or oatmeal, all of which are soft enough to have wider baking applications. That said, Felicity Cloake’s formula for perfect porridge uses equal amounts of pinhead and medium oatmeal. But let’s leave the debate about what constitutes a traditional breakfast porridge behind, in pursuit of things that definitely don’t.Porridge isn’t the only breakfast you can make with oats. The Pinch of Nom duo Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson have a simple recipe for oat pancakes, a lighter, healthier alternative to the regular sort. They recommend using Ready Brek – which is a mixture of rolled oats and oat flour – but they say you can just whizz up some rolled oats in a food processor to make them a bit finer.Tom Hunt’s frugal oat pancakes make use of leftover porridge, with the addition of regular flour. Nigella Lawson’s oat pancakes with raspberries and honey provide a more decadent option.David Atherton’s blueberry baked oatmeal is a sort of packed lunch porridge in muffin form, while Sally McKenney’s more traditional take on muffins uses more flour than oats. In my experience, frozen blueberries work very well for muffins, to the extent that they are generally preferable to fresh.For something more savoury try pikelets, which, depending on your perspective, are either small, plump pancakes or very thin crumpets. They contain yeast, so the oats and flour may need to soak and prove overnight. Dan Lepard’s parsley pikelets deserve a corner on any full English breakfast plate.You can make your own granola by mixing rolled oats with a combination of nuts, seeds, dried fruit, oil and maple syrup or honey, as explained in this recipe from Cookie \u0026amp Kate. Press the mixture flat into a baking tray and bake until you end up with nuggets of crunchy oaten ore. Cookie is a dog, by the way.If that’s too elaborate, Jack Monroe has a much simpler, no-frills version using peanut butter, which will keep in a sealed container for about a month.For a dairy-free breakfast eat your oat granola with oat milk. If you have ever wondered about the mysterious process by which oats are turned into milk, you can experiment with producing it yourself. Being unschooled in the world of non-dairy milks, I was expecting some kind of alchemy requiring specialist equipment, but the process is both eerily straightforward and incredibly cheap compared with shop-bought oat milk – about 11p for 750ml.Oats make an excellent coating for fried food, in place of flour, breadcrumbs or cornmeal. They work a treat in this cheat’s chicken katsu curry, so I’m presuming they would work just as well in a more honest katsu curry. They can also be used to coat fish to fry for fish tacos.A number of savoury porridge recipes exist. One of the best known, at least by name, is Heston Blumenthal’s snail porridge. It’s a bit involved and perhaps not to everyone’s taste, but if you happen to have them lying around, it’s a great way to use up 72 snails. Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s savoury porridge with kale and bacon probably has wider appeal, and Yotam Ottolenghi’s savoury porridge combines eggs, oats, garlic and ginger.Flapjacks may be the most likely avenue for people with oats and time on their hands, but Nigel Slater’s mum’s recipe is a cut above, featuring pistachios and dried fruit.Cranachan is a traditional Scottish dessert combining the four basic Scottish food groups: oats, raspberries, whisky and cream, although Mary Berry’s take has a very untraditional addition: mascarpone.If it’s tradition you’re after, the Anzac biscuit has great historic significance in Australia and New Zealand. The story is cloudy – they were allegedly baked to send to overseas soldiers during the first world war, but the recipe didn’t emerge until about 1920. It’s pretty much a shallow, round flapjack with the addition of desiccated coconut. The chewier version here is simple and fairly foolproof – although I can’t tell you how authentic it is because I had never tasted one before. They do have something a man of a certain age likes in a biscuit: the whiff of privation. At first, my sons regarded them as some kind of punishment, but the plate was empty by morning.I can’t imagine what the teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in the recipe is for – the biscuits come out of the oven flatter than they went in. But you can’t skip it: Australia’s department of veterans’ affairs maintains strict legal control over the use of the word “Anzac”, and makes exceptions for the biscuit only when the traditional recipe is adhered to. For God’s sake, do not experiment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7e9319e0ea2aa8e8c51cca0bb0caf3ee91fdd26/0_3_3283_1969/master/3283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=025035d15283cc7546f18f4ef1ef1e9e","title":"manchester city v arsenal premier league live","story":"A shambolic performance from the Arsenal substitute David Luiz gave Manchester City a comfortable victory on their return to action“Breaking News!” writes Gary Naylor. “With Arsenal away at the Amex on Saturday, they have decided not to appeal David Luiz’s red card. But Brighton have.”Jamie Jackson’s match report has arrived, so I’ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company, goodnight.ICYMI, here’s what happened earlier.The game ended with a worrying injury to City’s teenage centre-back Eric Garcia, who was stretchered off after being flattened by Ederson. There’s no more news on him at the moment.Peep peep! Manchester City complete a comfortable win over Arsenal. The government hoped the return of the Premier League might lift the nation’s morale, and David Luiz obliged with a slapstick cameo for the ages. After coming on as substitute he made the first two City goals in his own inimitable style.Luiz set up Raheem Sterling’s opening goal after suddenly forgetting how to control his own legs, and secured victory for City by giving away a penalty and getting sent off just after half-time.90+8 min Almost a consolation goal for Arsenal. After excellent play from Nelson, Aubameyang’s close-range shot deflects wide off the ever diligent Gundogan.90+6 min And now Aguero misses an even better chance, driving into the side netting after a good through pass from Foden.90+5 min Bernardo Silva misses a good chance, spraying well wide from the edge of the area.90+4 min The upshot of this result is that Liverpool can’t win the title at Goodison Park on Sunday. They should now seal it at home to Crystal Palace next week.Phil Foden seals a thumping win for City. It was a brilliant move, started by a stunning, flat crossfield pass from Fernandinho to Walker. Aguero and Sterling then sliced the Arsenal defence open with a lovely give-and-go. Aguero’s shot hit the post via the legs of Leno, and Foden gobbled up the rebound.090 min There will be 11 added minutes.88 min Garcia is finally moved onto the bigger stretcher and moved carefully from the field. City have used all five subs so they are down to 10 men as well.86 min Ederson is leaning over Garcia to check if he is okay. At first he stayed away, whether because of fear, shock or whatever. Garcia still hasn’t been moved onto the bigger of the two stretchers. And though the players look relatively calm, this is all pretty worrying. He has been down for six or seven minutes now.85 min Garcia is still being treated. The players don’t look unduly worried - Ederson and Aguero are joking about something while Mendy and Lacazette are having a conversation with their shirts pulled over their faces. I’m sure Garcia is concussed beyond that we don’t know.83 min Ederson charged out of his area to head a long ball clear, and accidentally followed through to flatten Garcia. It was not unlike the infamous SchumacherBattiston incident in 1982. Garcia is still down receiving treatment, and is about to be moved onto a stretcher. I think he’s in a neck brace. 80 min Ederson has accidentally flattened one of his team-mates, who is on his back and surrounded by concerned players on both sides. I’m not sure who it is but there are a lot of medical staff around him.80 min City’s final substitution. Sergio Aguero replaces Gabriel Jesus, so Leroy Sane will have to wait for his return to the first team.79 min Rodri is booked for an old normal tactical foul.79 min The reason Gundogan was in so much space for that chance was that Rodri blocked an Arsenal player, Maitland-Niles I think, so it would probably have been disallowed by VAR had City scored.78 min “To confirm the actual best word ever, may I present ultracrepidarian?” says Lenny. “Ultracrepidarianism is the habit of giving opinions and advice on matters outside of one’s knowledge. No better description of a football fan exists.”77 min: Another good save from Leno! City had a free-kick 30 yards from goal after that Tierney foul. Sterling shaped to shoot and then played into Gundogan in space on the right side of the area. He took a touch and sidefooted a shot that was palmed away at the near post by Leno. He’s been excellent.76 min Tierney is booked for a poor tackle on Gundogan.73 min “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “So football is back, and already it feels as if it’s never been away. VAR controversy, and Arsenal being Arsenal. Some things don’t need complicated language. Football is as football does.”70 min More City changes. Rodri and Fernandinho replace Aymeric Laporte and the wonderful Kevin De Bruyne.69 min Gorgeous play from City. Gundogan waves a pass out to Sterling on the right side of the area. He waits for the ball to bounce and then flicks it through to the onrushing De Bruyne, whose shot is pushed behind by Leno.68 min “Good evening Rob,” says Duncan Lennox. “Do you think these audio crowds can do a Mexican.wav? Sorry.”You’ll get plenty of Free Lossless Audio Codec for that pun. 67 min Arsenal make their last block of substitutions. Alexandre Lacazette, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Reiss Nelson replace Guendouzi, Willock and Nketiah.65 min A couple of changes for City: Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden replace David Silva and Riyad Mahrez.65 min David Silva plays a fine through pass to Walker, whose low cross is well claimed by Leno. After a difficult start, this has turned into a very rewarding net session for City.62 min Arsenal have barely had a kick in the last five minutes. 60 min “Can we go back to not having football please?” writes59 min Jesus blooters the ball straight at Leno from 25 yards. It was a fierce strike but too close to the keeper.58 min Tierney is now playing at centre-half alongside Mustafi, who is back on the field.57 min “So Arsenal could be down to no centre-halves,” says Tracy Mohr, referring to my comment after Mustafi’s injury. “How will we know the difference?”56 min Arsenal played very well for half an hour, but now they are facing yet another heavy defeat to City.54 min Mustafi is now struggling after that Sterling tackle, so Arsenal could be down to no centre-halves. They have three more substitutions but only one remaining block of substitutions under the new rules.52 min Mustafi is down after a lunge from Sterling. It wasn’t a great tackle, and he probably should have been booked.De Bruyne scores with ease, slamming the ball low to the right.49 min David Luiz has given away a penalty and been sent off. It was desperate defending. Mahrez chested the ball past him and moved into the area, at which point Luiz pulled him over by the shoulder. 48 min “Rob my dear chap,” says Kim Thonger. “On the subject of the thesaurus, who can possibly deny that the finest word ever invented, in any language, is prestidigitateur? Supplementary question, which footballer is best described thus? I say George Best. Discuss.”I will, just as soon as"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30783bb909a44516f3a75dd1786e788d06664d8/0_0_3506_2105/master/3506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a706e1507763dfd9554f8a3528da8746","title":"mexico churches catholic mass covid 19 coronavirus","story":"Thousands of worshippers sneak in to invitation-only assemblies organized like illegal dance parties, despite rising death tollsThe invitations arrive via text message or social media. “They ask you for a kind of password to let you in,” said Jesús Preciado, whose father has attended the secretive gatherings in the Mexican state of Jalisco.Diego Martínez, whose mother has attended the backstairs events, said they were off-limits to anyone not in the know. “It’s invitation-only,” he said. “They call you and tell you the place and the date.”The assemblies into which Preciado, Martínez and thousands of other Mexicans have been sneaking might be organised like illegal dance parties. But they are actually clandestine Catholic masses that have continued to take place in defiance of a coronavirus ban on religious events.“The bells don’t ring, there are no calls to mass,” said Antonio Hernández, who has watched worshippers steal into secret sessions at the Sagrado Corazón de Jesús church in the town of Ixtapa.“You just see the people arrive a few minutes before 6.30pm, enter the temple through the back door and then after that you start to hear their prayers,” Hernández added.The Mexican Episcopal Conference suspended mass in early March, when the first coronavirus cases were reported in Mexico.Days later the federal government suspended all religious activities involving crowds.Worshippers at the Nuestra Señora de Fátima church in Zacatecas have been allowed into secret masses on the condition they sit behind the camera live-streaming the liturgy on Facebook.In Jalisco’s capital, Guadalajara, the faithful have continued to frequent the San José y Santo Tomás de Aquino church.“I went to mass on Sunday, behind closed doors, and there were just 12 of us in the congregation,” said Susana García, a 64-year-old regular.In Durango state, catechists, choir members and youth leaders have received written notice of the underground rituals. “Only people close to the church go,” said Vicente Martínez, a member of the Catholic community in the city of Gómez Palacios.Martínez said all churches had been closed there. “But they have hidden activities for 30 or 40 people each Thursday. They do a callout where they describe it as an exclusive and private mass with refreshments after.”In late May authorities launched a mid-mass raid on one local church, the Nuestra Señora de la Luz, and caught 20 people, mostly elderly women, praying red-handed.In Brazil, home to the world’s largest Catholic congregation and also a rapidly growing and politically powerful community of born-again Christians, evangelicals have also made surreptitious church visits.“Lift up your hands and shout: ‘I wasn’t chosen to hide myself!’” Pastor Gilvrando Rodrigues shouted at a recent service for about 80 believers at his church in Rio’s biggest favela, Rocinha.“I won’t accept having to cower in a cave, I won’t accept hiding in a hole because I have a calling from God,” Rodrigues added as he encouraged his flock – most of whom were not wearing face masks – to flout social isolation for their faith.“You could have stayed at home. But you needed to be here taking care of your salvation,” the preacher said.Such services have been easier to pull off in Rio than Mexico.The city’s mayor, Marcelo Crivella, is an evangelical bishop from the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God who, alongside Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been actively pushing for churches to reopen.Rio’s state governor outlawed religious gatherings in mid-March when a partial shutdown began and a legal tug-of-war has been playing out ever since over whether churches should open, or not.“It’s all very confused,” said Rodrigues. Last week a judge ruled services could resume.Bolsonaro, who is heavily reliant on the support of some of Brazil’s most influential televangelists, has defended the right to worship and dismissed the coronavirus as a “little flu” even as his country’s death toll has soared to more than 45,000 – the second-highest tally in the world after the US.At least 60 of those deaths happened in Rocinha and Rodrigues, who himself contracted the disease early in the pandemic, admitted the virus was no joke.“But we can’t stop proclaiming the word of Christ either,” he insisted, calling churches an essential service.The pastor claimed God had allowed the pandemic, partly in order to help transform the church. Faith had become a commodity, Rodrigues complained.At a recent Sunday service he told congregants: “You’ve listened to the word and received God’s blessing. And now, whoever would like to pay tribute to the house of the Lord, feel free.“Those who give, receive,” Rodrigues added, as he asked for help to fund building work on the church. “And those who sow, will reap.”Some of the names in this report have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8be8389bc18f795f604e4fbc0b15c03a92640f/304_445_2671_1603/master/2671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc1c0eacc285689e59f77f5013071a1e","title":"maya jama i shouldnt be where i am now","story":"A jailed father, a murdered boyfriend: the DJ turned TV presenter has had some hard knocks in her 25 years. She talks about her determination to overcome them.Maya Jama speaks at twice the speed of most people, as if she is on fast-forward, as if her life moves at a faster pace than normal. It goes some way, perhaps, to explaining why, at the age of 25, she has crammed in so much already: a stint on MTV, DJing on Rinse FM, a job on Radio 1 and, now, presenting Saturday-night TV. Had this unsettling and difficult year not thrown an obstacle into her path, she would be acting in her first film around about now, too. Still, she has a brand of face masks to launch (the skincare kind), and another project she can’t talk about, which may be Strictly Come Dancing, according to newspaper rumours. Lockdown has been a bit of an enforced rest, though she has managed to buy her first house.“This is probably the most time I’ve had off since I started working when I was, like, 16,” she says. “And, yeah, it’s difficult to adjust – you find yourself running around the house. I’ve got so much energy.” We talk over Zoom, Jama at one point getting up to wander around her house, without breaking her conversational stride. But, she says, it has been “nice to chill out and work on myself a bit” – mainly learning how to cook.Until recently, many people largely knew Jama as the girlfriend of Stormzy, the grime superstar, but they broke up last year after four years together. It must have been infuriating when she had a career in her own right. “Yeah,” she says with a small laugh. “I understood at the time. He was – he is – massive in the public eye and a lot of people didn’t know who I was. But now I do feel people know my name separately, and it does feel like I’m coming into my own. It feels like I’m finally getting recognition for my hard work.”Jama has always been driven, she says – even more so when she was younger. “When I was a teenager, I was so tunnel-vision focused. My upbringing was not very … I think, statistically, the things that happened to me, or the situation I was born into, I shouldn’t have been where I am now. But I think it made me more determined to prove everybody else wrong.”Jama grew up in Bristol, and her father was in and out of prison for much of her childhood. As a young child, she says, she didn’t really notice it being a problem, “because it was normal for me. My dad’s side of my family was super-supportive and they did everything in their power to make me and my brother not feel like we were missing out on anything. And I did visit my dad in jail up until I was about 10.” Around that time, she says, “I realised that I don’t want to dedicate my time to visiting somebody who doesn’t want to dedicate their time to staying out of jail.”In 2017, she made a documentary exploring how growing up with a father in prison had affected her and other people. “I didn’t speak to him again after that.”At primary school, it wasn’t unusual for her friends to have little contact with their fathers either but at secondary school, she remembers going to friends’ houses and noticing a different family set-up. “As a child, I would make a joke out of it, like: ‘Oh well, my dad’s in jail.’ Speaking like that in front of some of my friend’s families, they would be like: ‘Maya, that’s not normal.’ Those kind of conversations started to make me think, no, that’s not how it should be, but sadly it’s reality for a lot of people.” Even now, she says, she catches herself making light of it. “That is a defence mechanism – you don’t want to make other people feel sorry for you, so you just kind of make a joke out of it.”It hasn’t been the only trauma Jama has had to deal with. In 2011, when she was 16, her boyfriend, Rico Gordon, was killed in a shooting. He lived in London and was visiting Maya in Bristol when he was caught in a gunfight between two gangs, which also injured several other bystanders. Jama, who had been on the phone to him at the time, appeared on Crimewatch, hoping to find his killers in 2012, two men were convicted.“That changed my life completely,” she says. “Losing somebody close to you as a teenager, particularly your first love, rocks your whole world and you are forced to see life differently. And you feel like life is too short. I don’t want to look back and not have done everything I wanted to do. He was an innocent man who lost his life instantly at 21, and that shocks you and it also makes you snap up, like, no, I’m not wasting time any more.”It never occurred to Jama that she wouldn’t make it. Her mother has videos of Jama at the age of six or seven declaring she would be on TV one day. “I’ve felt like maybe some people didn’t take me seriously, or people downplay my success because of relationships or because of how I look - but I know how much I’ve worked.”She landed jobs as a runner and started making videos for YouTube, which led to a presenting slot on an online football channel. Jobs in music broadcasting followed, and she has since presented documentaries, daytime TV and gameshows.She’s now co-presenting the new Saturday-night BBC1 show Save Our Summer. It was originally meant to be a companion show to the BBC’s Euro 2020 coverage, mixing football with music and comedy. Once the tournament was postponed due to coronavirus, she says, “the BBC thought: ‘Why don’t we try and bring a bit of positivity to the nation and show the things that we’re missing out on during this time, like football and music performances?’ So the aim of the show is to try and bring some happiness, despite all of the horrible things that are going on in the world.”Negativity doesn’t seem to be something Jama allows much room for. But does she ever have moments of self-doubt? “When we filmed the first episode of Save Our Summer, because I hadn’t done telly in such a while, it felt like it was my first time. I remember feeling so nervous. I went into the toilet and I had to give myself a little debrief: ‘Maya, you’re meant to do this, you’re supposed to be here, feel confident.’ I do still get nervous, and you can still sometimes get impostor syndrome. It’s just about reminding yourself that you are meant to be there.”Jama is from the generation who grew up on social media, and there have been some serious missteps – a “joke” she posted in 2012 on Twitter about “dark skin bitches” resurfaced, for which she apologised. Social media, she says, is “a blessing and a curse. It’s amazing seeing what’s happening with people fighting against racism now, and how much you can use your platform for change. I think certain conversations wouldn’t be happening if it wasn’t for social media, but at the same time it is a scary place, full of bullying and abuse and insecurities that come from comparing yourself to other people.”How does she reconcile that with the bikini pictures and beautiful selfies she posts online? Does she worry about how her younger fans perceive that? “One hundred per cent. I am just trying to be myself and hopefully young people look at me and can connect to some of the things that I’ve been through, and where I come from. I am aware that I’ll post pictures of me in bikinis, but I also will post pictures of me when I’ve just woken up and I don’t have a hair and makeup team. I think it’s about honesty. I do eat shit and I do exercise – I’m not trying to portray something that’s fake.”She has had to contend with a growing tabloid interest. Some newspapers like to take stills from her Instagram videos and freeze-frame the bits where more flesh is showing. “My mum Googled my name and was like: ‘Maya, some of these things are ridiculous,’” she says. “It would be like: ‘Maya jiggles boobs in see-through top’ and I’m in a normal white T-shirt speaking about something, and I might have done a dance move, and the whole focus is I jiggled my tits.”The week we speak, Jama, who has Somali and Swedish heritage, has been using her significant Instagram platform to talk about the killing of George Floyd in the US and the issue of white privilege. “My black family members and friends are crying and shouting out: ‘This is not OK! We’ve been dealing with it for years.’” she says. “I just hope that with all this outcry, this is where the change starts for good.”There have been times, she says, “in jobs or when I’m doing certain things for work, I will be the only person of colour there, and that sometimes can feel like: ‘Oh, am I just ticking a box?’ It shouldn’t be just me being the only person, and brands and companies and people in positions of power need to make a conscious effort to start changing what their business looks like behind the scenes as well.”We speak before protesters took down the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, where Jama grew up, but she emails her thoughts a few days later. Growing up in the city, she wasn’t, she says, really aware of the statue, “but we are all on a learning curve and having a public statue felt like an extremely inappropriate celebration of one of the most painful and unjust acts in our country’s history. The question should be why there was a statue in the first place.” Its removal, she writes, “felt long overdue. It’s not about removing or rewriting history. It’s about making Britain and other countries confront their colonial past in a meaningful way.”Thanks to all of this, her new job at the BBC has been “bittersweet”, she says. “I’ve always wanted to do a Saturday-night show, and then, at the same time, we’re in the middle of a pandemic and then there’s everything’s that’s happening in America and here. I’m quite conflicted in my emotions, so I’m celebrating, but I don’t really feel there’s anything to celebrate. Still, this feels like a massive moment for me.”Save Our Summer is on BBC One on Saturday nights at 9.15pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16bfb869cbb12945dc9ce347f4b5ef03781984cd/0_52_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d3466d6486a5d97bd44214933925f2","title":"buskers return to british london streets coronavirus","story":"As lockdown measures are eased, street musicians entertain the queues of shoppers – but there are concerns about how to pay themOn 13 March, singer-songwriter Sherika Sherard completed her final busk at London Bridge. Given the increasing seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic, her mum hadn’t wanted her to go. She did anyway. “We weren’t yet under lockdown – and it was one of the best sessions,” said Sherard. After three months on the government’s income support scheme for self-employed people, she was back on the capital’s streets on 16 June, entertaining the queue outside Selfridges’ Oxford Street store as part of its programme of “joyful experiences”. “People will really appreciate it now, as long as buskers are mindful,” said Sherard. “Buskers in London is a sign of the norm.”The day before, in Manchester, Laurie Wright was on the first stop of his It Could Be Worse, You Could Be on Lockdown mini tour, performing covers and originals for the queues in Market Street to a noisy reception. “I came out because the shops are opening again, and there’s money to be made,” he said. “It’s good to be out and for things to be kind of moving back to normal, even if they’re not.”Buskers know that their artistry depends on cooperation with local communities and councils, especially since they must now be mindful about crowds and social distancing. Despite pre-pandemic crackdowns on city-centre buskers, many councils have included busking in their plans for the public returning to the high street. Cardiff city council will create a number of “spill-out” spaces where managed social activities such as busking can resume. Cheshire West and Chester council stated that buskers can return “as long as they observe two-metre distancing and don’t attract a crowd of spectators that makes social distancing difficult or causes an obstruction”. The city has a street welcome team offering guidance to buskers on maintaining social distancing.While buskers have been off the streets during lockdown, their music has not ceased. The charity, Keep Streets Live, which seeks to protect public spaces for “informal offerings of music and the arts”, invited buskers to live-stream performances on their Facebook page, where appreciative listeners could tip via PayPal. Classical guitarist busker Billy Watman has been virtually busking on Facebook, collecting tips through The Busking Project, which offers buskers an online showcase. Watman does not see this as a solution, but “the best we can do at the time”.Sherard said she had been offered streaming opportunities on the social media platforms of several brands, who did not offer payment. “They were just wanting more content on their pages,” she says. The emphasis on exposure over payment is a sticking point: “Putting your phone to record and singing live is not really going to cost the companies that much.”The return to the high street brings with it concerns about the exchange of physical money. While the World Health Organisation countered claims that banknotes could transmit Covid-19, it has emphasised the importance of hand-washing after handling cash. Keep Streets Live’s Safe and Socially Distant Busking Guide recommends that buskers use “a box with plastic inside for your drops” but stresses the public health benefits of a cashless reader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a49109ddc2303be506252b7358f32aafd53d1fb2/150_212_2146_1287/master/2146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=020ea017480e2b00a24c4d2e8be9f73d","title":"mobos founder open letter racism uk music industry","story":"Kanya King says event could have collapsed after inaccurate press reports discouraged sponsorsKanya King, the founder of the Music of Black Origin awards (Mobos), has said negative media coverage nearly ended the event, in a wide-ranging open letter that calls for racism in the British music industry to “no longer be swept under a red carpet”.King, who founded the Mobos in 1996, sent the letter to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and told the  the awards show could very easily “not be in business” after inaccurate reports about the event made sponsors reticent to be associated with it.King says that after an incident at a record label afterparty after the 2002 Mobos, press reports – including a story in the Sun with the headline “Stars flee riot at award party” – led to her remortgaging her home to avoid the Mobos collapsing when sponsors backed away.“In the article there was talk of guns and stabbings yet none of it had anything to do with our event,” King wrote. “Although our show had been very well received, the perception among the general public and commercial partners changed after that … we almost went under and I had to remortgage my home again to put further funds into the business to keep it going.”King said she had felt satisfied after the 2002 show, and then woke up to negative headlines. “I remember being in shock. I didn’t truly realise the ramifications for us as an organisation. Companies, brands – no one wanted to talk to us.”In the letter King says artists who have won Mobo awards are often only referred to as a past winner if they are “linked to any kind of trouble”, and that the media will completely erase their Mobo success if they have also won or been nominated for a Brit award.King – who received an MBE in 1999 and featured in BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour 2013 list of powerful British women – said she had been excluded from previous attempts by the music industry to tackle inequality and wants to see firm action.She said: “I’ve been hearing music industry bodies saying to me: ‘We want to do more surveys or more reports.’ I’m sick of all these reports. I just want to see action. That’s what I want to see. The question I asked myself is: ‘What do I have to do? What do I have to prove to get a seat at that table?’”The Mobo founder said the industry needed to involve black businesses, institutions and communities, which nurtured talent but were then excluded from “the financial rewards that have driven billions to the UK and global economies and helped create entire industries”. She also called for more high-level black and minority ethnic executives and for the music industry to investigate and address the ethnicity pay gap.King said the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests had created a moment where the music industry could change but said she had found the pledges of support from some labels to be hypocritical. “I think it’s pretty galling, to read some of the announcements or pledges and statements of solidarity when our previous calls fell on deaf ears,” she said.“I am proud of what we’ve managed to do and the lives we’ve been able to change for the better. But just imagine what more we could have done had we not been held back and been excluded?“We’ve been fighting for over 25 years, I’ve dedicated my life to championing black music and culture. I’ve reached out to lots of people and sent ideas and suggestions. Over the years there have been promises, initiatives, fresh starts and pledges. But for me they were just empty words.”King said the open letter, which is subtitled “An inconvenient truth”, was the most difficult one she had ever felt compelled to write and that it outlined her experiences growing up in Britain.She said her brother had ongoing health issues and barely left his house after being racially abused while watching a football game. Her sister began wearing lighter foundation after facing discrimination at work. “It is traumatic watching so many people you care about having hopes and dreams being wasted,” she wrote. has approached Dowden for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5996c515b340da8f321af56908dc9216d2ca7ca3/0_0_1114_668/master/1114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b598670e3845330f93be1fddf948b7b","title":"spanish opera house reopens with concert for plants barcelona","story":"String quartet will play Puccini for potted audience at grand venue in BarcelonaAttendees of the first post-lockdown concert at Barcelona’s Liceu opera house next week will not need masks or gloves, nor will they be required to observe physical distancing.But they might like to take along a nice comfy pot and a little water to prevent their roots from drying out as a string quartet serenades them, fittingly, with Puccini’s Crisantemi (Chrysanthemums).Well aware of the need to return with a spectacle as grabby as a venus flytrap, the Catalan venue has announced a concert for 2,292 plants when it reopens next Monday. Non-vegetable music fans will also be able to enjoy the performance as it will be livestreamed.According to the Liceu’s artistic director, Víctor García de Gomar, the Concert for the Biocene is intended to help us ponder the current state of the human condition and how, in lockdown, we have become “an audience deprived of the possibility of being an audience”.When the twin violins, viola and cello of the Uceli quartet strike up “for the vegetable kingdom” at 5pm next Monday, “humans will become the spectators of their own social chronicle”, García de Gomas said .Eugenio Ampudia, the conceptual artist behind the concert, said it aimed to reflect what has happened across Spain and around the world as the Covid-19 pandemic has forced people to retreat from shared public areas.“At a time when an important part of humankind has shut itself up in enclosed spaces and been obliged to relinquish movement, nature has crept forward to occupy the spaces we have ceded,” said Ampudia.“And it has done so at is own rhythm, according to its patient biological cycle. Can we broaden our empathy and bring it to bear on other species? Let’s start by using art and music and inviting nature into a great concert hall.”When the strings fall silent and palms have been duly pressed together in appreciation, the plants will be donated to 2,292 health workers as thanks for their efforts over recent months.

This is the story of how its invention went on to change the world“The best thing since sliced bread.” We’ve all heard the saying. It’s synonymous with greatness, a new invention, a game-changer. But the road to greatness is seldom easy.Sliced bread was first sold in July 1928, in a bakery in Chillicothe, Missouri. The bakery used an automatic bread-slicing machine invented by jeweller Otto Rohwedder. It had been hard work to get to that point: Rohwedder had tried for some time to introduce the US to sliced bread. He’d carried out extensive market research, surveying tens of thousands of people on the perfect thickness of a slice. And his prototype machine and all his blueprints were lost to a fire in 1917.Despite grumbling from the baking industry, which voiced concerns about his new-fangled idea, the concept became a hit. The Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune hailed the “thrill of pleasure” that a housewife would get at no longer having to carve up a whole loaf. “So neat and precise are the slices, and so definitely better than anyone could possibly slice by hand with a bread knife that one realises instantly that here is a refinement that will receive a hearty and permanent welcome,” it said. The page was topped with a slogan describing the invention as: “The greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped” – the phrase that became today’s “greatest thing since sliced bread”.But Rohwedder’s creation wasn’t an instant hit. Pre-sliced loaves went stale faster than whole loaves, and some shoppers also felt they were “sloppy looking”. Rohwedder wasn’t deterred. He produced u-shaped pins to hold loaves together, so they looked more appealing.Yet it still wasn’t plain sailing for the humble sliced loaf. As soon as they got used to their easier-to-use bread, Americans were robbed of it. In early 1943 the government banned it, citing the war effort, with steel for bread-slicing machines required for weaponry, and the thick wax paper also needed for more important uses. “The ready-sliced loaf must have a heavier wrapping than an unsliced one if it is not to dry out,” US food administrator Claude R Wickard told the New York Times. “So, the order prohibiting the slicing of bread is aimed at affecting economies in the manufacture of bread and in the use of paper.”Fast forward to 2020 and sliced bread is now commonplace worldwide. Like any great invention, its history is full of highs and lows, victories and losses, innovation and invention.

In the end, they transformed computing as we know itWhen legendary chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov found himself beaten by IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer, it was seen as a seminal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence.It was New York, 1997 and for the first time ever a computer had beaten a world champion under tournament conditions. This was the culmination of a journey in which the first stirrings of what we now call artificial intelligence and machine learning were born. A road trodden by war heroes and student researchers alike, whose singular desire to create a program that could beat the very best in the world would shape an entire science.Early originsChess lends itself well to computer programming. Where other games can depend more on gut instinct or physical skill, chess is a game of strict binary rules – a move is either correct or it isn’t.It’s a game where multiple permutations, strategies and responses to moves and gambits could all be pre-programmed. Teaching a computer how to select the best option from those available to counter a problem, though, was the tricky part, and that’s where machine learning came in.Given the close relationship between chess, logic and programming it’s no surprise that the driving forces of early computerised incarnations of chess were academics whose love of the game dovetailed with their desire to push the boundaries of the burgeoning field of computer science.One of those academics was Alan Turing. He may have made his name breaking Nazi ciphers at Bletchley Park, but he also helped lay the early groundwork for computerised chess too. In 1947, while working at the University of Manchester, Turing developed the first simple algorithm that was capable of analysing an opponent’s move one step ahead. Four years later, his academic colleague DG Prinz wrote a program that could solve particular moves, but not play a game.Competitive gamesThe 1960s saw computer chess start to come into its own. In 1967, MacHack VI, a program written by MIT student Richard Greenblatt, was able to draw a game in a US Chess Federation tournament, losing four. But this was just the start and its results began to improve.New York City hosted the first US computer championship in 1970 it was won by Chess 3.0, a program put together by a team from Northwestern University.And in 1988, HiTech, a computer developed at Carnegie Mellon University, defeated grandmaster Arnold Denker, in a match. In the same year, another Carnegie Mellon program, Deep Thought, defeated top-notch grandmaster Bent Larsen in a tournament game.Humans strike backDeep Thought’s defeat of Larsen was a huge moment for early AI. But this success was short-lived – the program was easily bested later that year by Garry Kasparov.This setback prompted the team behind Deep Thought to push further and further to refine their model. In their view, Kasparov’s success was simply check – but it wasn’t check mate. The team’s success caught the eye of US computer giant IBM, which brought them aboard as part of a dedicated chess programming group tasked with devising a way to beat Kasparov and they developed a successor to Deep Thought called Deep Blue. It incorporated a sophisticated new multiprocessing system that enabled it to consider as many as 50bn positions in three minutes, about a thousand times faster than Deep Thought’s system.Kasparov vs Deep BlueDeep Blue made its professional chess-playing debut in a six-game match with Kasparov in Philadelphia in February 1996. A bumper $500,000 prize and IBM covering the match on its website – the web was still in its infancy back then – helped draw huge media attention.Deep Blue won the first game, but Kasparov adapted his tactics to win three and draw two of the remaining games to win the match 4–2.But in a six-game rematch held in May 1997 in New York City, an upgraded Deep Blue was able to consider an average of 200m positions a second, twice its previous speed. Its algorithm was also improved with input from human grandmasters.Kasparov played smart though, he was conservative with his moves which threw Deep Blue off balance – it hadn’t expected it. But after resigning the second game even though it was drawable, the Russian said he never recovered mentally. With the match tied at one win, one loss, and three draws, Deep Blue won the decisive final game in 19 moves.Influence on AIThe lessons learned from the desire to create a program that could beat a human chess champion enhanced AI.Murray Campbell, one of IBM’s top AI experts, originally worked on the Deep Thought and Deep Blue projects. He now works on artificial neural networks and credits the quest to master chess programs with helping his team understand the importance of identifying the differences between how humans and machines think, but also in how they’re similar.Efforts to master chess, though, still continue to drive the development of AI. One of the criticisms of Deep Blue and subsequent machines is that they relied on the “brute force” application of their superior memory skills – they could remember more permutations than a human. They could out-calculate, rather than out-think.AI company DeepMind’s algorithm AlphaZero set out to change that. It could teach itself how to play chess and learn from its own mistakes. Not only that, it was able to play with intuition and finesse, destroying the reigning artificial chess champion Stockfish during a match in 2017. It played like a human and at times appeared to even toy with its opponent before delivering a killer blow.Even now, the desire for the perfect tech-mate is continuing to push the boundaries of AI.Technology drives the world, and is the beating heart of every BMW.

It is central for our businesses and our private citizens both in the UK and in the European Union. It is crucial to ensure that what has been agreed is actually done.”The EU wants a blockbuster deal with a cross-cutting dispute mechanism covering everything from trade to transport and judicial cooperation to fisheries. A clear breach of the deal could allow either side to retaliate by suspending a part of the relationship.Downing Street has opposed the governance proposal, insisting there should be a series of separate sectoral agreements.It is understood that EU officials fear that this seemingly arcane issue could prove to be the most difficult on which to find a compromise in the short time left before the transition period ends.In a sign of EU doubts over Boris Johnson’s claim on Monday that a deal could be secured in six weeks, a leaked document obtained by Reuters revealed that the German government was instead earmarking September as the key month.The government document, dated 15 June, reads: “From September, the negotiations enter a hot phase. Britain is already escalating threats in Brussels, wants to settle as much as possible in the shortest possible time and hopes to achieve last-minute success in the negotiations.“It is therefore important to preserve the unity of the 27, to continue to insist on parallel progress in all areas (overall package) and to make it clear that there will be no agreement at any price. Therefore, both national and European contingency planning would now have to start in order to be prepared for a no deal 2.0.”EU officials believe the real deadline is 31 October, after which any deal would need to be ratified by the European parliament.Von der Leyen told MEPs on Wednesday: “We are now halfway through these negotiations. But we’re definitely not halfway through the work to reach an agreement. With little time ahead of us we’ll do all in our power to reach an agreement.”Alongside dispute resolution, Von der Leyen mentioned agreement on “level playing field” conditions to ensure fair competition between British and EU businesses, access to UK fishing waters and police cooperation as the main areas of contention.There is also continued consternation in Brussels about the UK’s refusal to engage in talks on future security and defence cooperation.Echoing comments from the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, this month when he complained that he did not understand the British position, the bloc’s ambassador to the UK, João Vale de Almeida, told Bloomberg that member states remained open on the issue if Downing Street reconsidered.Von der Leyen hinted, however, at an EU compromise on fisheries by merely seeking “guarantees and predictability” for European fleet rather than the status quo.Following a videoconference meeting on Monday between Johnson and EU institution leaders including Von der Leyen, both sides committed to “intensify” talks in July and if possible reach “an early understanding on the principles underlying any agreement”.EU officials are as keen as Downing Street to secure early agreement, and the European council president, Charles Michel, will present the latest on the negotiations to leaders by video conference on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8433f4dd01db2be4ec192e4eddfa4dfcfb90dc0/0_151_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00eda4d849f955be87b98dcb150148ee","title":"labour quizzes pm on planning decision that saved tory donor 40m","story":"Boris Johnson asked to disclose any contact with donor Richard Desmond prior to housing minister overruling councilBoris Johnson is facing pressure to disclose any meetings he had with Richard Desmond before a minister overruled planners, saving the former Express newspapers owner about £40m on a London property development.After Johnson was quizzed about the issue at prime minister’s questions, Labour formally asked for details of any contact with Desmond since he had entered No 10, and with other Conservative party donors.It follows scrutiny of links between Desmond and Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, who overturned a decision by a local council and the government’s planning inspectorate in order to approve a 500-apartment, 44-storey development in east London, Westferry Printworks, on a former printing plant.Jenrick’s move in January came a day before the introduction of the community infrastructure levy, to be used for local education and health projects, which would have cost Desmond’s company at least £40m.It later emerged that Jenrick had sat next to Desmond at a Conservative fundraising dinner in November, and that Desmond donated £12,000 to the party two weeks after the planning decision in his favour.After the local council, Tower Hamlets, sought a judicial review of Jenrick’s decision, he conceded the case, admitting he had acted unlawfully.The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, is examining details of the case provided by Jenrick, but No 10 has denied this amounts to a formal investigation.At PMQs, the Labour MP Chris Matheson asked whether any of Johnson’s officials or advisers had discussed the planning decision with Jenrick, and whether he would publish all relevant correspondence.Johnson said he “certainly had no correspondence about this matter myself and nor, as far as I’m aware, did any of my officials”, adding that Jenrick would write to Matheson on the issue.Labour subsequently asked for information on how many times Johnson had met Desmond or other party donors since becoming prime minister.Steve Reed, the shadow communities secretary, said: “He must now come clean about when he and his advisers met Desmond since taking office, and must ask the cabinet secretary to launch a formal investigation into any breaches of the ministerial code to show the Conservatives have not been accepting cash for favours.”A Downing Street source said: “No one in No 10 has discussed this application with Mr Desmond, and No 10 has had no involvement with the secretary of state’s appeal decision.”Jenrick has denied any wrongdoing in his decision over the application for Westferry Printworks, which is live once again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01279f0082b7af4c411189682bba4ef20d7ddd31/425_73_1014_608/master/1014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37b01d828b4f729d8392e66b2dd02dde","title":"coronavirus uk live government urged to explain future of shielded status","story":"Culture secretary says he is looking into how arts venues can reopen as top figures warn theatre faces ruin UK’s official death toll rises by 184 to 42,153 excess deaths in Scotland at lowest level since AprilThat’s it from us on the UK side. If you would like to continue following the ’s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture.Here are the main points from Oliver Dowden’s press conference.Dowden said that cinemas might benefit from the 2-metre rule being replaced by a 1-metre rule “because I think they are better able to operate at lower capacities”. But he said that a 1-metre rule would not be enough to allow theatres to operate in a way that was financially viable. He went on:So I think we may be looking at some time for theatres to be returning to a state where they can perform sensibly, which is why I’ve been discussing what other support we can provide them with.Until now, when discussing help for theatres, ministers have generally stressed that the sector has gained from the support available to businesses generally, like the furlough scheme.We do need greater flexibility to overcome some of the very specific and practical obstacles to the return of live performance. So that’s why over the next week we will be convening experts in a targeted way, bringing together our leading performers in theatres, choirs and orchestras with medical experts and advisers.And the idea is that they will work together in detail to develop that roadmap which is so badly needed to performing safely – with a particular focus on piloting innovative ideas that may permit live performances.I very much hope that we will be able to stick to that roadmap and we will see tourism return to the UK.I would really hope that by the return of the new season we might be in a position whereby some fans could start to return to stadiums. And he said talks were already under way on how fans could return to stadiums. He said:We are having intensive engagement to look at how that could be done safely.Clearly we will not only look at the positioning of fans and where they are relative to each other but there is all the issues with how you get in and out of stadiums in a safe way, how you have access to conveniences and everything else.I want to be clear on this, we are having these discussions – I am not at this stage indicating that this is going to happen but of course it is the final step in the five-stage process.I think that we have always spent money on promoting the UK around the world. I see this with creative industries – we genuinely are a creative industries superpower and we should be promoting that and we’ve done that through the great campaign. I think that the work on Voyager is part of that promotion.Matt Hancock has apologised for a “human mistake” after he broke 2-metre social distancing rules in the House of Commons.Footage from the chamber shows the healthsecretary placing his arm around a fellow MP as he arrived for PMQs this afternoon.He then stood well within 2 metres of his colleague while waiting to be seated, despite floor markings to guide MPs as they enter the chamber.A third MP then appears to the pair’s right, and the MP Hancock had placed his arm around steps back, appearing to do so to stay socially distant.After the incident, Hancock said in a statement: I’m so sorry for a human mistake on my part.Like all of us, I instinctively wanted to reach out to a friend I’d just seen - in this case, for the first time in many weeks. I realised my mistake and corrected myself.It shows how hard social distancing can be but it is so important that we all keep trying to do our bit.Parliament advice on proceedings during the Covid-19 pandemic states Commonsphysical proceedings should be socially distanced and “in line with public health guidance”.Guidance from the Department of Health and Social Care states people should stay 2 metres apart from anyone outside of their household – rules Hancock has consistently promoted.Covid-19 has been identified among inmates in a new prison, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice revealed.The numbers are not live cases and include those who have recovered. There are around 79,700 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons.The current regime, which has seen a ban on family visits, reduced time spent out of cells to about 30 minutes a day, suspended prison transfers and forced new arrivals to be quarantined for 14 days, has been hailed a success by ministers as deaths and infection rates behind bars have been significantly lower than expected.At least 23 prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre.Many GPs raised concerns about the government’s response to the crisis, including issues around the test-and-trace programme as well as shortfalls of PPE earlier in the crisis.Commenting on the survey, Prof Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of GPs, told PA Media: The pandemic is far from over and getting through the next phases of tackling it will necessitate healthcare professionals across the NHS having confidence in decision makers.As lockdown restrictions are lifted, general practice will be at the forefront of dealing with any health consequences resulting from the pandemic - directly or indirectly.Our profession needs to be told well ahead of announcements being made that will impact on our patients’ lives, and given appropriate, unambiguous guidance to support practices to implement any changes, so that we can prepare to give our patients the most appropriate health advice.The Duke of Cambridge has thanked those involved in getting Premier League football going again as his beloved Aston Villa prepared to face Sheffield United in the first game of the restart.He signed off the tweet from the Kensington Royal Twitter account: So good to have football back, we have all missed it!

He walked out of the ward to applause from colleagues.Felix Khor, 68, spent 45 days in the intensive care ward at Southend hospital where he has worked for 15 years, and was on a ventilator. He then spent several weeks on a different ward.Khor was admitted to hospital in early April at the height of lockdown and was discharged on Monday. Up to 200 NHS staff lined the hospital’s main corridor to clap for him as he was wheeled out of intensive care last month.Khor, who lives in Shoebury, joined Southend hospital in 2005 as part of the resuscitation training team. He continued working at the hospital following his retirement as part of the staff bank in the emergency department.Recalling the moment he was clapped out of intensive care, Khor told the PA Media news agency: There were consultants, doctors, matrons, nurses, domestics every uniform you could think of.I never realised that so many people cared about me. It was amazing to have been in lots of people’s prayers and thoughts it has been a huge morale boost.Waking up and everyone knowing your name has been a little bit surreal, but I thank everyone for their kind thoughts.Staff have been so caring, supporting and encouraging.I keep saying to people that, honestly, words cannot express enough my gratitude to the care I have been given.He plans to retire after recovering from Covid-19 and is looking forward to gardening.Q: What do you say to people who have lost their jobs? I have spoken to people in the hospitality industry going on benefits for the first time?Dowden says the government has spent tens of billions trying to protect jobs.We need to reopen business, he says. People need to get their jobs back.Q: What would you say to a person I spoke to who has joined a group that thinks the delayed lockdown cost 20,000 lives. What have been the goverment’s worst mistakes?Dowden says ministers made the decision, informed by the scientific advice.He says the UK acted at about the same time as other countries.And he claims it is too early to make comparison about which countries did best.Q: Will there be an inquiry?Of course there will be lessons to be learnt, he says.When meaningful comparisons can be made, lessons from them will be learnt, he says.Q: Ministers did say we should not expect to have summer holidays abroad. Has that changed? Will people be able to go on holiday in August?Dowden says the government is looking at air corridors. But it will be driven by the public health issues.Q: When will Britain be open for tourism?Dowden says the government has set out a roadmap. The next stage is 4 July. He says he very much hopes that we will be able to stick to that, and see tourism return to the UK.He wants to be out there making the case for British tourism.But it has to be safe, he says.He says guidance will be published on this.Q: Is £900,000 on repainting the RAF Voyager a good use of public money?Dowden says he sees this as part of promoting Great Britain, which is a good use of money.Dowden says his office has been in touch with the mayor of London’s office about the Churchill statue in Parliament Square. He says the mayor is in charge of that. But he hopes the mayor will allow it to be uncovered soon. He says he hopes that will happen before President Macron comes to London.Dowden says a 1-metre rule would benefit cinemas. They can operate with smaller audiences. But theatres would still have problems.He says he has been in touch with Andrew Lloyd Webber about what happens in Seoul.He says it may take some time before theatres can operate sensibly. So they may need financial support, he says.Q: What will the police do if people congregate outside football stadiums?Dowden says the police have appropriate powers. He hopes they won’t be able to use them.There is nothing to be gained from congregating outside a stadium, he says.Q: Should Marcus Rashford get a knighthood?Dowden says he has been very impressed by Rashford’s lobbying skills. But he says it is not for him to give out knighthoods.Q: Are there security implications from the collision outside parliament?Dowden says he is not aware of any security implications. But he can tell people the PM is unscathed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22a33ea04debea99b875d5d761fd585c4ba4a27b/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8e8a130c95542a01556347881a094db","title":"tell us how coronavirus affected people living midlands","story":"We’d like to hear how the pandemic has affected people in the Midlands, especially anyone who works in the health sectorWe would like to hear how the coronavirus pandemic has affected you and your community.We would like to hear from people in the Midlands about how you have been affected by the pandemic, particularly if you are involved in the health sector or any community networks that have been organised to provide people with care and support due to coronavirus.

He started off great, and then he didn’t end up very great in terms of a player. He was terrific in his rookie year. I think he was very good in his second year. And then something happened. So his playing wasn’t up to snuff.“The answer is absolutely I would. As far as kneeling, I would love to see him get another shot. But obviously he has to be able to play well. If he can’t play well, I think it would be very unfair.”The 32-year-old Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since the end of the 2016 season, when he began kneeling during the national anthem as a protest against social injustice in the United States. He was then frozen out of the league, but as anti-racism protests have swept the US following the death of George Floyd, there is a feeling teams may be more open to signing Kaepernick, who led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2013.Trump’s comments are a far cry from those he made in 2017, when he called players who knelt during the national anthem “sons of bitches”.Earlier on Wednesday, Lynn said Kaepernick is an interesting prospect for NFL teams as the new season approaches.“I haven’t spoken with Colin, not sure where he’s at as far in his career, what he wants to do, but Colin definitely fits the style of quarterback for the system that we’re going to be running,” Lynn told ESPN on Wednesday. “I’m very confident and happy with the three quarterbacks that I have but you can never have too many people waiting on the runway.”Earlier this month, the NFL admitted it had been wrong not to listen to players like Kaepernick who have peacefully protested against social injustice. This week, the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, said he would encourage teams to sign Kaepernick. Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll says he has heard from at least one team interested in signing Kaepernick.While it is unlikely Kaepernick would secure a job as a starter, he is still in his prime years as a player and would be a strong candidate for a back-up role. Kaepernick has continued to stay in shape during his exile from the NFL, and says he still practices five times a week.The 2020 NFL season is scheduled to start in September, with training camps resuming in July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12a3ce5bd4c7ab4a467e8160ec77d896efa2746e/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=38ddfbfe69fe95a1d0520cb2ed2f03b7","title":"himalayan flashpoint could spiral out of control as india and china face off","story":"At least 20 died after soldiers fought with clubs and rocks along the disputed border, making de-escalation hard for the nuclear statesThe forces of two nuclear weapons states have set about each other with clubs and rocks at one of the most forbidding flashpoints in the world, in a bloody incident that highlights the constant dangers posed by expansionist nationalism.India has confirmed that it lost at least 20 of its men in a clash with Chinese soldiers near the disputed mountain border running along the Ladakh area of Kashmir. It is the first fatal confrontation since 1975 and the most serious since 1967, and so can be expected to have a powerful galvanising effect on the populations of both countries, already primed by a constant stream of nationalist rhetoric.There is a long history of such encounters ever since the two nations fought a short war there in 1962. After that conflict a Line of Actual Control (LAC) was declared, but there is no agreed line and limited control, as the events of recent weeks have confirmed. Thus far at least, both Indian and Chinese forces have stuck to an agreement not to carry firearms on patrol near the LAC.Beijing has put out a string of statements blaming India but giving no hint of Chinese casualties, estimated in the Indian press to total 43, including some deaths. In the past, such accounting has come decades later, if at all, from a regime that tightly controls information. For that reason, the only detailed accounts to have emerged so far have come from the Indian press.What is clear is that there will be more of these clashes without a clear change of direction and an attempt to agree on where the LAC should be, and how both sides should behave around it. Both Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping have built their images as warriors for national greatness.In his remarks on Wednesday, Modi warned the sacrifice of the soldiers would not be in vain and that India is capable of giving a “befitting reply” if provoked.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, after speaking to his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, issued his own warning, that India should not underestimate “China’s firm will to safeguard territorial sovereignty”.In the broadest terms the deadly brawl in the Galwan valley was the latest symptom of an increasingly aggressive Chinese policy on territory and borders, of the sort that has been playing out among the rocks and reefs of the South China Sea.Over the decades China has been more assertive than India in building infrastructure around the LAC, with roads and bunkers. In recent years, India has been trying to catch up, in particular with a road to the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO), the highest airstrip in the world, with feeder roads leading off it. China has been trying to push back against that Indian construction work, so that its creeping occupation of the Galwan valley goes unchallenged.Since May, Chinese troops appear to have stopped their Indian counterparts from approaching areas where both sides have patrolled over the years. And Beijing has sent in reinforcements. What distinguishes the current confrontation from previous incidents is not just the death toll but the fact that there have been standoffs in multiple locations.“This kind of territory is incredibly hard to hold, but also to move multiple troops over,” said Tanvi Madan, director of the India project at the Brookings Institution. “So it’s not considered to be something that just happened on the ground. It’s clearly a decision made by the Chinese at a more senior level.”It is not just about bragging rights over crags. China has built a road, Highway 219, linking Tibet and Xinjiang, that passes through territory near the LAC that India considers its own. India’s foothold at the DBO airfield, on the other hand, allows its forces to look down at the Karakoram highway linking China and Pakistan.The timing of the incident may be connected to the weather. The melting snows of spring provide an opportunity for aggressive moves. The pandemic may also have played a role. It led to India putting off military exercises, and an extra motive for Beijing to look for distractions from its own failures in governance.The deadly clash happened at a time and a place where officers from both sides were trying to negotiate a disengagement of forces. Neither government wants this to escalate, and the foreign ministers on Wednesday agreed on resuming the disengagement process. But the fact that there has been significant loss of life, at least on the Indian side, makes the situation much harder to defuse.“Now domestic politics and public opinion, especially nationalist pressure to avenge their deaths and escalate, becomes a dangerous force,” Vipin Narang, a security studies professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. “It will be hard for India at least, with a relatively open media, to de-escalate as easily now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38576c8fbcc7fd96858ed761477b201614373050/0_226_6123_3674/master/6123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c09fc8672026dcc3ccd51f0adc2019cc","title":"americans reportedly find loophole violate canadas covid 19 border closure","story":"Officials investigating reports that US citizens are crossing border on pretext of visiting Alaska, only to stay in CanadaFor some Americans, the prospect of visiting the Rocky Mountains without hordes of visitors cramming its picturesque trails and alpine towns, is so tempting that they’re prepared to risk arrest.Canadian officials are investigating reports that American tourists are making covert forays into the country, violating a border closure imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus.The frontier has remained closed since 21 March, but US citizens without coronavirus symptoms are still allowed to enter Canada in order to reach the US state of Alaska. Such travelers are required to use drive-thru windows for food and pay for gas at the pump, and must undergo quarantine if they use a hotel.But a string of reports suggests that some US citizens are crossing the border on the pretext of visiting Alaska – only to stay in Canada.One resident of Banff, Alberta, posted on Facebook that a Texas family had visited a restaurant, allegedly telling staff they had found a “loophole” in travel restrictions, allowing them to secretly vacation in the region.Such reports have prompted the deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, to plead with Americans to avoid entering the country.“I would say to our American friends and neighbours: I love the Rockies, too. I grew up in Alberta. Personally, I can think of no better place to spend time. But now is not the time to visit. Hopefully, we will be back to normal at some point soon,” she said. “These measures are in place for a reason. They are to protect us, and they are to protect our neighbours.”The United States has more than 2m documented cases of the coronavirus, with new surges reported in a number of states. Earlier this week, the two countries agreed the border would remain closed until at least 21 July.“We’re not yet sure whether we really have a large issue or whether we have a couple of isolated events that have been widely circulated,” Staff Sgt Michael Buxton-Carr of Banff RCMP told Global News, following at least two reports of Americans vacationing in the region.In the case of a clear breach of the rules, Canadian police could lay charges – or escort lockdown scofflaws to a government quarantine facility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ecf43ee0f1c8fc7a0532702506a81c97dd63bc/0_64_3316_1990/master/3316.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9d3c11bf8121793e2b4b9d37ae7d2aad","title":"pandemics destruction nature un who legislation trade green recovery","story":"Experts call for legislation and trade deals worldwide to encourage green recoveryPandemics such as coronavirus are the result of humanity’s destruction of nature, according to leaders at the UN, WHO and WWF International, and the world has been ignoring this stark reality for decades.The illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade as well as the devastation of forests and other wild places were still the driving forces behind the increasing number of diseases leaping from wildlife to humans, the leaders told the .They are calling for a green and healthy recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular by reforming destructive farming and unsustainable diets.WWF’s head in the UK said post-Brexit trade deals that fail to protect nature would leave Britain “complicit in increasing the risk of the next pandemic”.High-level figures have issued a series of warnings since March, with the world’s leading bioersity experts saying even more deadly disease outbreaks are likely in future unless the rampant destruction of the natural world is rapidly halted.Earlier in June, the UN environment chief and a leading economist said Covid-19 was an “SOS signal for the human enterprise” and that current economic thinking did not recognise that human wealth depends on nature’s health.“We have seen many diseases emerge over the years, such as Zika, Aids, Sars and Ebola and they all originated from animal populations under conditions of severe environmental pressures,” said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, head of the UN convention on biological ersity, Maria Neira, the World Health Organization director for environment and health, and Marco Lambertini, head of WWF International, in the  article.With coronavirus, “these outbreaks are manifestations of our dangerously unbalanced relationship with nature”, they said. “They all illustrate that our own destructive behaviour towards nature is endangering our own health – a stark reality we’ve been collectively ignoring for decades.“Worryingly, while Covid-19 has given us yet another reason to protect and preserve nature, we have seen the reverse take place. From the Greater Mekong, to the Amazon and Madagascar, alarming reports have emerged of increased poaching, illegal logging and forest fires, while many countries are engaging in hasty environmental rollbacks and cuts in funding for conservation. This all comes at a time when we need it most.“We must embrace a just, healthy and green recovery and kickstart a wider transformation towards a model that values nature as the foundation for a healthy society. Not doing so, and instead attempting to save money by neglecting environmental protection, health systems, and social safety nets, has already proven to be a false economy. The bill will be paid many times over.”The WWF report concludes the key drivers for diseases that move from wild animals to humans are the destruction of nature, the intensification of agriculture and livestock production, as well as the trading and consumption of high-risk wildlife.The report urges all governments to introduce and enforce laws to eliminate the destruction of nature from supply chains of goods and on the public to make their diets more sustainable.Beef, palm oil and soy are among the commodities frequently linked to deforestation and scientists have said avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way for people to reduce their environmental impact on the planet.Tanya Steele, the head of WWF UK, said the post-Brexit trade deals must protect nature: “We cannot be complicit in increasing the risk of the next pandemic. We need strong legislation and trade deals that stop us importing food that is the result of rampant deforestation or whose production ignores poor welfare and environmental standards in producer countries. The government has a golden opportunity to make transformative, world-leading change happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea83d0e5344cd58810caef54434dca3d6f7de043/0_134_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e66f662007d7d4fe94820b2b4eeb76","title":"uk ministers order urgent vitamin d coronavirus review","story":"Exclusive: emerging evidence studied to see if ‘sunshine nutrient’ could lower Covid-19 riskPublic health officials are urgently reviewing the potential ability of vitamin D to reduce the risk of coronavirus.A delayed Public Health England review into the reasons why BAME people are disproportionately affected, which pointed to historical racism, did not review the role of diet and vitamin D.The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) began this work last month and is considering recent evidence on vitamin D and acute respiratory tract infection in the general population. Evidence will be considered on specific population groups, including those of different ages and BAME groups. In a parallel development, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is conducting a “rapid” evidence review on vitamin D “in the context of Covid-19” with support from Public Health England (PHE).It is understood the reviews will be published in the coming weeks. The Nice review may be used alongside other available information, such as specific patient circumstances, to inform inidual healthcare decisions. Public Health Scotland and NHS boards are also assessing emerging evidence to see whether the so-called sunshine nutrient should be prescribed in hospitals and to high-risk groups to mitigate a second wave of Covid-19.Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, welcomed the reviews and said deaths among BAME NHS staff had brought the question of vitamin D deficiency to the fore.“Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections,” he said. “It boosts the ability of cells to kill and resist viruses and simultaneously dampens down harmful inflammation, which is one of the big problems with Covid.”He is leading a national study collecting information about risk factors for Covid-19 with a focus on vitamin D deficiency to address the absence of research in this area. Any UK resident aged above 16 is eligible to participate.“There are no clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent Covid ongoing anywhere in the world to my knowledge and clinical evidence for its use to reduce risk of acute respiratory infections is mixed,” Martineau added.However, studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation is safe and protects against acute respiratory tract infection. Higher levels of melanin in the skin lead to lower levels of vitamin D creation which are exacerbated in countries which have less sunlight. This can cause immune systems to be weaker.PHE has acknowledged reports about vitamin D potentially reducing the risk of coronavirus but said there was not enough evidence to support this.It has since April recommended all people take 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to maintain bone and muscle health owing to concerns they may not be getting enough sunlight, particularly during the lockdown.UK vitamin D advice is focused on musculoskeletal health conditions such as rickets and there are fears that its effect on general immune systems has been overlooked. On 3 June the Scottish government specifically recommended people from minority ethnic groups with dark skin to take the supplement.Across the UK, as many as 750 NHS staff have received free wellness packs including liposomal vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc from a voluntary initiative called the Frontline Immune Support Team, and there has been some frustration that a more holistic approach to the pandemic has not been implemented.Singapore general hospital reportedly routinely gives coronavirus patients aged over 50 a mix of vitamin D, magnesium and vitamin B12, while countries which have recently had summers have generally been less affected by the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f28c1c8ee1eea07161d9167940e3f06d62e785cb/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b32875275f6fafe8d25315d53d8a1617 1440w","title":"coronavirus live news brazil adds record 35000 covid 19 cases as infections surge in six us states latest updates","story":"WHO says hydroxychloroquine showed no benefit Germany extends ban on large events for four months Beijing raises alert level and grounds hundreds of flightsHere’s a summary of the latest developments:Roche Holding AG’s Actemra did not improve symptoms in patients with early-stage Covid-19 pneumonia, scientists conducting a study of the drug in Italy have said. The revelation raises questions about the potential of the Swiss drugmakers’ rheumatoid arthritis drug to treat the infection.The study compared patients who received anti-inflammation drug Actemra to those given standard treatment, and concluded that Actemra did not reduce severe respiratory symptoms, intensive care visits, or death.According to Reuters, the trial ended early after enrolling 126 patients, about one third of the expected number, according to a press release issued by the groups that conducted the study.In the US, the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has accused the incumbent Donald Trump of “surrendering” to the pandemic and failing to stay prepared for a resurgence that could put a US economic recovery at risk.American people sacrificed so much to fight this virus ... we may lose some the progress we’ve begun to make. All because he’s lost interest. Now he’s just flat surrendering the fight.Trump is eager to reopen the economy and resume political campaigning even as the number of cases has started to rise again, with record increases reported this week in the states of Oklahoma, Texas and Oregon.The president is planning his first rally since people were forced to stay at home three months ago in heavily Republican Oklahoma, over the objections of public health officials. Biden said:He’s so eager to get back to campaign rallies that he*s putting people at risk.Citizens and residents of the United Arab Emirates will be allowed to travel to countries deemed low-risk for catching the virus from next Tuesday, local officials have said.Prospective travellers must test negative and must quarantine on their return to the UAE for up to 14 days, a spokesman for the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority has said.Saif Al Dhaheri said airport authorities will check travellers for symptoms. Those with a fever or showing respiratory problems will be isolated and barred from travel.Dhaheri did not give a list of countries for each risk category, but said all travel to high-risk countries would remain banned.Travel to medium-risk countries would be allowed on a case-by-case basis, for people seeking health treatment, visiting immediate family or those on military, diplomatic or official business.Sudan has extended the lockdown in the state of Khartoum to 29 June as it tries to curb the virus’ spread, its Security and Defence Council has said. Khartoum state, including the capital, is the Arab African country’s most populous.Curfew hours will remain unchanged, from 3pm until 6am (CAT), the council said after approving the recommendations of its Supreme Committee for Health Emergencies.Sudan will start a process to bring back stranded expatriates through flights and border crossings starting from Sunday, the statement said.Those who do not have medical certificates proving that they are not carrying the virus will be transferred to quarantine centres until they can be tested, it added.Last week, Sudan extended the closure of airports to international and internal scheduled commercial flights until 28 June. The country had reported 7,435 cases as of Saturday, including 468 deaths.The borders of more than a dozen countries in West Africa could be reopened within weeks under proposals from government ministers there.The measures could be in place in the first half of July, with travellers from other countries with low or controlled levels of coronavirus spread allowed in by the end of the month.Members of the 15-country ECOWAS trade bloc have imposed varying levels of travel restrictions in response to the pandemic, with many shutting their borders entirely.The new proposal, contained in an ECOWAS summary of a virtual meeting last week of foreign ministers and trade ministers, called for coordinated efforts to re-open cross-border trade.It said a first phase consisting of opening up domestic air and land transport should be implemented this month. Many governments in the region have already begun to do so.A second phase, involving the opening of land, air and maritime borders within the region, should happen by 15 July at the latest.A third phase, involving the opening of air and land borders to “countries with low and controlled levels of Covid-19 contamination rates”, should occur by 31 July but will depend on the evolution of the pandemic, the report said.France’s death toll rose by 28 to 29,575 on Wednesday, a figure more in line with the current trend after a spike in deaths on Tuesday due to the inclusion of weekly data for nursing homes.Yet the number of new confirmed cases was at a four-day high of 458, at 158,174, and slightly above the daily average of 434 seen over the last seven days.On Tuesday, the death toll was up by 111 but that figure included 73 fatalities in nursing homes. If only hospital deaths are taken into account, the average daily increase stands at 26.France’s health ministry said that the number of people in hospital fell by 268 to 10,267 and the number of people in intensive care fell by 48 to 772. Both numbers have been on a downtrend for about 10 weeks.An official study of patients in the US city Atlanta has found that black patients are more likely to be hospitalised than white patients, highlighting racial disparities in the country’s healthcare system.The researchers found such an association even when they controlled for underlying conditions such as diabetes. This suggested that other factors like healthcare access or the possibility of bias might explain the higher rates.Hospitalised patients tended to be older, male, black, and have underlying conditions, said the researchers. They added that black Americans were more likely to be frontline industry or essential workers, raising their risks for infection.Apart from age, race and underlying conditions, lack of insurance, smoking and obesity were independently associated with the likelihood of hospitalisation for the 531 Atlanta patients studied, researchers said.The Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández has been hospitalised for Covid-19 and is being treated for pneumonia, a health official has said, shortly after the Central American leader’s diagnosis was revealed.While his condition is serious enough to require specialised hospital care, including receiving medicine via an intravenous drip, the president is generally in good health, said Francis Contreras, a spokesman for Honduran health agency SINAGER.The US has suffered 722 more deaths and registered 27,975 new cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That takes the official totals to 116,862 and 2,132,321, respectively.The cheap steroid British researchers believe can help save lives should be used only for the most serious cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.The WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said research was at last providing “green shoots of hope”.Trial results announced on Tuesday showed dexamethasone, a generic drug used since the 1960s to reduce inflammation in diseases such as arthritis, cut death rates by around a third among the most severely ill patients admitted to hospital.The head of the WHO’s emergencies programme, Dr Mike Ryan, said the drug should only be used in the cases where it has been shown to help.It is exceptionally important in this case, that the drug is reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients who can benefit from this drug clearly.Right, I’m handing over to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson in London so I will leave you with this summary.

However, he said keeping people 2m apart was tougher for live performances and theaters “so that’s going to be trickier but if it is safe to do so, I will do it”.Under the Government’s Covid-19 roadmap, theatres, cinemas, nightclubs and casinos can reopen from July 20th but only if social distancing measures can be implemented.Mr Varadkar and Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan on Tuesday announced a €25 million package of supports to artists and arts organisations and resources for museums and culture workers as they prepare for the unwinding of coronavirus restrictions. The funding is in addition to money previously allocated to the sector.They said a total of €20 million was being allocated to the Arts Council, bringing its total for the year to €100 million. A further €5 million was being made available for securing the future of cultural and museum spaces and the production of digital art and online performances.“Over the last few months we have had many days of sorrow and suffering. In times like this we see the true value of culture to society - the books, the films, the songs, the plays - all the different forms of culture that entertain as well as enlighten,” Mr Varadkar said.“The pandemic hasn’t been easy for our artists and cultural institutions, and I know their livelihoods have been hit hard. So many events have been cancelled, so many places have been forced to close. “The Government wants to recognise how important culture is to our lives and it wants to match its words with actions.”Ms Madigan said that the arts sector had “suffered more than most in the crisis and will continue to experience difficult and challenging times long after other sectors have returned to work”.“Despite this, I am confident that artists and arts organisations across the country can weather this storm and emerge with all the wonderful creativity that is its hallmark.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4281840.1592429107!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two hour time slots in pubs to be allowed under final guidelines","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFollowing pressure from industry representatives, the seating time in pubs has changed. Photograph: iStockPubs intending to open from the end of the month can provide a two hour time slot for customers under final guidelines for the industry.They will also be asked to collect the contact information of drinkers.Businesses will also be allowed to implement a one-metre physical distancing guideline in “permitted controlled environments.”Following pressure from industry representatives, the seating time in pubs has changed from 90 minutes to 105 minutes with an additional 15 minutes between bookings, which is 2 hours in total.“The 15 minutes has been added to allow for adequate cleaning and to ensure customers leave and enter without mixing,” the guidelines state.Businesses will now also be required to collect the contact information of just the “party lead”. Previously, the original HPSC guidance stated that this should be collected for the full group.The guidance says that where at all practical workers in pubs should provide services to only one gathering and should not move between different function rooms.It says toilets should not be used simultaneously by multiple gatherings. Pubs will also be asked to make regular announcements to remind customers to follow social distancing advice and wash their hands regularly and will be asked to place plexiglass barriers at tills and counters.Customers will also have to be seated at a table except when using the toilet, paying and departing.Pubs will be required to serve a “substantial meal” for which it would be reasonable to charge not less than €9. Physical distancing of at least one metre should be maintained between people seated at tables.Pre booking will be encouraged as much as possible and a text may be sent to remind the customer to stay away if unwell.A distance of two metres and a minimum of one metre should be maintained between employees. Where two metres is not possible “all other measures to protect employees should be in place,” the guidance says.Previously Dr Tony Holohan, the State’s chief medical officer, had said pubs operating as restaurants would not mean several people meeting up “for a few pints and having a packet of peanuts”.Pubs reopening as restaurants would not need a restaurant licence to do so, the Government has said.Fáilte Ireland chief executive Paul Kelly said the guidelines are “intended to provide clarity to businesses so that they can reopen safely on June 29th.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Only contact details of one group member will be required under HPSC planThe children were due to be resettled in March, but it was postponed due to Covid-19Move unlikely to affect any cases pending before Special Criminal CourtAward can help young people find their voice and challenge discrimination around raceLorry driver (31) uninjured after vehicle collided with car at Dunmoe, NavanPsychiatrists record a \u0026lsquoswell\u0026rsquo in people presenting because of self-harm and suicidal ideation, new onset depression and anxietyKerry, Donegal and Sligo record no new Covid-19 cases in four weeksFive healthcare workers among 764 coronavirus fatalities, statistics agency reportsDeparting High Court president is the second longest serving judge in the Irish courtsEating chicken korma, cottage pie \u0026lsquogives no extra protection\u0026rsquo against Covid-19, D\u0026aacuteil toldCouncil to introduce one-way system for cars along coast to facilitate \u0026lsquodramatic shift to cycling\u0026rsquoDepartment of Social Protection advises public not to click or reply to the textJudge urges drivers to take care at junctions and look out for cyclists and pedestriansSharing the Vision policy replaces Vision for Change which expired in 2016Irish Rail says centre will allow the modernisation of our rail network and enhance the provision of customer informationMinister says reproduction rate estimated at 0.7 and remains stableDraft guidelines propose reopening pubs and restaurants for 90-minute visitsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4281830.1592427381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eight children from greek refugee camp resettled in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Children Katherine Zappone said she was ‘very relieved that the young people tested negative for Covid-19 and were able to travel’.  File photograph: Damien EagersThe Eight children from a refugee camp in Greece arrived in Dublin on Wednesday as part of a resettlement programme, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has announced.The children, who have been separated from their families, were brought to the country under the International Refugee Protection Programme, which is managed by the Department of Justice and Equality. They will now go into the care of Tusla, the child and family agency.Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr Katherine Zappone, welcomed the young people’s arrival, following delays relating to the coronavirus pandemic.“I am delighted that at last we can welcome these children, whose arrival here was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Minister Zappone said. “I am very relieved that the young people tested negative for Covid-19 and were able to travel today.”Preparation for the transfer of the young people began in September 2019, when Tusla led a mission to Athens and the eight children were assessed, screened and approved for resettlement. Arrangements for the children were being processed and their arrival had been expected in late March. However, all refugee transport and resettlement programmes were temporarily suspended in mid-March because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the transfer could not be completed.Minister Zappone commended Tusla for the detailed planning to ensure the safe transfer of the young people: “I know Tusla has developed a detailed and comprehensive plan to care for these young people in their new home, where they will quarantine. They will be received into Tusla care and will have a chance to adjust to the very different circumstances in which they will now be living,” Minister Zappone added.“I want to thank Tusla for the additional efforts made to ensure all public health advice is adhered to and that the young people, and those caring for them, are protected as they settle into their new home.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4281468.1592402809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il hears claims tds used racism to get elected","story":"Some TDs have used racism to get elected to the Dáil and “that needs to be called out”, Green Party TD Joe O’Brien has said.  Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen TD Joe O’Brien: There are people in the House who have used racism to get into the Dáil. File photograph: The Some TDs have used racism to get elected to the Dáil and “that needs to be called out”, Green Party TD Joe O’Brien has said.During a Dáil debate on combatting racism and supporting inclusion, Mr O’Brien said racism is imbued in every aspect of Irish society.“It’s everywhere and if we’re all really honest we’ve all used it at some stage in our lives. I’ve used it I’m ashamed to say and I think everyone of us has.”The Dublin Fingal TD said: “There are certainly some people in this House not here today from what I can tell who have used it to get into this House and that needs to be called out.”Not identifying any TD, he said: “Only a couple of weeks ago a member of this House used it in a parliamentary question to get attention and that needs to be called out.”Reading out statements from people who experienced racism, he quoted one person who suffered racist abuse: “Certain parents didn’t want their kids to be friends with an N-word child. I remember being told that I was here stealing your houses and social welfare money and to go back to my country.” Mr O’Brien said: “This very line of abuse that relates to people coming in and using our resources - a TD only couple of weeks ago in this House used (that) in a parliamentary question that was asked”.Labour TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin also hit out at politicians about racism and a Cabinet member on comments about Travellers.“We have Deputies in this House who have said that asylum seekers are freeloaders, blackguards and hoodlums, that asylum seekers need to be deprogrammed and that asylum seekers are here to sponge off the system. We have two members of a governing party who have been on the wrong side of anti-Traveller literature controversies, one of whom sits at Cabinet.”Independent TD Thomas Pringle claimed racism was being used for election purposes. He said: “It has also played a part in some members winning a seat here, even a member of the Government.“It may not have been as blatant as some of the comments but the intention is the same to make political gain out of people’s differences.”He said the new government could make sure the Seanad was representative of the population as a whole by appointing Travellers and people of colour.Opening the debate, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said comprehensive preparation has been undertaken to ensure that new legislation to combat racism and incitement to hatred is robust and effective. “It was also very important to me that new legislation would be informed by the lived experience of those who suffer from abuse or attacks motivated by hate,” he said.Mr Flanagan also said Garda ersity recruitment campaigns had resulted in 67 people from 19 nationalities becoming gardaí since last year, including nationals of Brazil, China, India, Iraq, Nigeria, Russia and South Africa.Minister of State for Equality David Stanton said a committee established to develop an anti-racism strategy and action plan, chaired by Professor Caroline Fennell of UCC, will hold its first meeting on Thursday, produce an interim report within three months and a full report at the end of the year.Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins said local authority structures should be used to promote better integration of immigrant, minority, LGBT and Traveller communities because councils had not done enough to “step up to the plate” and integrate migrants with the wider community.Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said “the idea that someone does not belong, is not from here and, therefore, should be treated differently” is racism.He said that “opposition to Traveller accommodation, including the sale of public land to prevent such accommodation being provided, is telling those families that they do not belong and is ultimately racist”. And he added that the segregation of asylum applicants into wholly inappropriate direct provision is racist. Independent TD Denis Naughten referred to “institutional racism” and said that in 2007 he highlighted the cases of 443 children who “went missing from State care and were never found”, saying “nobody cared” because they were from Africa and Asia.Mr Naughten said that at the height of the political focus on historical residential abuse in industrial schools, “that very same dereliction of care on behalf of the State was continuing to allow those who exploited and abused children of different colours and nationalities to go on undetected. That is institutional racism”. He said suspected child victims of trafficking ranging in age from as young as three to 17 had been transported to Ireland from foreign countries for “forced labour, begging, domestic servitude, sexual exploitation and forced marriage”. Independent TD Michael Collins said a rural resettlement programme should be launched “where at least two families in direct provision should be given the chance to live in every rural community in our country”, in some of the many vacant houses in towns and villages.But in the wake of the anti-racism protests after the killing by police in Minneapolis of George Floyd and the toppling of statues of slave traders, Mr Collins criticised suggestions that plaques and statues might be removed.“Have we now become so politically correct that we are going to knock down our statues and sculptures and erase our history? The next thing we know our books will be burned to censor our history, culture and religion.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4281332.1592391734!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party negotiators at odds over merits of government deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Green Party’s Ossian Smyth (left), pictured with other members of the party’s negotiating team Roderic O’Gorman and Neasa Hourigan at Leinster House last month. Photograph Nick Bradshaw  The Dublin Central TD Neasa Hourigan, the Green Party’s finance spokeswoman, told The  she has “considerable” concerns about the proposed economic strategy in the programme for government.Ms Hourigan was one of three TDs who abstained when the deal was voted on by the Green parliamentary party earlier this week. The deal was ultimately endorsed by the parliamentary party and will now go to the party’s membership for ratification.One of five Green TDs chosen by her party to steer programme-for-government talks, she said she was unable “to square the circle” of reducing the deficit and allowing tax breaks while investing in climate action and services over the five weeks of talks between the three parties.She was speaking as another member of the Green Party’s negotiating team - Dún Laoghaire TD Ossian Smyth - cautioned against being “wedded to an ideological approach”.Contrasting his own stance with some of the Green Party’s younger activists, he told RTÉ’s Prime Time: “I don’t hate the people in the other parties. It’s not part of my identity that ‘I am me’ and, you know, ‘I’ll never speak to these people’… I worked very closely with the other parties over the last few weeks and part of this was not just to discuss policy but also to establish trust.”Explaining her position, Ms Hourigan said: “We worked really, really hard over the last few weeks, and did our best to get as good a deal as we could. Now it is for the members to decide.“Myself personally, I have concerns on housing, around the provision of public housing, affordability and the idea that public land should remain in public hands.“I have considerable concerns around the economic strategy, including year-on-year deficit reduction, tax breaks up to and above €4 billion and no tax increases over the lifetime of the government, while promising to invest in things like climate action and basic services. We have discussed this for five weeks and I still can’t square that circle.“Are the environment issues enough and strong enough and binding enough to allow for underachievement in housing, social justice and finance? It is up to the members to decide.”A number of prominent Greens including Mayo general election candidate Saoirse McHugh and Cllr Lorna Bogue in Cork have already rejected the programme.Cllr Bogue told Prime Time on Tuesday night that the youth branch of the party was “very policy oriented” and there were insufficient commitments in the deal. She said the target of reducing carbon emissions by 7 per cent would not be achieved within the lifetime of the government and “it seems as though the most we are going to get for the first five years is 4 or 4.5 per cent”.Asked about her stance on the programme, Mr Smyth said: “I don’t know if I can convince Lorna but I spent today my ringing my members, and they were very enthusiastic about this.”He added: “Lorna is part of the young wing of the party. All of our parties have youth wings. They are passionate and vigorous and they have a purity of purpose. I’m not wedded to an ideological approach.”On Wednesday, Green Party MEP Ciarán Cuffe said that his party should “grasp this nettle” and the extraordinary opportunity to promote a green agenda “even if Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are not our natural bedfellows”.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney show, Mr Cuffe said that the Green Party “can’t sit out this one” until it found a perfect political alignment. “We can stand on the sidelines saying ‘do something’ or roll up our sleeves and get in.”Over his three decades in politics he had built relationships on all side of the political spectrum and had huge admiration for people in the two other political parties, he said. His colleagues “have to have trust” in their opposite numbers in the Oireachtas.“We can’t wait, we can’t sit this one out. I don’t think the electorate would thank us,” he added.Grassroots membersThe three parties have begun the process of seeking the approval of their party organisations and grassroots members for the deal.While sources in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are confident of winning internal endorsement, Green TDs admit that party leader Eamon Ryan faces a battle to get the two-thirds approval from the party membership that his party’s constitution requires.However, several senior Green sources say the deal stands a strong chance of being ratified after deputy leader Catherine Martin signalled her support for it. Some party sources said they would wait to see how vigorously she will campaign for the deal.Fianna Fáil will hold online meetings in all constituencies, which will include members of the negotiating team and party leader Micheál Martin. Justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan said he would back the deal, and said he hoped to serve as a minister in a new government.Fine Gael will hold a special delegate convention on Sunday via Facebook, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will also hold conference calls with public representatives and there will be four regional Facebook Live events.Meanwhile, an Ipsos MRBI poll suggests that both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil voters are strongly in favour of forming the three-party coalition with the Greens.Asked about their preferences for government formation, 53 per cent of Fianna Fáil voters said they favoured the three-party coalition, while 55 per cent of Fine Gael voters were in favour – making the proposed coalition by far the most popular choice for voters of the two parties."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Batons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279823.1592246043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu prepares to knuckle down for summer of brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson participates in a video-conference call on Monday with European Council president Charles Michel, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Parliament president David Sassoli and the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Photograph: Andrew Parsons10 Downing StreetAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union is preparing to redouble efforts and work through the summer to hammer out a deal with Britain following a meeting between prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, held a video conference with the British leader to take stock of the lack of progress in the talks, with just six months remaining before barriers to trade between Britain and its neighbours make an abrupt return, after decades spent removing them.The political leadership on both sides sent the message to their negotiators to go back over the areas where they had encountered stumbling blocks and try again to see if they can inch their way to a compromise that would avoid the most drastic ‘no trade deal’ option.“We agreed . . . that new momentum was required,” Ms von der Leyen said following the meeting.The mood in Brussels was upbeat towards the prospects of reaching a deal following the meeting, with those working close to the negotiations expecting a summer of late-night marathon talks that would likely run through the traditional holiday period.\u0026nbspBritain had initially briefed that it would abandon attempts to find a deal at this stage if it felt insufficient progress had been made, and focus its work instead on preparing for an automatic switch from January 1st to World Trade Organisation terms – a global default system of tariffs expected to cause a significant blow to trade.London’s shift away from this position and commitment to the talks has been taken as an indication that a deal can be found.Joint statementIn a joint statement following the meeting, both sides committed to “create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020”.“The parties underlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship which would work in the interests of the citizens of the union and of the United Kingdom, ” the joint statement read. “They also confirmed their commitment to the full and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”The two sides have agreed to six rounds of negotiations between June 29th and August 21st, held physically if possible and alternating between London and Brussels. Since February, negotiations have been over video conference because of the pandemic, ruling out informal side chats that often help find common ground.Sticking points include fishing rights and fair competition provisions for business.On policing and security co-operation, a way through could be possible, as the EU is open to workarounds through the international policing co-operation body Interpol. However, this would be a far more distant kind of co-operation than once hoped for.The British side has bridled at insistence by the EU that the deal should contain a commitment to uphold the Paris Climate Accord, insisting that this goes far beyond the stipulations of past trade deals. But in the EU’s view, modern-day trade deals have evolved to include such commitments, and they are appropriate because Britain is a like-minded country that has signed up to the agreement anyway.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Stephane LemoutonAFPIreland has been elected to a seat on the UN Security Council in the first round of voting, in a major boost for the country’s foreign policy credentials.Ireland secured 128 votes – exactly the two-thirds majority needed to qualify. Norway was elected to other seat in the “Western Europe and other states” category with 130 votes.A total of 191 countries voted in the first round of voting which began at 9am in New York (around 2pm Irish time) and concluded at lunchtime. Ambassadors from each member state voted by secret ballot at set times due to coronavirus restrictions.Ireland’s two-year term will begin on January 1st, 2021.Ireland has held a seat on the council three times before. The last occasion was in 2001 in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks.The influential 15-member body has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It can establish peacekeeping operations, enact international sanctions, and authorise military action.France, Britain, the US, Russia and China are the five permanent members of the UN body, with the remaining 10 seats rotating among other member states who serve for two-year terms. The five permanent members have the power to veto decisions.President Michael D Higgins congratulated all involved in Ireland’s “principled” campaign and said the achivevment was a cause for celebration.“The support Ireland has received vindicates the decision to run a campaign that did not avoid the issues that are urgent a campaign that engaged with global issues, such as peace-building and peacekeeping, the elimination of global poverty, the strengthening of multilateralism, and reform of the United Nations. ”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney both welcomed the result.At a press conference in Government Buildings both said Ireland had “punched above its weight”.Mr Varadkar said it had been a “tough election” and the contest against Canada and Norway made it the “group of death”.“We have a presence in the world and we are a country that punches above our weight,” said Mr Varadkar.He said the fact that Ireland was the only member of the EU vying for the position was a factor, as was our relationship with Africa and the work done by the Defence Forces with the UN. Mr Varadkar said that Ireland’s role and stance on the Middle East was also an important factor.“For a small country we have a lot of influence,” said Mr Coveney who said that a lot of countries respected the good standing that Ireland has had.Both said that the €800,000 spent on the campaign was money well spent, and said it was half that spent by Norway and Canada.Asked about the campaign spend, Mr Coveney said: “If Ireland is a country that is serious about impacting on global decision-making, sitting around the table with 14 others, we needed to be serious about winning a campaign like this. It was money well spent to ensure that Irish values and Irish foreign policy is shaping global decision-making for the next two years. I hope that we can save lives and raise awareness of (vulnerable peoples).He also said that Ireland had a reform agenda and would particularly like to see change in the veto of the five permanent members of the council.Mr Varadkar said sitting at the top table, Ireland could do a lot of good in the world.“We are a small country that has a big presence and is a force of good,” he said.Ireland’s ambassador to the United Nations Geraldine Byrne-Nason played a significant role in Irish efforts in New York.In the most recent debate on the UN Security Council election, Ms Byrne-Nason said that “effective multilateralism” was at the heart of Irish foreign policy.Highlighting Ireland’s status as an “independent and neutral country,” she said that Irish people were “bridge-builders by nature”.During the debate, Ms Byrne-Nason also highlighted Ireland’s support for Palestinians, expressing “deep concern” at the threat of annexation that was expressed by the new Israeli government.“We have put the Palestinian question at the heart of foreign policy. We have long advocated a two-state solution,” she said.The outcome will be a blow to Canadian leader Justin Trudeau. Mr Trudeau announced that Canada would compete for a seat in 2016 – a relatively short time-frame in which to lobby for membership of the body. Canada’s most recent attempt to secure one of the 10 rotating seats ended in failure in 2010 – a move that was widely seen as a reaction to the conservative government led by Stephen Harper at the time.While the bid for a UN Security Council seat was very much the brainchild of Mr Trudeau, the Canadian leader’s standing has been weakened somewhat by a series of scandals, including the emergence of photographs of him in “black face” and a government contract scandal.India, which ran unopposed in the Asia-Pacific group, and Mexico, the only competitors in the Latin America and Caribbean group, were also elected. Neither of the two countries running in the Africa group – Kenya and Djibouti – received the required majority, so a second round will now be held.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

This is what they intend to convey to the Independent Commission of Inquiry.“Both of these decisions were reached after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection, and with the full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world.”The statement came after the majority of both undergraduates and postgraduates studying at Oriel had this week voted in favour of the statue being removed. Carole Souter CBE, the current Master of St Cross College and former Chief Executive of the National Lottery Heritage Fund, was immediately appointed as the independent Chair of the inquiry - which it said would continue “at pace” and report back by the end of the year.As well as dealing with “the issue of the Rhodes legacy”, the inquiry will also explore “how to improve access and attendance of BAME undergraduate, graduate students and faculty, together with a review of how the College’s 21st Century commitment to ersity can sit more easily with its past”.The statement added that the inquiry would “approach a number of  iniduals drawn from the worlds of academia, education policy, law, politics and journalism, adding:  “The commission is intending to draw upon the greatest possible breadth and depth of experience, opinion and background.”It said written and oral evidence will be taken from a broad range of stakeholders from Oxford and the country, including students, representatives of Rhodes Must Fall and Oxford City council, as well as alumni of Oxford and Oriel and citizens of the city.“The Governing Body believes that this decision will allow a serious, appropriate and productive resolution of a complex series of issues,” the statement added. The statement came after Oriel’s Governing body met for several hours on Wednesday afternoon amid rising tensions in Oxford following the recent Black Lives Matter protests. Students have been writing dozens of letters to vice-chancellor Prof Louise Richardson and College heads demanding that institutional racism be tackled. On Wednesday, Prof Richardson was criticised by 14 of her university’s own professors who accused her of making “unwarranted claims” about Nelson Mandela after she quoted the former President of South Africa as saying: “Hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment.”Writing for the , the dons warned Prof Richardson that she should not “presume to speak for black students or people of colour”, saying it was inappropriate for her to “ventriloquise” the late anti-apartheid leader. Prof Richardson hinted that Mr Mandela might not support the Rhodes Must Fall campaign because “he was a man of deep nuance who recognised complex problems for what they were.” Pointing to a speech given by Mr Mandela in 2003 to launch the Mandela Rhodes Foundation, a partnership with the Rhodes Trust to offer scholarships to African students, she said: “He said that we have to acknowledge our past but focus on the future.”The letter was signed by Oxford academics including Robert Gildea, a professor of modern history, Elleke Boehmer, a professor of world literature and Miles Trendi, an associate professor in African politics and Faisal Devji, a professor of India history. A separate open letter was sent to the vice-chancellor this week from the university’s black and ethnic minority staff network, which accused her of “limited and inadequate” messages to staff about countering institutional racism. Last night, Oriel students Neil Misra and Swaraj Dash, who continued the Rhodes Must Fall campaign that started in 2015, told the : We are absolutely delighted. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"companies britain linked slave trade say today","story":"Greene received nearly £500,000 in today\u0027s money when he surrendered rights to three plantations in the West Indies.There is also evidence that other partners of RBSG predecessors may have been part owners of ships involved in slave trading voyages during the 18th and 19th centuries.Layla Moran, a challenger for the Liberal Democrat leadership, said she would be writing to the bosses of companies highlighted in the UCL database, urging them to make donations to BAME causes.How Greene King is linked to the slave trade:How RBS is linked to the slave trade:How Lloyds Banking Group is linked to the slave trade:How RSA Insurance is linked to the slave trade:How Lloyds of London is linked to the slave trade:What Lloyds of London says today:How P\u0026ampO is linked to the slave trade:How Danske Bank is linked to the slave trade:How Barclays is linked to the slave trade:How HSBC is linked to the slave trade:More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont left left determine terms pms race audit","story":"After two weeks of antiracism protests, Boris Johnson wants a commission to report on wider inequalities in Britain. The usual suspects have condemned the Prime Minister for not “doing something” immediately. But do what?The ostensible purpose of the commission is to examine racial disparities. Already, “ersity” campaigners are demanding to set its terms of reference. They do not want an honest, fact-driven study, but confirmation of their existing belief that structural injustice and a hierarchy of oppression determine everything.There is good news. Munira Mirza, a sharp thinker and now policy director inside No 10, who is setting up this commission, is not a hostage to the simple narratives of victimhood. The composition of the Government itself disproves the patronising idea that all achievement must be viewed through the prism of “oppression”. Rishi Sunak, Kemi Badenoch, Priti Patel – none of them sees their success as determined by the ethnic group to which they happen to belong by accident of birth.The commission looks like it will not repeat some of the mistakes of its predecessors, either. It is reportedly set to examine the obstacles that face members of the white working class, for example. By the age of five, white working class boys are 13 per cent behind disadvantaged black boys and 23 per cent behind disadvantaged Asian girls in phonics. They are 40 per cent less likely to go to university than their black counterparts.Yet it would be a wasted opportunity if this were to become yet another data gathering exercise. That would be to miss the significance of the past few weeks. There are much larger issues at stake.To take one example, how did the evil killing of George Floyd in Minnesota result in British citizens attacking our own police outside No 10 and desecrating the Cenotaph? Eighty-four per cent of British people polled this week said you don’t need to be white to be British, up from 55 per cent just a few years ago. Yet an ever louder group in society is pulling away from this enlightened view of an inclusive Britishness.Unleashed from university campuses, they see themselves as members of tribes based on centuries of oppression. Being gay, trans, black, female, or Muslim matters more than anything else. This Balkanisation of identity is, in part, driving the momentum against Churchill as well as the ongoing calls for “decolonising history”. This is not a matter simply of economics or race, as the Left suggests. The ties that bind us are being broken. Boris’s challenge is to fix them.Thucydides recalls Pericles saying that “we Athenians pride ourselves in being free and tolerant in our private lives, in public matters obedient to the law.” Therein lies the secret of Western civilisation.We have secular laws within a jurisdiction of land that allows for liberty. This ancient freedom, a bond between free and equal citizens, must not be broken. Nothing better replaces it. It is not a bond of race or religion, but loyalty to the same nation state, and love for its land, laws, language, and culture.But it will take leadership for this enlightened view of national identity to triumph over the politics of ision. Boris and his commission must take this debate and address it with patriotism, justice and courage.

According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he threw himself \u0027with enormous vigour into representing the interests of the West Indian slave proprietors at a critical juncture of their affairs\u0027.Greene handed control of his Suffolk brewery to his son Edward in 1836, and it was renamed Greene King after merging with Frederick King\u0027s nearby brewery in 1887.Yet on the page of the company\u0027s website devoted to its 200 years of rich heritage, no mention is made of Benjamin Greene\u0027s slaving past.He said: It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s.We don\u0027t have all the answers, so that is why we are taking time to listen and learn from all the voices, including our team members and charity partners, as we strengthen our ersity and inclusion work.James Cheyne, a director of the National Bank of Scotland, which later became part of RBS, received a share of three claims over estates in Tobago, worth £375,141 today.In 2006, RBS\u0027s US arm, Citizens and Charter One, pledged $5 million to support local economic and educational initiatives for African-American communities. A further $2 million will pay for scholarships for African-Americans over the next four years.On Wednesday, a spokesman said RBS has looked into its past links with slavery very extensively and thoroughly over the past 15 years.Eight former companies associated with Lloyds Banking Group also have links to claimants or beneficiaries in the UCL database.His son-in law, Sir Anthony Lechmere, was awarded compensation for 286 enslaved people in the Virgin Islands, totalling £489,985 in today\u0027s money, and was an investor in the bank.A Lloyds spokesman said: Like any institution that is so interwoven with our country\u0027s history, we must acknowledge and learn from our past.One of them – William Tetlow Hibbert, who founded the bank in 1839 – was paid £4.5 million in today\u0027s money for compensation over nine claims relations to estates in Jamaica, two as a mortgagee.A Barclays spokesman said: The history of Barclays, like other institutions, is being examined following recent events. We can\u0027t change what\u0027s gone before us, only how we go forward.HSBC is linked to the compensation scheme through George Pollard, the first manager of London Joint Stock Bank, which was later absorbed by Midland Bank and eventually merged into HSBC.Danske Bank said it had a zero-tolerance policy against all forms of discrimination, disrespectful behaviour, bullying, and harassment of any kind.Insurer Lloyd\u0027s of London, with founder subscriber Simon Fraser, was the former owner of the Castle Bruce estate in Dominica, which was handed compensation totalling £397,451 in today\u0027s money.We will provide financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for black and minority ethnic groups.Modern-day insurance giant RSA Insurance also has links through the database through five company directors and a governor of London Assurance – which was merged into Sun Insurance in 1959 and eventually RSA Insurance in 2008 – who received money from the database.An RSA spokesman said: There are aspects of that history that don\u0027t reflect the values we hold today.Shipping company P\u0026ampO, now owned by DP World, can also trace its routes to slavery in the database through Joseph Christopher Ewart, who later became a director of P\u0026ampO Steam Navigation Co and received £334,336.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government finished paying uks slavery debt 2015","story":"The huge debt, named the Slavery Abolition Act (1835) Loan, ultimately became an undated gilt which could not be repaid until 1957.In a Freedom of Information response in 2018, HM Treasury said: Money borrowed to fund the Slavery Abolition Act (1835) was fully repaid in 2015.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"les mis hamilton shut 2021 cameron mackintosh blames impossible","story":"Sir Cameron Mackintosh has cancelled his West End shows until 2021 and plans redundancies on all productions, blaming the Government for maintaining “the impossible constraints of social distancing”.Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera - London’s longest-running musicals - will not open this year and nor will Mary Poppins or Hamilton, putting the jobs of performers and production staff under threat.Sir Cameron said he had been forced to take the “heartbreaking” steps due to an absence of help or information from the Government, and insisted that his theatres cannot open until social distancing has ended.The Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, announced yesterday that the culture sector would reopen on July 4. But he admitted that it would be all but impossible for theatres to operate while social distancing was in place, even if the two-metre rule was reduced to one metre, because they operate on “wafer-thin profit margins” and need to play to nearly-full houses.He said: “I understand the need for all of these venues to return with people in them and, indeed, eventually without social distancing. But that can only be done if the public health allows it to happen.”In his statement, Sir Cameron said: “Despite the Government engaging with the desperate pleas from everyone in the theatre industry, so far there has been no tangible practical support beyond offers to go into debt, which I don’t want to do.“Their inability to say when the impossible constraints of social distancing will be lifted makes it equally impossible for us to properly plan for whatever the new future is.“This has forced me to take drastic steps to ensure that I have the resources for my business to survive and enable my shows and theatre to reopen next year when we are permitted to.”The theatre industry has been devastated by the pandemic. Nimax, which owns six West End venues, has announced that it is to cut up to a third of its workforce.Lord Lloyd Webber does not plan to reopen his theatres until social distancing ends. He has urged the Government to follow the example of his Phantom of the Opera production in Seoul, South Korea, which has been playing to capacity audiences of 1,600. Audience members have their temperatures taken at the door and wear face masks But Mr Dowden appeared to dismiss that during the Downing Street briefing, saying: “Social distancing plays a very important part in reducing the spread of the disease so I think we may be looking at some time for theatres to return.”The theatre union, Bectu, criticised Mr Dowden’s response. Its head, Philippa Childs, said: “It is incredibly disappointing that the Culture Secretary arrived at the press conference empty-handed with no rescue plan for the sector.”Sir Cameron has begun a redundancy consultation period with employees and he said: “This decision is heartbreaking for me, as I am sure it is for my employees, as everyone who has worked with me over the last 50 years, on or off the stage, knows how much I care about what I do and how I do it.”The producer and theatre owner said: “I have no investors or venture capital backing, everything is funded by me personally and already my companies’ considerable reserves have been massively reduced by the complete closure of our industry everywhere.Everything I have made has come from the theatre and everything I have has gone back into these magnificent historic buildings that I have lovingly restored and the spectacular productions I have painstakingly insisted remain in tip-top shape wherever they play in the world - resulting in my being one of the biggest employers in the theatre.The commercial theatre provides billions of pounds of revenue to the economy. It is time this is recognised and the Government takes action to ensure this priceless resource at which the British people excel is helped to survive.“Without our theatres being ablaze with life, London cannot properly reopen as one of the world’s greatest cities.”Sir Cameron said his theatres would only reopen when social distancing requirements have been “completely removed” for theatres.Following the lifting of those rules, it will take several months of preparation for productions to be remounted, and Sir Cameron said it will also take time for audience confidence to build.The announcement follows publication of a report by Oxford Economics warning of 400,000 job losses and a £74 billion loss in annual revenue across the arts industry, in what they described as a Covid “cultural catastrophe”.Sir Cameron owns and manages eight West End venues and was in the middle of a £220 million, 10-year investment programme when the pandemic began.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meant conservative government finally acting like one","story":"Is Theresa May still in charge? Has Sir Keir Starmer suddenly become Prime Minister? What’s happened to the ebullient, optimistic, can-do Boris? These were the questions that even the Prime Minister’s greatest fans had started to ask after the drift, chaos and lack of direction of the past few weeks.With Boris Johnson almost invisible, the Government felt rudderless, bogged down in detail, strangely unable to lead us out of lockdown, excessively risk-averse and in hock to discredited “experts”. It gave the impression of being blase about the calamitous economic, educational and welfarist cultural consequences of the never-ending lockdown and insufficiently self-confident to be able to admit publicly that the state apparatus had failed.Then came the hijacking of the anti-racist protests, the traducing of a heartfelt movement decrying the despicable murder of George Floyd in America, the lawlessness, the hard-Left and hard-Right protests, the smack of cultural revolution, the orgy of officially-sanctioned wokeness.Where was Boris? Wasn’t this meant to be a conservative, patriotic and competent government? Why was Churchill’s statue boarded up, and the mob allowed to tear down or deface with impunity in what purports to be a law-governed democracy? Where was the modern, anti-racist, pro-meritocracy, conservative side of the argument, the alternative narrative that Boris ought to have been so great at delivering?Priti Patel and others did a great job putting that argument, but it felt piecemeal. The void from the centre was mystifying. It was as if the virus had blown the Government up, that it was still suffering from shell-shock, its confidence shot to pieces by the death toll, its ability to readjust to a new political landscape severely impaired.Some of this was unfair: No 10 has been forced to micromanage much of the fight against Covid as a result of the failure of our nationalised health establishment. Massive improvements have been quietly pushed through. Johnson was exhausted: the coronavirus is exceptionally draining and damaging, and its victims take ages to recover fully. But political warfare isn’t fair, and the Government made unforced errors, not least in imposing a quarantine even on countries that have defeated the virus. Its inability to reopen schools has proved especially debilitating, as has its obsession with a two-metre rule that isn’t followed in nations that have reopened without a second wave.Yes, the Government is right to be worried: Covid is a terrible threat, and the number of cases is shooting up again in the US and elsewhere. But the only way forward is to reopen regardless, as France, Spain and Italy have done, to shift the narrative towards one of co-existence with a contained virus, to hope that new drugs and vaccines are arriving soon, to tell the public that they can go back to work, to put in place genuinely mass testing and tracing systems. We cannot lock down forever and we cannot afford to lock down again.The drift of the past two months has allowed the Left-wing establishment to reassert itself. The BBC has appointed one of its own as its new boss an ex-Treasury, ex-IMF, Left-wing think tanker was appointed as head of the Office for Budget Responsibility the CBI’s new boss used to advise Gordon Brown and work for the . The only economic policy we heard about – apart from the necessary spending of hundreds of billions to cushion the economy – were “green jobs”, state-infrastructure, government this and government that. The Left-liberal elites were beginning to hope again that Boris’ project was about to fail. The EU detected weakness, crashing the talks before seeking to prolong the transition.Yet with luck all of this is now history. The Government has finally launched its comeback, to the great relief of its base. It is holding firm on Brexit and reinjecting energy into the talks. Johnson sounds like himself his mojo is returning. The first real signs of this fightback came on Sunday, with the revelation of a crackdown against those defacing war monuments. We were also reminded that May’s gender-identifying reform plans would be ditched.Then Johnson wrote one of his classic, barnstorming articles for this newspaper. The new equalities commission, set up by the brilliant Munira Mirza, suggests an innovative, authentically liberal-conservative and anti-Marxist approach to tackling entrenched inequalities, racism and poverty. Kemi Badenoch, another Tory star who deserves to be promoted to the cabinet at the next reshuffle, will be leading the group. The significance of this endeavour and the excellence of the personnel selected for it cannot be underplayed.Next came the abolition of the Department for International Development, and its absorption into the Foreign Office. Australia and others have long since pushed through such a sensible reform, which will reduce waste, junkets and ineffective, counterproductive spending, and allow a unified foreign policy. It’s a great step in the right direction: the useless aid-industrial complex hates it.There have still been some missteps such as the fiasco over free school meals. It was never a battle worth fighting and should have been nipped in the bud. But the trend is hugely positive: Johnson was on his old form at PMQs, trouncing Starmer over the latter’s refusal to accept that it’s safe for children to return to school. His language is Johnsonian again: “A great ox has stood on your tongue”, he said of Starmer the aid reforms end “the great cashpoint in the sky”.Which takes us to the virus: Boris’s relaunch must extend to shaking-up the Government’s frightened approach. He needs to tell his Johnsonian stories again. Scientists can no longer be used as human shields. All schools will open fully in September, with no social distancing. He must ditch the two-metre rule immediately. Above all, he must display leadership, passion and optimism, dragging Britain back to quasi-normality.His language has shifted the signs are promising. But a PM elected with such support and promise can no longer allow his Government to falter. The next 12 months will determine his fate and legacy: the old Boris has returned, and the country cannot allow him to disappear again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden surprisingly slow achieving herd immunity study finds","story":"Sweden’s state epidemiologist has said the country has been “surprisingly slow” at achieving herd immunity.The death toll in Sweden passed 5,000 on Wednesday and the Scandinavian nation has one of the highest mortality rates in the world at 487 per 1m population, approximately ten times higher than neighbouring Norway.Yet an analysis by Werlabs AB of 50,000 tests showed that only 14 per cent of those living in the Stockholm region tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. In Bergamo, considered to be the epicentre of Italy’s deadly outbreak, about 57 per cent of people had antibodies. The UK’s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of people would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity from the novel coronavirus.Sweden chose not to implement a strict lockdown, running contrary to many other countries worldwide. Schools, shops and restaurants have all remained open during the course of 2020. Instead, the government deferred to scientific advice and recommended Swedes observe social distancing. There had been expectations that this policy choice would have allowed Sweden to achieve herd immunity without imposing an economically and socially crippling lockdown.However, in an interview with Swedish Radio, Anders Tegnell, Sweden\u0027s chief epidemiologist, admitted that immunity rates were low and that “it’s difficult to explain why this is so.”Mr Tegnell and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven have long defended their softer approach to lockdown, stating the disease is not something that can be defeated with a short term fix but that nation’s must learn to live with the virus.A minute’s silence was observed in the country’s parliament to honour the 5,000 people who lost their lives.Andres Norlen, the parliamentary speaker, said “parliament is mourning.

At its maximum point of total eclipse, the Moon will block approximately 99.4 per cent of the Sun, though this will only last for a fraction of a second.Nasa has mapped the trajectory of the annular solar eclipse, which sees its path pass over the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen, Oman, Pakistan, India, Nepal, China, Taiwan and Guam.The eclipse will not be visible for people in the southern hemisphere, nor in more northerly latitudes like the UK. It will also be impossible to view from North America, while travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic mean that people will be unable to fly to locations where it will be visible.For those unable to see it in person, Timeanddate will be hosting a live stream of the eclipse on its website.Created with Sketch.

Though they must come from some very extreme, intense part of the universe, there is no way of knowing what process gives rise to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe first FRB was picked up in 2007 and scientists have gone on to find more than 100 since. Initially, they were detected only as inidual blasts, but in recent times researchers have found repeating sources.Now astronomers have started to find bursts repeating in a pattern, where they seem to switch off and on in a predictable pattern.Scientists find exact location of radio blasts coming from spaceThe latest discovery sends out random bursts of radio waves over a four-day window, and then goes quiet for 12 days, before beginning again.Researchers watched the bursts for more than 500 days, noting that the 16-day pattern occurred consistently over that time, making it the most definitive pattern yet seen.“This FRB we’re reporting now is like clockwork,” says Kiyoshi Masui, assistant professor of physics in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.“It’s the most definitive pattern we’ve seen from one of these sources. And it’s a big clue that we can use to start hunting down the physics of what’s causing these bright flashes, which nobody really understands.”The discovery is reported in a new article, titled \u0027Periodic activity from a fast radio burst source\u0027, published in Nature today.The latest FRBs were picked up by CHIME, a radio telescope in British Columbia that began its work in 2017. Since then, it quickly started picking up FRBs, using a technique that allows it to stare at the entire sky rather than moving around if and when any burst is detected.The repeating nature of the burst could give new insight into where they are coming from.Possibilities include one single object such as a neutron star that is spinning and wobbling in space. That could explain the pattern to the blasts, since the 16-day period may be the time it takes for the object to spin around, with the four days of activity the ones in which it is pointing towards us.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pattern could be the result of the orbit between , and the interaction between the two objects, which would explain their regular pattern, scientists say.Another involves a static radio source that is going around a central star – that star could be letting out a cloud of gas that magnify the radio emissions and send them powerfully towards Earth. The repeating pattern could therefore be an indication of when that source travels through its clouds.The CHIME telescope works to keep exploring FRB, measuring one roughly each day. It will also keep watching the newly discovered burst, and any changes in its properties could offer an important hint about where it is coming from.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was this event that made him evil.After arriving at Sunnsyide, he decided to rule it like a prison and turn the other toys into his minions.  Over the years, many theories have drawn comparisons between Lots-o’s experience and the one Woody has in the original Toy Story (1995). The theory goes that by including Lots-o’ in Toy Story 3, the Pixar writers are showing what Woody could have become if Andy had replaced him when he and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) were left behind ar Pizza Planet.Created with Sketch.37 sequels that are even better than the original Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ridley Scott\u0027s Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens – directed by James Cameron – is a stone cold action classic. Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels.

Lots-o’ is basically a version of Woody with no kid.”When viewed in this way, the Lots-o’ scenes in Toy Story 3 take on a whole new, far more disturbing light.Find our ranking of every Pixar film – from worst to best – here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo? You’ll find plenty of of delicious ideas from the likes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Amanda Grant at vegpower.org.uk. You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

They also expect the overall welfare of the UK of the population to be slightly lower as a result of the deal. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA trade agreement with New Zealand could have limited effects on UK GDP in the long run, with the estimated impact on GDP being close to zero under both scenarios compared to the UK not having a trade deal with New Zealand (between 0.00 per cent and 0.01 per cent in scenario 1 and -0.01 per cent and 0.00 per cent in scenario 2), the document says.However the trade deal would be slightly more beneficial to New Zealand itself, the government found, noting that GDP in New Zealand is estimated to see economic growth of 0.14 per cent or 0.35 per cent as a result of this FTA in scenario 1 and 2, respectively.UK and EU agree to intensify trade talks as Brexit deadline loomsExtend Brexit transition period to save stalling trade talks, EU urgesWhile the government expects a trade deal to slightly increase productivity and gross value added, its modelling also warns that not all areas of the country would benefit.In Northern Ireland, output may decrease relative to the baseline, reflecting a higher concentration of the agriculture and semi-processed food sectors, the document says. Exports to New Zealand are expected to increase by between 3.8 per cent and 7.3 per cent under the deal. The government expects there to be a significant increase in imports of New Zealand lamb coming to Britain.Overall the government projects that a substantial deal will reduce the welfare of the population. The document says: Headline welfare changes are limited under scenario 1 and are estimated to decrease by 0.01 per cent in scenario 2.Despite the potential damage to the UK economy from the deal, negotiations were formally launched on Wednesday, alongside talks with Australia.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailA similar analysis published by the government today expects a trade agreement with Australia to increase UK GDP in the long run by around 0.01 per cent or 0.02 per cent, also a negligible amount, particularly over the 15 year long-run period. The UK economy shrank by 20 per cent in April alone on the back of the coronavirus crisis.The government also admitted in March that its flagship trade deal with Donald Trump\u0027s United States would boost UK GDP by 0.16 per cent. However, the government is keen to sign trade deals with other countries to illustrate the benefits of leaving the European Union\u0027s customs union, in which Britain could not sign its own agreements but benefits from collective deals negotiated by the EU. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: Today\u0027s launch of trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand is a historic moment for this county.When we left the EU we did so on the promise of trading more with friends and allies across the world. Deals with Australia and New Zealand are a powerful expression of our newfound independence and our intent to build a global Britain.

The businesses I speak to around the country simply cannot understand why the government is spending so much time and effort trying to negotiate international trade deals of relatively low value when it is yet to secure our continued trade with Europe. When the 47 per cent of our trade that depends on Europe is still hanging on the balance then that is where the government\u0027s priority should lie.Speaking at the Commons international trade committee on Wednesday, Nick von Westenholz director of EU exit at the National Farmers\u0027 Union said: There is a huge market of 450m consumers on our doorstep in very close proximity so it will remain hugely important market for us. Absolutely we should look for trade opportunities elsewhere around the world in the years ahead but none of those even collectively will make up for the significant damage agriculture might experience if we have a very hard end of the transition period next year.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And it couldnt come at a greater time of need: with our nation on the brink of the worst ever holiday hunger.The Covid pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on families up and down the country, with millions now struggling to keep a roof over their heads.Parents are, understandably, racked with anxiety over job losses, loved ones health and school closures, which have seen classrooms lie empty for  weeks.And this week, with the summer holidays looming, they faced another worry: how would they feed their children without free school meal vouchers Its a fear Rashford has bravely alleviated.The Man Utd star made an impassioned plea to the Government to prioritise Englands most vulnerable kids by extending the vouchers scheme over the six-week holidays.Under the programme, the families of around . million children eligible for free school meals are given £ a week in vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.This is not about politics this is about humanity, Rashford wrote in an open letter. Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to bed hungry The footballer was speaking from real experience: growing up in a low-income household in Manchester, his own family relied on free school meals and breakfast clubs.Today, a similar hand-to-mouth existence is being lived by millions of children across the country. And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The furious tirade was released just hours before North Korea demolished the liaison office in Kaesong which was set up by the two sides in .Tensions have been renewed between the Koreas following a row over defectors and activists sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border into the North.In a commentary published by state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmum, Kims regime warned: The world will clearly see how our people, who unconditionally trust and follow their leader… exterminate the human scum from this planet.It pledged enemies of North Korea will be covered in boiling molten metal and said efforts by South Korean authorities to crackdown on the activists were too late.Chillingly, North Korea also warned its people value their supreme dignity more than that their own lives in thinly veiled threat of conflict.Kim Jong-uns forces have also openly threatened to push troops into the demilitarized zonethat separates the two Koreas. Pyongyang announced today that the liaison office had been tragically ruined in a terric explosion.Smoke from the blast visible all the way from South Korea, with the explosion first being spotted by border guards.In fiery statements, North Korea warned defectors would pay dearly for their crimes.Meanwhile, the South Korean military vowed a strong response to any provocative actions as soldiers and weapons were seen along the border.South Koreas top military leaders have also moved to a combat control office amid the crisis - which came as its howitzers carried out a drill near the DMZ.In a statement, the defence ministry said: Regarding the current security situations, our military has been closely monitoring the North Korean militarys movements round-the-clock, and doing its best to manage the situation to prevent the situation from escalating into a military crisis.Unication minister Suh Ho, who was Seoul’s top official at the liaison office, called the demolition an “unprecedentedly senseless act.He said the move shocked not only our people, but the whole world as hopes of peace now lie in tatters.North and South Korea - who have remained technically at war since  - had been steaming ahead with peace talks since , but recently progress had stalled.The liaison office was seen as a milestone when it was opened in September that year, allowing the two sides to regularly communicate.Te .millionbuildinghowever now lies in ruins as hopes of peace seem to have come crashing down.Kims sister Kim Yo-Jong appears to be the driving force behind the incident as she has recently regularly blasted the South.She has enjoyed a meteoric rise to power over the past two years and is now considered by many to be Kims de-facto number two and successor.Renewed hostilities come amid a row over activist groups sending anti-North Korean propaganda over the border from the South.North Korea defectors had been flying balloons containing leaflets, cash, USB drives and SD cards into the rogue state.South Korean authorities had attempted to crack down on the practice, but campaigners vowed to continue. North Korea had warned that plans for retaliation were underway - and identied the liaison office as its first target before blowing it up at .pm local time.Surveillance video released by the South Korean military shows a huge explosion ripping through the complex.The two countries reached a tentative peace deal during talks in  - agreeing to finally try and bring an official end to the Korean War after  years of deadlock.The two Koreas were officially ided in , before the Soviet Union-backed North invaded the US-backed South just two years later.A bloody conflict was waged - almost acting as a proxy for the Cold War - before being ended with an armistice in .The North is now thought to be applying pressure in the hope of securing relief from crippling international economic sanctions.The General Staff of the Korean Peoples Army, the armed forces of North Korea, laid out the threats to move into the DMZ in state media.The DMZ is a strip around . miles wide that runs across the entire width of the Korean Peninsula, separating the North and South.The move follows a decision by the North last week to stop contact with the South and sever hotlines between the countries political and military leaders.Since the demolition of the liasion office, North Korea has said it has now cut all communication with Seoul.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the majority anyway.Be it scientist “Professor Lockdown” flouting his own advice, or Boris’s svengali Dominic Cummings bending the rules he helped make, the rot set in a couple of weeks ago and has now caused an undeniable fissure between the state and its initially compliant citizens.Yet, while thousands are blatantly breaking social distancing rules at parks, protests and shopping areas, many of them are still being furloughed — at vast taxpayer expense — to “stay home” from work.Whereas common sense dictates that being in an office that’s been health and safety-ed to the nth degree is a far more protected environment than any of the above.And what about schools  The majority of learning for GCSEs and A levels takes place in years  and  respectively, yet government plans for the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"reopening of secondary schools remain “unclear”, with some reports saying they might not evenin September.Meaning that — on top of GCSEs and A levels being cancelled this year — hundreds of thousands of pupils will be in no position to take them next year either.If teenagers can gather in large, cheek-by-jowl groups at their local park, then surely ing to school isn’t beyond the pale  It might even be safer.As for the hospitality industry, well, not only is the two-metre rule killing it but pubs, in particular, face the galling reality of remaining closed while their beer gardens are used by hordes of people who’ve bought booze at the local supermarket.Enough already. Time, surely, for the Government to open its eyes to what’s happening around the country and exercise some common sense.Of course those who are vulnerable should continue to take as many protective measures as they wish, including remaining furloughed or off schoolnecessary.But the majority should nowto work or schooland start to get Britain back on its feet, both economically and psychologically.SCIENTISTS say that intelligent le could exist on as many as  planets in our galaxy.But they reckon aliens won’t visit Earth because of the distance.The two-week quarantine rules won’t help either.HOLLYWOOD actress Sharon Stone has revealed she was struck by lightening while doing the ironing.What a terrible shock.No, not the estimated billion volts that propelled Sharon across the kitchen, silly.The fact that a movie star was doing her own housework.TATLER magazine’s \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"controversial article on The Duchess of Cambridge proved that snobbery is still alive and kicking in certain sections of the British “upper” classes.Dredging up the age-old “doors to manual” jibe at Kate’s mother Carole, a former member of cabin crew, it also resurrected ancient, alleged whisperings among chinless wonders of her being “NQOCD” – not quite our class, darling.This week, Rosalind Mann died, after a -year career taking photos of posh “girls in pearls” for Country Le magazine.When asked the criteria for posing, she replied: “We never featured anyone whose house had a number.”There’s snobbery in the US too, but it’s largely centred around money, rather than class.In the compellingly vacuous Netflix series Selling Sunset, about a high-end estate agency in Hollywood, the buzz phrase is: “Millionaires have views, billionaires have compounds.”Sadly, I have neither.IN the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, it’s reported that the legendary spy has a young daughter with Lea Seydoux’s character.Could this see those famous blue trunks being replaced by a papoose It’s tricky waters for Bond fans, with  per cent telling a recent poll that they think it’s a mistake to make the famous philanderer a family man.I’ll reserve judgment until the film is released, but suffice to say, tackling villains such as Le Chfre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva is child’s play compared to dealing with a toddler in meltdown.A PUNTER has placed a bet on Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis becoming PM by the end of .A spokesman for bookmaker Coral said: “The bet took us by surprise but someone’s convinced Maitlis could be the perfect match for No!”Presumably they’re not taking bets on which party she’d stand for as that would be too obvious.RICKY Gervais says that wherever he is in the world, he always frequents Italian restaurants because: “I know it’s going to be good and the same.”We have a similar issue at Moore Towers where – whether we’re at a Greek, French, Chinese, Italian or Japanese restaurant – the Bloke will spend aeons studying the ious culinary delights on offer before ordering “steak and chips” pretty much every time.THE stylist and “best friend” to Meghan Markle, Jessica Mulroney, is embroiled in a race row after appearing to threaten the livelihood of black lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter.Jessica, who has apologised, has now been dropped from regular TV slots and, while the pair have reportedly spoken in private, the Duchess of Sussex has yet to support her friend publicly.Something tells me that, aside from saying: “I need to do better” regarding race and injustice in society, Jessica is about to learn another valuable lesson.Hard times will always reveal true friends.CLOTHING website Missguided has been heavily criticised by shoppers after using slim models to market its plus-range of clothes in sizes  to .One said: “This screams, ‘we want to profit from plus-sized iniduals without representing or supporting them in any way’.” Very true.Equally, those ads for accessible baths showers targeted at the elderly but featuring a woman in her forties with the agility of a mountain goat.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it was the right thing to do:  parents struggling to feed their children need all the help they can get right now. And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense.

Sky News claims Portuguese tests on the sample apparently found no DNA match to Christian B.Authorities in Germany believe their scientists should do their own tests.But Portuguese police may not send the sample due to legal restrictions in sending samples abroad for testing and recent criticism of them from Germany, Sky reports.Asked about todays report about the saliva sample, Braunschweig state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the Madeleine investigation, said: That information is not mine.

I cant confirm anything.You can help by calling Operation Grange with information on    or email Operation.grange@met.police.ukThe Met Police, who have also been investigating Madeleines disappearance through their missing person inquiry Operation Grange, were unable to comment.Last week, The Sun reported that scientists in Portugal were unable to obtain a full DNA profile at the time but have continued to work on it with new testing techniques.The sample is being held at the National Institute of Legal, Medical and Forensic Science, in Coimbra, near Lisbon.Forensic tests have also been carried out on particles taken from the floor, sofa, walls and skirting board in the McCann’s apartment at the Ocean Village complex.Christian B is currently in jail in the north German town of Kiel after being convicted of drug offences. Last year, he was convicted of a  rape of a -year-old widow, which he is appealing.Yesterday, Christain Bs lawyer Friedrich Fulscher spoke for the first time to say his client denies any involvement in the McCann case. It also emerged that a request by his legal team to the European Court of Justiceon breaches over his  extradition from Italy to Germany was being considered.His lawyers are challenging the evidence and witness statements against him and accuse German authorities of breaching international law.He was arrested for an outstanding drugs offence but then put on trial back in Germany for the rape following his arrest in Milan. The ECJ decision is expected by July .But Mr Wolters said there are doubts over whether Christian B could be released then as he faces another court appearance in the German town of Flensburg over his drug-dealing case, for which he is eligible for parole having served two thirds of his sentence.Mr Wolters told Sun Online: I think this decision [the drug dealing parole] would be the first decision. Andin this case the judge says he has to stay in prison, he will be in prison longer than July .I think that he will not be released in the drug-dealing case, so he has to stay in prison until, I think, January .And so the decision of the European Court is not so important to us. Im not sure that the judge in the drug-dealing case will not release him, its a possibility, but I think the possibility is very small.The second thing is that the European Court must find a mistake in the rape verdict, so only in this caseboth come together he could be released on July .He added we are hopeful, but not sure of being closer to charging Christian B.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She told the Work and Pensions Select Committee today: A lack of savings pushedinto debt and severe hardship. They were unable to pay their essential bills, rent arrears increased, and people talked with alarm of increased risk of homelessness and eviction.A study done by Dr Cheetham with Northumbria University looked at the experiences of  UC claimants in the North-East of England and  staff working in organisations supporting those people. She said: The five-week wait was rarely five weeks for the claimants we spoke to. For a lot of them, particularly those who were struggling with computer access or digital literacy issues, for about half our sample the wait for a Universal Credit was longer than five weeks. The average wait time for the first payment was around seven-and-a-half weeks, and stretched up to  weeks. For some who had to wait  weeks for their first payments, they were still waiting for full payments even after that. Dr Cheetham told MPs: Some were faced with the very dficult decision between eating and heating - food and fuel poverty was a feature of their accounts. She said one devastating example of this was a diabetic person who had to skip meals because they could not afford to buy food. Some were forced to borrow money off friends and family and many struggled to cope with the shame and stigma of admitting they couldnt make ends meet. The impact on mental and physical health was extreme, people talks about self harm, they talked about anxiety and depression, and six participants said they felt so low they considered suicide. As many as , people in a study of , people who experienced psychological problems as a result of waiting for the first UC payment hit clinical levels of anxiety and depression, the MPs were told. According to new statistics from Office of National Statistics more than . million people have now claimed Universal Credit since the start of the lockdown. The Sun launched the Make Universal Credit Work campaign to slash wait times for first payments so people arent forced to sell their belongings or take out loans to survive - and to make it easier for people to get back to work.Dr Sophie Wickham, a research fellow at the Wellcome Trust, told the Committee that although the main aim of Universal Credit was to get people back into work there was no evidence that benefits helped people move back into the workforce. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said Dr Cheethams comments were based on a dated study which features a tiny sample size. They said: They fail to recognise the extraordinary efforts of our staff to help people through the current pandemic.“No one has to wait for money under Universal Credit as urgent payments are available and around % of people are paid in full and on time. In fact, we’ve improved payment timeliness during the current emergency whilst processing more than . million new claims to UC since mid-March.“We recognise this is a dficult time for people on low incomes and we’ve injected more than £.bn into the welfare system – including increasing Universal Credit by up to £, a year - to help those in most need.”One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes five weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

To do something of meaning, to do something that matters. Archewell is a name that combines an ancient word for strength and action, and another that evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon.They added: We look forward to launching Archewell when the time is right.The non-profit aims to offer classes, lectures, seminars, conferences, workshops, and retreats on a iety of topics, run a mentoring scheme, or conduct and host events and exhibitions for cultural, sporting, health, mental health and entertainment purposes, as well as the potential to self-publish articles, magazines, books, music, podcasts, television shows, and computer software.According to reports this week, they have delayed their plans until at least next year, as they focus their efforts on the Black Lives Matter movement and fighting COVID-. Describing how a public launch is now off the cards, a source told the Daily : Whats absolutely clear is that they want to get it right and theres no point in rushing.They are settling into a new le, a new era.

International Trade Secretary Liz Truss revealed the UK wanted to become a member of the -strong Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacic Partnership. Countries signed-up to the pact include Australia and New Zealand – which the UK will open separate talks in the coming weeks – as well as Brunei, Vietnam and Peru. Ms Truss told the Commons: Agreements with New Zealand and Australia are an important step towards our vision of a truly global Britain – a Britain that is once again a fierce campaigner for free trade.  A Britain that leads by example and membership of CPTPP is the next logical step. “Joining the agreement would show the rest of the world we are back as a proud, independent nation prepared to look far beyond our own shores.Her Labour counterpart Emily Thornberry said trade deal talks were already underway with CPTPP countries apart from “Malaysia and Brunei, which between them accounted for just .% of the UKaposs total world trade last year”.Urging the Government to target efforts on securing a deal with the EU, she added: “The businesses I speak to around the country simply cannot understand why the Government is spending so much time and effort trying to negotiate international trade deals of relatively little value when it is yet to secure our continued trade with Europe.  “When the % of our trade that depends on Europe is still hanging in the balance then that is where the Governmentaposs priorities should lie.” While Britain formally left the bloc on January , exit triggered an -month transition to allow time to agree a trade pact. The clock is ticking down to the December  deadline when, the Government insists, the transition will end and not be extended. However, talks have stalled over allowing EU boats to fish in British waters and the UK having access to the single market. Sue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at consumer group Which , said: There are many potential benefits to be gained from trade deals with Australia and New Zealand. “Ultimately, their success will be judged by the impact they have on the price, choice and safety of products and services we use everyday so any deals must reflect consumersapos expectations.

Thousands of youngsters, particularly those from disadvantaged families, face a ruined educationthey are not able tosafely in September.We urge the PM to find alternative class space, fund extra teachers, give poor kids free internet and help those who have fallen behind. Lib Dem Layla Moran said: “Schools need more resources. Mr Johnson needs to take responsibility for this shambles.” As millions of children face six months out of class, medical and educational chiefs are also urging the PM to give schools the resources they need to reopen this autumn. Union leaders, medical and education chiefs, backed by the Mirror’s campaign, are warning that the poorest and most vulnerable children will struggle to close the attainment gap. Prof Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said top doctors have a “very real concern” for children’s health. More than , paediatricians have also signed an unprecedented open letter to the PM, calling for a clear plan for getting children back to school. Teachers’ leaders warned yesterday that England’s schools would not be able to fully reopen after the summer holidays under current distancing rules requiring just  pupils in a class. Today, the Mirror is calling for the Government to work with parents, teachers, education unions and council leaders to get children back into school. We want ministers to to find alternative spaces, such as church halls, community centres, sports venues and libraries to give schools the space they need to maintain social distancing. Heads should be given funding to hire extra staff, including supply and trainee teachers and –it’s safe for them – recently retired teachers. The poorest children should be given free internet and equipment to narrow the ide, so no child is left behind.  And we need a massive catch-up programme to run over the over the summer, and beyond, to help those who have missed out on education at home. Prof Viner said: “Children need their schools. Every child deserves to have an uninterrupted education. But teachers do so much more than teach and schools provide so much more than education. Schools are vital to the wellbeing of children, providing a range of services from vaccinations to mental health support. Schools are also where at-risk children are looked out for and supported. Schools are also where our children run around, play and laugh and argue with each other. They need toto that sort of a healthy normality as soon as possible.”  Lib Dem’s education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: “Making our High Streets Covid-secure is critical. But it seems the Prime Minister is more concerned about allowing betting shops to re-open than getting children safely back into school. “It shows where the Government’s priorities lie. Schools urgently need the resources for more space and staff so that more pupils cansafely. Boris Johnson needs to take responsibility for this shambles, work with teachers and experts to agree a plan and stop treating our schools like a political football.” Labour Leader Keir Starmer told the Mirror: “It was Education Secretary Gavin Williamson who said on June  we’re not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer. I have said repeatedly that I want schools to reopen as soon as possible. I’ve offered to work with the Prime Minister to address this issue.” Coronavirusandschools.org.uk is giving parents and carers educational advice from real teachers while the schools are closed. The website has been set up by the National Education Union who represent almost half a million teachers and support staff. It features video tips from teachers, QAs on exams and tests, learning at home and child wellbeing. Plus there are fun activities parents can do with their children to stimulate their brains and keep them learning.  Click here to check it out for advice, resources and useful links. Mr Starmer, who has sent his own children to school through the lockdown because his we works for the NHS, added: “This is a Government with a majority of , it has its responsibilities and it should be doing everything in its power to reopen schools as soon as possible. The PM wants all England’s children back in school from September, after six months of coronavirus disruption. But he has tried to sht the blame for the fact that many of those in the years that are eligible tohave not yet done so.  Government plans to bring in Years R,  and  are in chaos, and a third of England’s primary failed to do so by June . Proposals to bring back Years , ,  and  by the start of July had to be dropped after officials accepted there was not enough space to maintain social distancing. Distancing rules have left schools scrambling to find space and rope in support staff to lead lessons. Ministers have been urged to adopt more creative proposals, including taking a Nightingale approach – based on the temporary hospitals set up to treat Covid- patients – to schools by providing extra space in community centres and town halls.  They have also been told to make sure heads have enough funding to encourage recently retired and supply teachers back into the classroomit is safe for them to do so. Downing Street is planning to set out its “catch up” plans for the summer later this week, and further plans “within weeks” to get more children back into the classroom after the summer holidays. The PM’s official spokesman said: “The PM has set out a very clear message… school is safe and he wants parents to send their children back to school. We’ll continue to encourage parents to have their kids back in school and I’m sure those numbers will continue to rise.” But Mr Johnson suggested that Labour and the trade unions were hampering efforts to reopen. He said: “The kids that can go to school, should go to school and wouldn’t it be a fine thingwe heard from all sides of the House that schools are safe to go to, rather than the wibble-wobble that we’ve heard from the Opposition ” But four education unions being quizzed by the Commons Education committee hit back, and demanded more clarity and action from the Government.  Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned MPs something would have to givethe Government wanted schools to open fully in September under current rules. “If the Government retains its social distancing rules, then they can’t [opne],” she said. “So that’s why we then need to look at an education recovery plan, which is focused on more than school buildings. “[It’s] about increasing the physical footprint of the school, about increasing the numbers of teachers available to teach smaller classes, and about a national plan for blended learning.” Jon Richards, National Secretary at Unison, said “you have to have facilities set up” and there were still “serious issues” around cleaning and canteens. Julie McCulloch, of the ASCL union, said: “If it’s at all possible and considered safe then absolutely we want all children to be back in school from September. “That is by far the best solution. But we’re not able to do that at the moment within the Government’s own protective measures guidance. The maths just doesn’t work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gyms leisure centres five aside","story":"NewsGyms, leisure centres and five-a-side games couldin July, minister saysYoga, weight sessions, five-a-side footie with pals - all could be allowed from as early as July  after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden hinted that grassroots sport will be the next focus now the Premier League is back on TV screensShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video oliver-dowden-quizzed-public-toilets-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics gyms-leisure-centres-five-aside-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Premier League football ed tonight, but in empty stadiums. Dowden said: Sports recovery is never just about elite sports. I know people are itching to get back to their gyms, their leisure centres, their five-a-side leagues… and all the normal fitness activities. So we are working closely to get grassroots and community sport back and up running as soon as it’s safe to so - with an aim at the start of July at the very earliest.

Swimmers were today warned they will need to get used to a new normal when pools reopen. People will be asked to avoid swimming butterfly at busy times or overtaking other pool users in order to maintain social distancing in the water, according to new guidance released today.  Swim England is also recommending arriving with a swimming costume under clothes and showering at home to reduce the amount of time spent in changing rooms when facilities are allowed to welcome visitors again. Pools are being encouraged to only offer sessions that can be booked in advance and apply one-way systems on poolside to help keep swimmers apart.

Footage shows Hancock slapping a colleague on the back in the House of Commons, against the strict rules of which he himself has been at pains to remind people.The clip has been trending on Twitter, and shows the Health Secretary putting his arm around a colleague as he enters the Commons, before a third MP appears and stands beside both of them.The man in the middle then takes a step back before Hancock takes a step across the fill the gap left and speak to the third MP, and then moves back again. Hancock told the BBC he was so sorry for a human mistake on my part. Like all of us, I instinctively wanted to reach out to a friend Iaposd just seen - in this case, for the first time in many weeks. I realised my mistake and corrected myself, he said. He claimed the clip shows just how hard it can be to social distance but stressed it was so important that we all keep trying to do our bit. Hancock and other ministers have repeatedly told the public to keep two metres away from people who are not in their household. The Health Secretary himself contracted coronavirus in March shortly after the Prime Minister came down with the deadly bug.At the end of April, the World Health Organisationsaid there was no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid- and have antibodies for the virus are protected from a second infection. In a scientic brief, the United Nations agency warned governments against issuing immunity passports or risk-free certicates to people who have been infected as their accuracy cannot be guaranteed.  After the apparent slip-up, Hancock spoke to the Commons and addressed the matter of reducing social distancing from two metres to one metre. His comments came as businesses pushed for the rule change, something they say will be vital for their recovery as the lockdown eases. Hancock said: Itaposs the sort of thing of course we want to lt and we need to do that in a way that is careful and safe. The scientists are reviewing it, along with the economists, and we will take forward the further measures on this when itaposs possible and safe to do so.

The Health Secretary originally promised the app, still under testing on the Isle of Wight, would be rolled out across the nation in ‘mid-May’. He told Brits it was their “duty” to download it in large numbers in order to combat the spread of Covid-. But as the deadline was missed, Mr Hancock and test and trace chief Dido Harding have said it the “cherry on the cake” - and not essential to the contact tracing push. And today, Health Minister Lord Bethel indicated the delivery of the app had slipped even further. He told the Science and Technology Committee the pilot of the app on the Isle of Wight had been successful, but also showed that people prefer human contact to a technological one. Speaking of the app, he said: Weaposre seeking to get something going for the winter, but it isnapost the priority for us at the moment. He added that the Government was not feeling great time pressure over the app, and it did not want to poison the pool by rushing something out that isnapost quite right. Earlier, Number  said there was no update on when the NHS Covid- contact-tracing app would be ready for roll-out. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman, asked when the app would be made available to the public, said: I donapost have a date. Asked to confirm what the problem was with the app, he said: The latest test and trace numbers will be published tomorrow, tomorrow morning I believe. There may well be the opportunity for you to ask further questions about the app during the course of the day, but Iaposve not got any update. Yesterday, a leading health academic said the UK’s Covid- contact tracing system was nowhere near world beating, as promised by the Prime Minister.

The secret makeover will see the rear of its fuselage and tail fin sprayed red, white and blue – perhaps making it resemble a British Airways plane. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said the paint job would enable the Prime Minister to better represent the UK around the world with national branding while also retaining its military air-to-air refuelling capability. He said the repainting job will cost £,. This incorporates the cost of design to promote the UK around the world without compromising the plane’s vital military role. A source told Sky News: Boris doesnapost like it being grey. He is getting it painted up.” Mr Johnson has previously criticised the planeaposs livery, demanding to know: “Why is it grey ” He apparently did not realise it had to be that colour so that when it is carrying out military duties above war zones it is more dficult for enemies to pick out in the sky.

He might be painted gold, dipped in glitter and placed in a black marbled atrium.A Premier League footballer has never owned a Prime Minister before. Having done more than any number of high-end family lawyers to make Johnson cough up for the children of single parents, Marcus Rashford may be wondering what to do with the increasingly-whfy carcass of the PMaposs career. It is the likes of Johnson - that is to say, fact-free throb-jockeys - who have established the cliche of footballers wasting their wealth on blingtastic tat. Far more went on properties, or charity, or rehab. In Rashfordaposs case, he built his mum and siblings an unassumingly-neat house a few miles from where they grew up, and moved in with them. He was renting his family a place to live at the age of , paying his taxes, and thanking his lucky stars. When Johnson was , he spent a gap year teaching Latin to Australians, the benefits of which, beyond making jokes that have to be Googled, no-one has yet fathomed. Inutilus, ergo sum. In the years immediately preceding Rashfordaposs birth, Johnson wrote that poorer, working mums create adverse consequences for family le and society as a whole - in that unloved and undisciplined children are more likely to become hoodies, NEETS, and mug you on the street corner. Heaposs mugged you all right, sunshine. Mugged you RIGHT off. Johnson once said it was outrageous that married couples should pay for single mothersapos desire to procreate independently of men. And yesterday he announced every taxpayer in the land - which includes single parents as well as married ones, by the by - will be contributing £m to feed these objects of his disgust who are, oh yes, actual human beings.Weaposre now at the stage where, when a footballer starts a campaign to feed hungry children, the Department for Education rejects his request, and an official spokesman issues a refusal on his behalf, the PM claims not to have known anything about it in the apparent belief this makes him sound like a better PM. Within hours, the Number  spin machine had called the PM a liar, in the apparent belief that made him sound better. Weaposre not so much through the looking glass, as exiled to the Phantom Zone and outside the normal space-time continuum.We donapost even get General Zodaposs hair to admire, or Ursaaposs eyeliner. We are incarcerated with the political equivalent of Non, a man neither as focused nor as fully-ing as the average hamster. As Ron Atkinson once said, this is a game all about the two Ms - movement and positioning. Perhaps Johnson will respond to the absolute schooling Rashford has given him in the power of popularity by trying to be more like a footballer. Maybe weaposll see the PM adopt a man-bun, or diamond ear-studs, or Sky Sports-style fake roars of crowd approval. If this should happen, let us all pray we are not also subjected to a gruesome kiss-and-tell. But while Johnsonaposs greatest strength is his sociopathic indference to the truth, Rashfordaposs is the ability to see where he came from, and make the worst parts good. His mum Melanie is rightly proud as punch that her boyaposs former hunger has put food in the bellies of millions of children. THATaposS how you bling up the bad.Johnson, on the other hand, sees no harm in where he came from. No damage done by paternal adultery, marriage breakdown, or elite schooling in which children are told they have a right to run the world. He never learns from his past, the forced apologies, the firings, the losses of political capital gt-wrapped and delivered by his brilliant strategist. He just carries on lying by the seat of his pants, and why not. It has got him this far. But when a footballer announces he has helped to feed million of the countryaposs most vulnerable people, when a -year-old with no experience of politics is more diplomatic, powerful, and loquacious than the PM, when the government is in such disarray that they make the Football Ladsapos Alliance look sane and organised, then whataposs the point of Boris   Johnsonaposs appeal is based on his entertainment value. His current jape is presenting us with a charnel house, built and then filled by ethnic minorities, while he capers around telling us statues matter more than black lives. If only heaposd paid attention while studying classics, heaposd know thataposs tragedy, not comedy. He has not produced the Brexit promised, and which the majority of Britons want. He is not levelling up so much as carpet-bombing everywhere. The Red Wall he seized is collapsing at the same time as the Blue Base he canapost bail the disappointment out of quickly enough.The purpose of a Prime Minister is to be first among equals. To lead, idealise, and effect. Rashford, who has none of the privilege Johnson enjoys, has done better than him at all three.

One in five in this “lost generation” have suffered deteriorating physical health during the lockdown, and a third say their mental health has worsened. Nearly half believe their personal finances will take a hit in the next year, found an Ipsos Mori poll for the Centre for Ageing Better. The charity’s chief Anna Dixon said: “This group are being ignored when it comes to proposed actions to support the recovery. At the same time, it’s clear this group also face serious risks to their health.“If this generation continues to be an afterthought in the coronavirus recovery we’ll see a lost generation entering retirement in poorer health and worse financial circumstances than those before them.” It came amid suggestions that Chancellor Rishi Sunak was considering suspending the Tories’ triple-lock pensions manesto pledge.The mechanism ensures the state pension rises in line with the highest of wages, inflation or .%, so any change would save the Treasury billions – but also risks angering millions of pensioners. Experts believe a temporary suspension is inevitable unless the Government is prepared to pay a massive bill next year. There are signs that the bounce back in wages for furloughed workers could push up average earnings and put pensioners in line for an % increase. There is also uncertainty over inflation. Boris Johnson yesterday warned of “tough times ahead” as ministers faced pressure to increase support for some of the poorest households.The triple lock could be replaced with a lower guaranteed minimum of % or .%, or a “double lock” – raising the pension by the highest of inflation or earnings growth, but with no guaranteed minimum.  Retirement expert and former Tory Pensions Minister Ros Altmann said: “The Government absolutely must protect pensioners... However, all policy decisions are likely to be revisited in light of the health and economic crisis. “It is important not to rush to hasty conclusions, but I hope [people] will consider the way the triple lock actually works and objectively assess whether it may have run its course.” Downing Street played down the suggestion the triple lock could be suspended or scrapped. But a No source said: “These are unique and challenging economic circumstances and we can’t hide from that.”A spokesman for Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “We’ve long said the triple lock is an important means of addressing the relatively low state pension by international standards.”The TUC also warned the triple lock must stay because our state pension is one of the lowest in the developed world.

Teachersapos leaders demanded public buildings are taken over for extra classroom space - saying there just isnapost room to bring back whole schools of -strong mini-classes. And they warned children may still need to rely on blended learning - a mix of homeschooling and attending in person - beyond September. Unions clashed with Tory MPs as they demanded a clear plan from the government - insisting they were simply trying to follow scientic advice. Boris Johnson wants all Englandaposs children back in school from September after six months of coronavirus disruption.But plans to bring in years R,  and  are mired in chaos, with a third of Englandaposs primary schools still not doing so by June . And plans to bring back years , ,  and  by the start of July had to be dropped after officials accepted there wasnapost enough space. Distancing rules say children must be taught in bubbles of  kids, each in a separate room. That has left schools scrambling to find space and rope in support staff to lead lessons. Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, warned MPs something had to give. Askedschools could open fully in September under current restrictions, she told the Education Committee: If the Government retains its social distancing rules then they canapost.  So thataposs why we then need to look at an education recovery plan, which is focused on more than school buildings. “We’ve got one, the NEU has got one, about increasing the physical footprint of the school, about increasing the numbers of teachers available to teach smaller classes, and about a national plan for blended learning. Jon Richards, National Secretary at UNISON, said you have to have facilities set up and there were still “serious issues” around cleaning and canteens. He added: I’m hoping we’ll be open to reopen schools, as many as we can, in September. But as Mary said, it will depend to an extent on what the government says.  Julie McCulloch, Director of Policy at the ASCL union, said: If it’s at all possible and considered safe then absolutely we want all children to be back in school from September. That is by far the best solution. But as colleagues have said we’re not able to do that at the moment within the government’s own protective measures guidance. The maths just doesn’t work. If you can only have up to  children in a class, and you’re bringing back all children, you need twice as many classrooms and twice as many teachers. Now clearly there are conversations we can have about how we might be able to have more space and how we might be able to increase the teaching workforce, but neither of those is straightforward. She added the best outcome -the science says that this is safe and appropriate - would be to have all children back with some of those measures relaxed in September.  Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT, added: Schools should open as quickly as possible, we’ve been very very clear about that. We want to see clarity from government about what the expectations are from September in terms of what schooling will look like. The union chiefs have hit back at Tory MPs in a furious clash over whether schools are safe. Tensions bubbled over at the Education Committee, where an MP accused unions of running a political campaign to keep schools shut. Tory Jonathan Gullis, a former teacher, accused unions of breathing fear into parents and making them think schools are death traps. The MP blasted: I am absolutely outraged at the sheer damage the unions have done to the teaching profession. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman insisted today: The PM has set out a very clear message… school is safe and he wants parents to send their children back to school. But the four unions being quizzed by the committee hit back - and demanded more clarity and action from the government. Union chiefs warned it was impossible to bring all pupils back while following guidance to keep them socially distanced and in -pupil classes.

They have previously been free of overt political content - which would require broadcasters to offer opposition politicians equal airtime under impartiality rules.But Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden broke with convention, using today’s briefing to attack Labour leader Keir Starmer.A Labour spokesperson said: People are understandably worried about the health and economic impacts of this pandemic. Rather than inappropriately using the daily briefing for political attacks, the government should be focussed on updating the public on the steps it is taking to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Answering a question from the BBCaposs Hugh Pym on schools, Mr Dowden said: I do think itaposs important as part of this that we really reassure parents that itaposs safe for their kids to go back. And Iaposve been really heartened by the incredible hard work that Iaposve seen from teachers up and down the country, whoaposve worked so hard in dficult circumstances to get kids back to school. I do think itaposs a bit of a shame that their unions and indeed, it appears, the leader of the Labour party is not also providing them with that kind of backing and support.Earlier at Prime Ministeraposs Questions, Boris Johnson repeatedly demanded Mr Starmer declare schools safe.But just last week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson scrapped plans tomore year groups to the classroom.

This Government has already decided to scrap free TV licences for the over-s. Now there are reports that the pension triple-lock is in its sights too. With an estimated .million pensioners on or below the poverty line, this would be not only a shortsighted move but a vindictive one. The older generation have paid the highest price for the coronavirus – they should not be made to pay an economic price as well. Plane stupid There are more than four million children living in poverty. Millions of elderly people cannot afford the care they need. Record numbers use foodbanks. These are the issues that should be at the top of the Prime Minister’s in-tray. And what is his priority   Spending nearly £million of taxpayers’ money repainting his ministerial jet. Downing Street claims that rebranding the plane in the colours of the Union Flag will help boost the UK’s reputation abroad. A better way to do that would be to change the plane’s passenger, not its paintwork.

A study of , adults found one third have been putting extra money aside - an average of £ - since lockdown began. More than two thirds of thoseare saving more by putting away the money they would normally spend on eating out, while almost half have banked refunds from cancelled holidays. And  per cent have saved the money they would have spent commuting to work. A fortunate three in  adults said they are currently financially better off than before the Covid- pandemic, while  per cent have managed to maintain their level of wealth. It also emerged spending habits have changed dramatically since the start of the lockdown, with the average adult £ better off after cutting back on unnecessary things such as clothing, takeaway coffee, eating out and entertaining. Maitham Mohsin, head of savings at Skipton Building Society, which commissioned the research, said: These are financially challenging times for many, so it is reassuring to see that some adults are able to set aside savings for a rainy day, to make the best use of their reduced savings. This pandemic is witnessing a change in attitudes to wealth, savings, and money - as people, are more than before understanding the real need to have a financial buffer for unforeseen eventualities such as furlough or job loss. Many people have had to take payment holidays on mortgages, and dip into savings to get by over these last two or three months never before has a savings pot been so needed. And this in itself is likely to encourage a more sensible approach to financial planning moving forward.  The study also found that Brits have seen their spending reduce on things like fuel, commuting and alcohol, which is helping them to save more than before. It emerged those who are saving more during lockdown have also been able to do so because they are spending less on childcare costs , family days outand birthday presents . Instead, more has been spent on cleaning products , TV streaming servicesand books or magazines to pass the time . However, the survey also highlights that one quarter of adults are worse off financially since the pandemic struck. One in four have had to accept a pay reduction since the crisis began, and  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, have taken either a loan or mortgage holiday - or both. It also emerged  per cent of adults have had to dip into their savings during lockdown - spending an average of £ to pay for essential bills , foodand council tax . But regardless of a personaposs current financial situation, six in  adults now say they are more likely to put money away for a rainy day, rather than spend it when they do have it. And while a fth are putting less money into savings at the moment, eight in  say theyaposd feel even more nervousthey didnapost have any rainy day fund to fall back on. In particular,  per cent of adults like to have savings for unexpected or emergency payments, and  per cent like to put money aside for home improvements.

A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in .

The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove.  He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter. It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds. No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum.

The Wild Planet Trust said it could no longer afford to reopen its Living Coasts site in Torquay, Devon, due to the huge cost of the coronavirus lockdown. It means  jobs are likely to be lost, while staff at Paignton Zoo and Newquay Zoo - which are owned by the same trust - are also at risk. The Devon site was home to a range of animals, including South American fur seals, African penguins, macaroni penguins, sea ducks, pied avocet, redshanks, black-necked stilts, ruffs, and terns. In a statement the trust said it regretted having to make the decision to close, but the attraction was no longer viable. It wrote on the Trustaposs website: Falling visitor numbers and the forced closure of all its zoos due to COVID- has meant that it has had to look at its cost base and make efficiencies. After nearly twenty years of operation the site also needed substantial maintenance that the Trust is no longer in a position to afford. It now means animals will have to be moved - but it is not yet clear how long this will take.  The site is home to a penguin beach, a tropical mangrove swamp, and underwater viewing areas. The statement said: The next stage is to find homes for the animals. Living Coasts is part of a world-wide network of zoos and aquariums and we will be looking for homes for the animals within them once movement restrictions have been lted.Most of the animals kept at Living Coasts are marine species that will need specialist facilities. Living Coast is confident that good new homes for the animals will be found, but at present it is unclear how long this process may take. Following the announcement, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariumstold The Independent: “This is a huge blow to the conservation community and another devastating impact of the coronavirus. “BIAZA’s thoughts are with everyone at Living Coasts and the Wild Planet Trust at this challenging time,” it added.

But the determined -year-old ignored his advice and is now the proud owner of Cocoa Girl and Cocoa Boy, having spotted a gap in the market. Serlina came up with the idea when she was looking for magazines to buy for her six-year-old daughter to read as part of her home-schooling plans during the lockdown and saw none featured black kids. The childcare worker, who lives in south London with her husband and two children, told : I donapost normally buy childrenaposs magazines but I thought itaposs lockdown and Iaposm going to need some extra things for my six-year-old daughter to do. I was looking on the shelves and I couldnapost find any magazines with any black children in it. I tried to look for magazines online but there was nothing with no representation of black children. I had been working in the publishing industry for  years and I knew this could be done. When I told a male colleague I used to work with about my plans he told not to do a magazine focussed on black culture. He said no one will be interested and I should broaden my spec but thereaposs lots of magazines out there but none about black culture. For me itaposs really important that there are publications out there at this time to empower our black children and teach others about the culture.  These magazines arenapost geared just for black children they are for children from all races as it teaches them about the black culture and black history. There are also features about dferent cultures from all around the world to educate children of all races. This is dferent as thereaposs nothing like this on the market. Serlina is no stranger to launching magazines as she was in the team that started Vera - the inflight magazine for Virgin Airlines - which first came to print in September . She has also worked on household publications such as Marie Claire and Woman and launched her own magazine called aposFresh Healthapos for new mums and their babies. She said: I spoke to my daughter and we decided to go for it.  It would teach my daughter some new skills during lockdown and I wanted her to think she was in control too as it would help her self-esteem. Due to the lockdown restrictions Serlina was unable to recruit outside help for the magazineaposs launch so she roped in her award-winning photographer husband and used her daughter as the face of the first Cocoa Girl. We couldnapost do a casting call, she said. My husband wasnapost getting any work because of the lockdown and I wasnapost looking after children so it became a nice family project. Because itaposs lockdown I wrote the contents but I have a professional team of sub-editors and a company that publishes the magazine for me. We have lots of dferent sections in the magazine. Thereaposs something for children with all interests including an inspirational section with girls who are doing things such as making their own hair butter, a section to show children how to grew their own plants and vegetables. Thereaposs a girl showing you how to bake and a black history section.  In the next edition children will be writing the content and weaposll have a special section that celebrates black hair, and a Cocoa excellence section that showcases black role models so weaposll be focussing on Mary Seacole and Martin Luther King. The magazine industry may have suffered a downturn due to people switching to online content and the lockdown battering its advertising revenue but Serlina said the unique content of her magazines makes it a winner. I donapost think print is dead itaposs the content that being put out there thataposs dead, she said. When the magazine was printed I showed it to friends and family and they said they had never seen anything like it before and placed orders. They told me I need to get it out there for everyone. Serlina had already pencilled in an official launch date for the magazines but the death of George Floyd in the US catapulted race issues in the media spotlight which made her realise they could be more crucial than ever. After the death of George Floyd the world changed as people wanted to listen to the black community, she said.  I hope Cocoa Boy can address stereotypes out there about black boys that they are hooligans and badly behaved and inspires them to greatness and excellence, she said. We want to give black boys hope that they can achieve great things.In anticipation of the official launch next month Serlina put the two covers of Cocoa Girl and Cocoa Boy on her Facebook page with the link to the website where orders can be made and she said she has not looked back since.She said: My phone didnapost stop going off with all the sales. I was selling a magazine a minute. I was planning to open a nursery but thataposs been put on hold because the magazine has really taken off.

The former manager of the department store in Cambridge was given the drug in tablet form from early in his stay, and daily thereafter. He was well enough to be discharged on May .

They said would I like to do a trial  They didnapost say what drug and it could have been one of three or four because they were trying dferent ones, which I agreed to. Obviously he gave me the right one.  There was no magic switch, it was a gradual coming back really. It wasnapost anything overnight. Mr Herring said doctors were close to putting him on a ventilator but they found that giving him oxygen through a face mask worked. They said aposWell, we will have to put you on a ventilator but we will just try this mask and seethat worksapos, which it did, thank goodness, he said. I wouldnapost have enjoyed going on a ventilator.  Askedhe believed dexamethasone helped save his le, he said: Definitely. He added: Iaposm here to tell the story and Iaposm really thankful to the NHS for that. Itaposs really, really good.

The endangered African Penguin was unable to stand, found it hard to breathe and became extremely weak. Alarmed medics rushed her to intensive care, where they discovered she was suffering from pneumonia and a painful mass in her chest. The bird, who lives at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, US, was given antibiotics to help her recovery - but workers feared she would not pull through. Desperate for anything which could help her back to health, they called on her lovesick soulmate to lend them a hand. Dottie and partner Stanley were usually inseparable, and vets thought that bringing him to her side would give her a boost. Stanley was first brought in for an hour a day when she was most poorly, but was gradually able to spend more time with Dottie. Very soon he was visiting throughout the day to encourage her to eat. The National Aviary’s director of veterinary medicine, Dr Pilar Fish, told KDKA: At first, Stan came for one-hour visits in the ICU each day, which was all Dottie could manage in her weakened state. As Dottie regained her strength, the visits became longer and longer, and eventually Stan moved in to the ICU. Stan worked in tandem with the team who visited throughout the day to encourage Dottie to eat. Dr Fish said Stan would sit with Dottie as penguin experts fed her - and keepers believe the companionship helped her make a full recovery.  He said: When Stan ate, Dottie would take a bite.” And incredibly, the duo have now ed to their colony, where they were welcomed by their penguin pals months after Dottie first fell ill.

So far sheaposs had numerous cosmetic procedures to her lips, cheeks, chin, and jawline, as well as an eyebrow lt, lt lip, two nose jobs, veneers and Botox. She wants a full head-to-toe transformation, and is willing to go to extreme s to get her dream appearance. She said: “Facial feminisation is one of my big procedures I have planned as I’m trans and have certain features on my face that I don’t like. Although I’ve been changing my appearance for a few years now, I know this is just the start for me! I’m doing a full head-to-toe transformation, I want to go very extreme with my face like Pete Burns and Amanda Lapore. Sofia, from Lancashire, hopes her next surgery, which sheaposs planning to travel to Florida for, will give her her dream boobs. But getting her dream look isnapost cheap, and Sofia has come up with an unusual way to make cash.  She makes thousands of pounds each month by sharing saucy photos of herself online, specialising in financially degrading men. She started off working as an escort then realised she could make extra cash with the unusual approach which sees men pay her to demand money from them. She said: I started off escorting then quickly realised there is this whole world of findomand cash pigs and cash slaves.  My mind was blown and I’ve not looked back since. Just this morning I woke up to a text from a guy asking methere’s anything he’d like me to do today. I told him, ‘yes, start by emptying your bank account into mine and then I want you to write lines saying, I must obey goddess Sofia Lips’ and he sent me £ and is still writing lines. She had some very bizarre requests since starting the unusual role, and she claims that some men just ask to meet her at cashpoints. They enter their pin and allow her to withdraw however much money she likes. She said: Some men are very strange.

His denial came as it emerged girlsapos swimwear and , child abuse images were found by police investigating -year-old German suspect Christian Brueckner. His lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said he has spoken to the convicted rapist who is currently in solitary confinement in a German jail. Mr Fulscher was asked directlyhis client had anything to do with Madeleine’s abduction, and replied that Brueckner “denied any involvement”. But he refused to say anything further beyond the denial as it emerged police found items of children’s clothing, including several girls’ swimsuits, in a Tfin Allegro motor home that Brueckner used in Germany.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.       Six USB sticks with , vile child abuse images were also found among the bones of a dead dog at his derelict home in Germany. The existence of the Winnebago-style motor home was revealed in a German TV documentary on Monday night. The motor home was never seen in Portugal, where he had a campervan and a black Jaguar.In Portugal, friends of Madeleine’s parents Gerry and Kate McCann accused German police of “playing games” with the heartbroken couple by failing to reveal what evidence they have that she is no longer alive. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters confirmed he had written to the couple saying that Madeleine is dead – but without revealing how this was known. The McCanns said they had not yet received the letter. German prosecutors have also said they are investigating the suspect for murder. A source close to the McCanns said the time had come for prosecutors to tell them what they know. The source added: “It’s like Hans Christian Wolters is playing funny games with the McCanns, without being funny. Those close to the McCanns are getting really mad with the German approach.  “If this German prosecutor is insistent in his belief that Madeleine is dead, it’s time her parents were told what the evidence is.” Kate and Gerry, from Rothley, Leics, have remained silent on the row between police forces involved in the investigation. But it is very unusual for a close associate of the couple to criticise investigators in this way – and highlights the frustration they feel as answers have yet to be found  years after their daughter vanished.  Portuguese authorities have begged criminal friends of Brueckner to come forward – promising them immunity from prosecution. It comes as it emerged Brueckner could be released from prison on July the European Court of Justice overturns his conviction for raping a -year-old American woman in Praia da Luz, the resort where Madeleine vanished in May , at the age of three. He is challenging the conviction because German police extradited him from Portugal for a separate drugs conviction, but then put him on trial for rape.His lawyers are arguing that this was illegal. The ruling is set to be made on July  in a hearing that has been fast-tracked because of the unusual circumstances of the case. There are three potential outcomes of any ECJ ruling. The first is that the Portuguese could give retrospective permission for the extradition on the rape charge, so that the conviction stands and Brueckner stays inside for his seven-year sentence.  The second is that the ECJ could order a retrial of the rape. The third possibility is that the judge could rule there should not have been a trial, the conviction is overturned, Brueckner is released and he cannot be rearrested. He could then potentially leave and go to a country that does not have an extradition agreement with Germany.

German expert Dr Mark Benecke, who once examined Adolf and Eva Hitleraposs skulls in Moscow, suspects Christian Brueckner is a narcissist with an antisocial personality disorder. Brueckneraposs previous convictions for violence point towards classic psychopathic crimes, and the ages of his victims suggest it is more about power than a sexual liking of a particular age group, said Dr Benecke. Many violent criminals who prey on children are in fact total weaklings, choosing easier targets such as kids or the elderly because those victims put up less of a fight, the expert added.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Dr Benecke, a university lecturer who has been an expert witness in criminal trials around the world, told : Since he committed so many dferent offences he might have an antisocial personality disorder. He might be psychopathic, which means antisocial plus narcissistic personality disorder. A chilling portrait has emerged of Brueckner since he was identied as the chief suspect in the McCann case He has almost  convictions in Germany for crimes including sexually abusing two girls, raping a -year-old woman, drug trafficking and theft.  Previous girlfriends claim he was violent towards them and former neighbours and friends claim he made cryptic comments about Madeleine and children, had a -year-old girlfriend when he was in his s, was aggressive and threatening towards them, and threw drug and booze-fuelled parties. It has emerged police found girlsapos swimwear, childrenaposs clothes and , child abuse images - showing the abuse of infants, children and adolescents - while investigating the child sex predator four years ago. Brueckner does not have any children. Police found about  pictures of Brueckner partly naked or wearing black stockings and committing a sex act. Officers were looking for the body of five-year-old Inga Gehricke, who vanished in a forest near Stendal, northern Germany, in May . Nine months after she disappeared, officers raided a disused factory site near Braunschweig, which Brueckner had bought six years earlier at auction. Germany’s Spiegel TV revealed in a documentary that police seized a red and white Tfin Allegro Bay motor home in May , as part of the investigation into the disappearance of Inga, the so-called German Maddie. During a six-day examination of the site, police also found computer memory sticks with more than , files, mostly containing pictures and videos of child abuse, the documentary said.  The items were in a carrier bag buried beneath the body of Brueckner’s dog. Police claim they also discovered an online chat where he told someone he wanted to catch something little and use it for days, record maaaany videos clips and document in detail how sheaposs being tortured. Brueckner also allegedly boasted the motorhome he owned and drove repeatedly between Germany and Portugal was ideal for hiding “drugs and children”. He was charged in relation to the child abuse images, but not in relation to Inga, who went missing during a family picnic and has never been found.  After Brueckner was named the prime suspect in the McCann case, police forces across Europe began taking another look at unsolved child disappearances or murders, and rapes of women. In Germany, police are reviewing several cases, including the disappearance of Inga. Brueckner lived in rundown homes in Portugal and when Maddie vanished he was living a transient lestyle in a VW camper van. When he was in the Algarve he worked in a bar and fixed up cars for cash. But prosecutors say he became a drter and supplemented his income through burglaries and theft. A former neighbour said Brueckner in a disgusting and absolutely vile farm building near Praia da Luz, the same resort where Madeleine disappeared in May , and left behind wigs and exotic clothing when he abruptly moved out.  The ex-neighbour told Sky News: “He arrived in the mid-s and rented the place from the English owner. He went back to Germany at one stage and moved another German guy in to look after it, then came back and threw him out on the street. “He was always a bit angry, driving fast up and down the lane. And then one day, around , he just disappeared without a word. I think he left some rent unpaid. Born Christian Fischer in , Brueckner spent time in a childrenaposs home and was adopted by Brigitte and Fritz Brueckner, who later sent him away after he got into trouble, according to neighbours.  Neighbours said the couple were unable to control him and sent him to a reform school for delinquent teenagers in Wurzburg. As an adult he has split his time between Portugal and Germany, where he ran a kiosk in Braunschweig and had a -year-old girlfriend when he was in his s. German prosecutors have described the suspect as a child sex predator. He was convicted in Germany of sexually abusing two girls in Germany - one when he was just  - and of raping the -year-old American woman in Praia da Luz. Brueckner entered her flat at night and tied her up before raping her and beating her with a weapon as he filmed the carefully planned attack in September .  Last December, he was sentenced to seven years in a German prison after the attack went unsolved for almost  years. Cologne-based Dr Benecke, , said: His previouspoint towards classic psychopathic crimes on the one hand, but it might also be more due to a possible drug habit. Of course, both or all three - drugs plus antisocial plus narcissistic traits - can mix. The age range of Brueckneraposs victims - from young girls to a pensioner - means it might be more about power than about a particular age group he likes sexually, said Dr Benecke.  The expert added: Some offenders even deny the sexual part and insist it was only about the apospureapos abuse, killing, stealing etc. For example, Samuel Little, a recent case from the US, said so. Little, now  and in prison, is the most prolic serial killer in US history, recently confessing to almost  murders that took place between  and . Dr Benecke added: Also, many offenders are not paedophiles but just use a person that may resist less since they, the offenders, are total weaklings.  I had cases like this where the offenders really just picked kids because the kids could be convinced more easily to come with the offenders because the offenders were not actual paedophiles, just extremely soft, weak, unexperienced, aposlimpapos personalities, far away from psychopathy. Careful planning suggests Brueckner is most likely a narcissist - an I am better than anybody -type who thinks all others are idiots - and antisocial, said Dr Benecke. The antisocial traits reflect a person with a mindset of I do not care about the needs of others, my needs are all that is of relevance, he added. How to get a confession  Investigators face an uphill battle in trying to get any information from their suspect, who is in solitary confinement in jail to protect him from fellow inmates. Brueckneraposs lawyer has said the suspect will refuse to answer questions because German prosecutors must produce proof he was involved in Maddieaposs disappearance.  Lawyer Friedrich Fulscher told the Mirror he asked Brueckner about the McCann case and his client denied any involvement. Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was just three years old when she vanished from her familyaposs holiday apartment in Praia da Luz  years ago. German prosecutors suspect she is dead, but have said they do not know where her body is and they do not have enough evidence to charge anyone with murder. Dr Benecke said investigators will probably need to work Brueckner to make him feel as though he is the smartest person in the room and that he stands to gain something from speaking. He added:need the feeling of being more clever than anybody  and to get something out of it - higher status, money, deals, for example. Sometimes, they also cooperate - like Juergen Bartsch, Samuel Little and Luis Garavito, who even drew us a map with all the corpses - because the want to tell their story... in a proud manner that shows how aposcleverapos they are. Also, it is important to understand the true motives. True paedophile  True sexual reasons  Because,not, they will consider the interviewer to be an idiot. Dr Benecke is the only forensic scientist to work on the case of Luis Garavito, one of the worldaposs worst serial killers.

Players pick up on that.“Having Gordon Strachan and Jimmy Nicholl’s experience is fantastic as well.“We might have our playing experience but they have  years more experience in the game than any of us. That’s invaluable.”Irvine and Mackay work closely together at Dundee – but it’s not the first time they have worked together.Dee first team coach, Mackay, was brought to St Johnstone by Derek McInnes while Irvine was the Perth side’s first choice right back.In the end, Mackay went on to be come a club legend at McDiarmid, while Irvine moved on to Dundee.But there are no hard feelings from Irvine, who has loved every minute of his time at Dens Park.He said: “Dave Mackay came in from Livingston in [St Johnstone’s] first season in the SPL to add competition for places. I was unfortunate because I’d chosen to have surgery to tidy up an ankle problem that had niggled me.“The plan was that would tie in with the close season and I could start pre-season.“But it hindered me and I was behind with my fitness and struggled a bit to get back to form.“Dave, obviously, came in and did well and I think him being able to play in a few positions helped him, too.“I recognised at that time, being in my mid-s I wanted to be playing every week and I wouldn’t get that at St Johnstone.“I’ve nothing against Del, that’s the decisions that have to be made to win games – when Dave came in, the manager couldn’t guarantee me games and I heard there was interest from Dundee.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The football was great. But the referee  Awful!What’s the Spanish for: “You don’t know what you’re doing” For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly.

time supported by a comprehensive health strategy which has been led by our medical team.ldquoWithout question we have had to think dferently about the remainder of our  season which is reflected in todayrsquos announcement.ldquoAs golfrsquos global Tour, ersity is ordinarily one of our biggest strengths, but in this instance it has become one of our biggest challenges.ldquoInitially, therefore, based on the expert guidance we received, playing in clusters, in one territory, is the best option in terms of testing, travel and accommodation.It is the second year in a row that the competition has been played at the East Lothian course.Last yearrsquos event was won by Bernd Wiesberger after a play-off with Benjamin Hebert.Among those hoping to line up at the tournament is North Berwicks Grant Forrest.The -year-old, who finished tied for rd at least years event, said: \"It is great it is going ahead.\"Obviously, so much uncertainty in the last few months and the guys on the European Tour have been working really hard to put something together for us.\"I am glad they have got it on the schedule and I hope the weather is alright in October ndash who knows what it could be like \"There was a point where I thought it would almost be a year off, which would have been a real shame.\"They have done really well to give us so many events already and with the hope they could add a few more.\"Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Councilrsquos spokesman for economic development and tourism, was pleased to hear the event had been rescheduled.He said: ldquoI very much look forward to welcoming world class golfers back to East Lothian for this fantastic tournament.\"We will of course work closely with the European Tour and in accordance with guidance on the detail of how the tournament can be run safely.\"It is an encouraging development and signals that Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast will be back open for business this year albeit with some restrictions still in place.Councillor Jeremy Findlay, who represents the North Berwick Coastal ward, was similarly pleased to see the event rescheduled but stressed it remained to be seen how the tournament would look in terms of a crowd.He said: \"I think it is great news not only for Scottish golf itself but for tourism in general.\"Hopefully, by then, we will be able to have crowds as well but I am really not sure what the rules on that are going to be yet ndash whether it is crowds or played behind closed doors, it would be a bit oddit was behind closed doors.\"In general, we will have to wait and see what the rules are about crowds.\"That is what produces the benefit in the short-term to the local economy.\"Mr Findlay highlighted that the tourism sector had taken \"a huge hit\" during the coronavirus crisis and many businesses would have to survive until next year before tourism started to resume in the traditional way.Currently, the Aberdeen Standard Investments Ladies Scottish Open is pencilled in for August - at the same venue.Last yearrsquos event was won by Mi Jung Hur."},{"url":null,"title":"water-lovers-paradise-look-new-plans","story":"A water park, with the opportunity to swim and kayak, is part of the proposals revealed by the local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the

But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

Irsquom sure most of us were relatively content and secure before this. Telling the majority of the population what to think and say while denigrating their history and achievements has not worked out as planned and stled any potential conciliation.The SNP has tried to erase parts of British identity and history in Scotland with a slow-burning and semi-planned vehemence. It continues to jump on any popular, virtue signalling, social-justice bandwagon where convenient and politically prudent while ignoring endemic human rights issues in genuine authoritarian regimes.Such anger wasnt a feature on the Scottish political and cultural landscape a decade ago. What changed  Whorsquos in charge David Bone, Girvan.JIM Sillarss absurd suggestion that the British state should pay reparations for the slave trade to ethnic minoritiesdisplays ignorance of both historical facts and praxis.Contrary to the myth, British slavery was not a uniquely \"black\" experience. Romanichal Gypsies along with other itinerants and \"undesirables\" were shipped from Henry VIIIs time as slaves to the colonies, some sold to freed blacks in the West Indies. On slavery few historically have clean hands.For two centuries, the Colliers and SaltersAct  made all miners de facto slaves of mine owners until released or death. More than , Britons from coastal areas were enslaved by the Barbary Corsairs over three centuries until the mid-th ndash to say nothing of the three centuries of Scandinavian and Irish Viking slave raids.In counterbalance, Britain remains the only world nation to establish a military force to destroy international slavery, the Royal Navys West Africa Squadron, which over years freed over   black slaves.The notion of black slavery reparations seems to me to be white middle-class virtue signalling at its worst.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.LIKE many people, I am sure, I have felt somewhat ambivalent at the sight of statues being toppled or public monuments being defaced as part of the anti-racist movement sweeping the world. While sharing the sentiments of those directly involved, I canrsquot help feeling that there has to be a better, less crude way of highlighting the vile past behaviour of some of our most prominent fellow countrymen. They should indeed be named and shamed but does removing a statue erected in their \"honour\" really achieve anything other than erasing them from the historical record in the most visible way As a retired teacher, I firmly believe that the educational process offers a much more fruitful and positive way ahead. Many schools recognise and honour the sacrices of our young men ndash whilst highlighting the folly of war ndash by organising regular trips to the First World War battlefields and cemeteries. Similarly, the funded programme of annual visits to Auschwitz involving groups of secondary pupils has been an extremely powerful way of ensuring that one of the most horric episodes in human history is never forgotten.With respect to slavery, in the absence of a suitable \"location\" to visit, a dferent approach could be adopted. All of our major cities ndash particularly those that benefited the most from the slave trade ndash should have a permanent exhibition charting in full detail the history of the slave trade . This would, ideally, be housed within an existing museum already benefiting from an established footfall. Pupils from all primary and secondary schools would be invited to visit on a structured, educational visit as part of a unit of work which would be a compulsory inclusion in the curriculum. In this way, all of our young people would benefit from a true and accurate account of this most nefarious period in our history. The phrase \"lest we forget\" applies equally well in this context.Rob Kelly, Bearsden.WITH the current national protests associated with the injustice of slavery and transportation of black slaves from West Africa to British colonies to harvest sugar in the plantations, it has been interesting to reflect on the Scottish connections.What is little known, however, is the inclusion of Scots, as slaves, in this period of history.In  more than  Scots were being sent to the West Indies as slaves from Edinburgh. The small ship sank in a storm off Orkney. The men had no chance as they were allowed to drown, battened below in the hold.Their crime was that they were Covenanters, unwilling to accept bishops in their Scottish Presbyterian faith, imposed by the established Episcopalian Church. Hunted down, they resorted to having church services in fields, particularly in the south of Scotland. Some were tied to stakes and allowed to drown slowly in the rising tide of the Solway Firth.My interest is that my ancestors, John and James Kirk, were two of the slaves drownedPerhaps we should accept that we cannot change history, just learn from it.John Kirk Ewing, Ayr.THE vandalising of Robert the Bruces statue at Bannockburn on the bogus grounds that he was a racist is instructive as well as disgraceful.The attack on Bruces statue when he lived  years ago and almost certainly never even saw an African person shows that this has nothing to do with racism.Instead, we have to look at the wider pattern. Statues of Churchill and Lincoln have been vandalised in London, and of Robert Dundas in Edinburgh. A bronze of Lord Baden-Powell is under guard in Poole. When even Queen Victorias statue in Leeds has been attacked, it is clear that it is sufficient to be famous, dead and white.The real objective of these attacks is to erase our cultural identity. If these acts were done by foreigners, they would be recognised as genocidal in intent.We should concede nothing to the extremists using the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis as cover for attempted Maoist cultural revolution.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe.OH that people would learn some history before pegging trivial debating points on wild mis-statements. Robert Bruce did not gain the Scottish crown by cold-blooded murder. His slaying of John Comyn, which is what I assume Duncan Soomanhas in mind, was recognised at the time as a killing committed in the heat of passion: a crime and a sin, of course, but a much lesser one than premeditated murder. Both church and secular laws in mediaeval times were perfectly clear about the moral and legal distinction. All recent historians concur in this interpretation of Brucersquos act.Furthermore, far from gaining him the Scottish crown, the killing made his eventual success in this even more astonishing, since it plunged him into a full-scale civil war in Scotland on top of the ongoing war with England.

to the pattern seen across the UK as a whole in the first weeks of the lockdown.\"When viewed across the two months of March and April, the total fall in output since February is provisionally

Itrsquos still out there.ldquoWe see in other countries right now ndash China is dealing with a new outbreak, some parts of America are seeing cases going up again.ldquoSo itrsquos still a big danger and that means wersquove still got to be careful and take things step by step, which actually it gets harder for me to persuade people of that the more we see levels of the infection reduce, but actually it continues to be really important that we donrsquot get reckless and take too many steps too quickly that then allows it to spread again.During the Capital Scotland radio show Ms Sturgeon was also asked how she looks after her own mental and emotional wellbeing.She said: ldquoItrsquos been dficult I guess over the last wee while because I have been so busy trying to deal with this day by day but Irsquove got a great husband at home who, you know, helps to look after me and make sure Irsquom not getting too stressed out about things.ldquoAnd I suppose, every now and again, Irsquove just tried to take a step back and try to focus on the positives, which during a time like this is not easy to do but there have been positives out of this.ldquoI think the sense of collective and community spirit that we found over the past three months has been really inspiring.ldquoWersquove all done the right thing not just for ourselves but for each other and I hope as we come out of the crisis and get back to normal, we donrsquot lose all of that, that we actually remember that, you know, whether itrsquos enjoying spending a bit more time with immediate family in your own household, or just getting off the treadmill a little bit for some people, that we just remember what really matters in le.

Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them.

This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon.

It has allowed the waste crews to collect recyclables that have been stored in folks’ houses, whilst ensuring that our crews are able to work within the requirements of physical distancing.

This should be contained in a single green bin or box.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineDavid Whiteford, Chair of the North Highland Initiative, wants the guidelines eased to help businesses reliant on the visitor trade.Last week the Scottish Government’s Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing, set a provisional date of th July for tourism businesses to resume operations.Mr Ewing said the date would be “dependent on public health advice and progression to phase three of the Scottish Government lock-down route-map”.Mr Whiteford said he believed anxieties would be easedthe Scottish Government now dropped its ‘stay at home’ message.He added: “The ‘stay home and save lives’ message has been very effective, but for many people, especially those living in more remote and rural communities, there is a fear that changing this behaviour may pose a risk to public health and wellbeing.“Our famous ‘Highland Welcome’ is at risk of becoming tarnished, affecting tourism long term.“We now need the Scottish Government to implement a national and local campaign to allay anxiety amongst local Highland communities and deliver a positive, uplting message as we take safe, measured steps to emerge from lockdown.“We need to look at what other countries have done with social distancing by reducing it from two metres to one metre.“It’s the only way that many tourism and hospitality businesses will be viable.”Since it was launched in , the rebranding of the coastal road network as the NC has been credited with bosting businesses in the region by as much as  per cent year on year.However, along with the rapid growth came concerns over road and infrastructure problems along the route.The initiative has also faced accusations of turning the route into a race track, from which many small businesses see little benefit from visitors who tend to pass through, rather than stop. July will be ‘of little benefit’ to tourism businesses in the islandstravel restrictions remain in place beyond that date.The Chief Executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob McKinnon, said last week’s announcement “was a welcome sign that the end of a long and tough period of lock-down is approaching, and gives businesses a fighting chance of making it through to .”But he suggested thatcurrent ferry restrictions remained # with the Loch Seaforth limited to  passengers per sailing # customers won’t be able to get to the islands.”Comhairle nan Eilean Siar confirmed last week that island authorities #are involved in discussions# regarding any proposed amendments to travel restrictions on ferries to and from the islands.The Comhairle said it is “seeking clarication” on eligibility for travel as restrictions are gradually eased “with a preference for island residents and essential travellers being the priority in the initial stages”.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/APC-1.jpg","title":"saoil nach e co obrachadh seach farmad a ni","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCarson a tha sinn farpaiseach, a bheil a h-uile cultar farpaiseach, agus dè tha e ciallachadh Tha fhios againn uile gu bheil farpaisean anns gach àite agus anns gach raon: farpaisean eadar sgiobaidhean buill-coise farpaisean iomain farpaisean tennis farpaisean snàmh farpaisean chon-chaaorach farpaisean seinn is ciùilfarpaisean gàirnealarachdfarpaisean phoilitigeach aig àm nan taghaidhean farpais gach latha eadar Am Pàrtaidh Tòraidhean is Làborach is Nàiseantach is uaine is eile farpais eadar bhancaichean – cò is fheàrrBanca na h-Alba no Banca Riòghail na h-Alba  – farpais eadar am BBC agus ITV son luchd-amhairc a thàladh, farpais eadar eileanan mu dheidhinn cò an t-eilean as bòidhche, agus mar sin air adhart agus mar sin air adhart.Smaoinich fhèin air na gaisgich a tha sinn air togail suas ann an eachdraidh o chionns gun do ghlèidh iad ann am farpais.Sgioba Celtic a rinn an gnothach air Inter Milan ann an Cuach na h-Eòrpa ann an .Jesse Owens a ghlèidh ceithir Buinn Òir anns na h-Oiliompaics am Berlin ann an .Calum Ceanadach a ghlèidh Buinn Òir a’ Chomainn Ghàidhealaich ann an  agus Duais Seinn na Cruinne ann am Mosgo ann an .Martina Navratilova a ghlèidh Wimbledon grunn thursan.Gary Kasparov a choisinn Farpais Tàileisg an t-Saoghail grunn thursan.Dòmhnall Beag MacLeòid is Iain Burgess is iomadh pìobaire eile a ghlèidh iomadh farpais.Tha farpaisean àraidh ann gun teagamh.Tha an nighean agam, Brìghde, an-dràsta ri linn a’ ghlasaidh a’ teagasg na pìoba do bheagan dhaoine air feadh an t-saoghail, agus dh’inns i dhomh an latha roimhe gun do ghlèidh fear a tha i teagasg thall ann an Aimearagaidh Duais Pìoba nan Stàitean Aaonaichte an uiridh.Ach chan ann air a’ phìob mhòr no air a’ phìob bhig ach air a’ phìob-chrèadha!

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

We have worked hard to make sure that clear signage and extra help will be there to guide them through the changes we have made to allow for social distancing.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCustomers wear masks as they shopPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCustomers wear masks as they shopWe are also asking customers to respect the measures we have put in place to help ensure shopping at Primark is an enjoyable, safe experience for everyone.This is the second time in  months that Primark has had to reopen stores in Belfast after a long absence.They began trading from their two current Belfast properties in the aftermath of the huge fire that threatened to destroy their flagship Bank Buildings premises.The damage caused by the inferno was so extensive that it forced the temporary closure of  surrounding shops and its legacy is still being felt today.

Travellers are feeling the impact, but sotoo are pilots and flight attendants. #It#s hard after  years to write up my CV and think where it leads to outside aviation#Former Flybe pilot Nigel Best , from Ballymena, has worked for the airline for  years and transferred from his role as an engineer to become a pilot six years ago. He is married with two children and a grandson. He worked in Michelin as an apprentice after leaving school and then became an apprentice engineer in the RAF.I served for  years with the RAF and then joined Jersey European as a CAA licensed engineer. I did that for  years, but I always had my pilot#s licence and I built upon that and became a flight instructor, he says.Nigel says initial flight training costs £,: It#s a big investment. When you are a pilot it#s not just like you get a licence like a driving licence. Every six months you#ve got to do a simulator test and there are always tests and evaluations. My licence now will only last for a year and I will have to renew it at my own expense.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNigel Best  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNigel Best On his days off he also worked at Woodgate Aviation for the Air Ambulance on a voluntary basis.After six years as a pilot his last flight was on March , bringing passengers from Manchester into Belfast.I know everybody puts so much effort into their job, but everybody within Flybe, from the cabin crew and engineer to the pilots, worked so hard. It was also a very family-oriented business. Everybody knew each other and everybody was there for each other. People had worked there for  years or more and they loved serving the people of Northern Ireland, he says.Since lockdown, Nigel has been doing DIY projects using his engineering skills, and has been looking for work.I#ll probably go back to engineering, there#s more likelihood of me getting an engineer#s job in Northern Ireland, he adds.He says the highlight of his career was when he flew his family on a scheduled flight to London City Airport for his we#s grandmother#s th birthday, fulfilling her letime ambition of visiting the Cha Flower Show.He also loved sharing his knowledge as an engineer with first officers working alongside him in the cockpit.To me it was just the sheer fact that I never went to sleep at night dreading that I had to go to work the next morning.The worst aspect was always the threat of redundancy. Aviation is always the first industry that reacts quickly to a downturn and an upturn. Because of the cost in aviation you have to act very quickly and those who react the quickest are the ones who survive.It#s hard after  years to write up my CV, look at all the experience in my background and think where this leads to outside aviation.Nigel believes that Flybe employees lost their jobs as a result of Covid- because Virgin Atlantic, which had bought over the business, decided to focus on its own brand.Flybe was connecting people, families, businesses within the British Isles and that has now been lost, he adds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhilip Land with his late father Paul FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhilip Land with his late father Paul‘I would cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again... it was an amazing experience but things will be dferent’Philip Land , from Lisburn, was a flight attendant for Flybe until the airline went into administration just before lockdown. He is married to Karl. Following a career in hospitality, Philip was working at a catering company in Belfast City Airport when he was encouraged to apply for a cabin crew position by crew stopping for lunch.“I’d always wanted to be a cabin crew, but because of my age and height, I didn’t think I would be suitable,” he says.“But I went to the assessment day and passed — that was three years ago and I was a cabin crew member from March that year. It’s been the most brilliant time.”Philip describes Flybe’s employees as being like a family. “My best day was the first day I flew on what is called ‘fam day’, short for familiarisation, when I had to fly home in the jump seat, the third seat in the cockpit, for the whole of the flight from Southampton to Belfast and that was absolutely amazing — it’s not something that you normally get to do, to see what the captain and the pilots do.“You get to see the take-off and the landing and you’re watching the ground coming closer and closer — it’s absolutely amazing.”Philip, a rep for Unite the Union, was on a health and safety course in Carlisle when he learned that Flybe had closed down.“I spent all night talking to members on the phone — they were like brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts. It had to be the worst day of my le, the loss of that job,” he says.“I never realised until it was coming to an end how much it takes over your le. I loved going to work.“The company went into administration on March  and the following week, the country started to go into lockdown. We were dealing with our members, trying to get them sorted, updating their CVs and making sure all monies were arranged. We had a two-week period of manic activity, trying to get people organised, and all of a sudden it was locked down and you couldn’t do it anymore.”After going into lockdown, Philip fell ill and was in self-isolation for nearly four weeks.“I had every symptom, other than the cough — a sore chest, my body was so sore, I couldn’t even get out of bed most days. I don’t know whether it was the mental exhaustion after two weeks of living on adrenaline rushes. Karl had a cough, but nothing untoward, but he wasn’t right — we both definitely weren’t right.“I’ve had many, many bad colds when I was flying — you pick up anything that is going around — but that had to be the worst. “Six of us that had been in the same group all had symptoms and we all feel we had some form of coronavirus, but you can’t get tested as you are just a number to this government.”After recovering, Philip has spent the time in lockdown painting and decorating and taken part in weekly Zoom quizzes with friends, but has barely left the house.“My father, Paul Land, was a Cha pensioner in London and he got Covid and died on April . My brother had to arrange a virtual cremation for him,” he says.“Things have been hard. I am a mental health first-aider, which has been a lesaver for me, because there are times when you just think... why ”Philip says that unless Flybe s or is replaced with a small regional airline, he can’t see himself being able to work in the airline industry again.“My concern is that there is so little connectivity now with the mainland from Belfast. We don’t have the bridge Boris Johnson is talking about, we don’t have a tunnel to get across. WI’d cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again. It was an amazing experience, but it’s going to take time for it to settle down and how are they going to work with self-distancing “If they’re doing a deep clean for each flight, that’s at least an hour. Things are going to be very dferent.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year‘If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over...but I may go home to my family’Caoimhe Leigh Harkin , from Co Tyrone, has been a flight attendant with Emirates since last March and has been in lockdown in Dubai. She originally graduated in journalism in  before working as a travel journalist in Dublin, but was keen to travel before settling down. She was hired by Emirates in February last year after attending an open day.“Before all of this, the job has been wonderful. I have loved the travel and the whole experience,” she says.“I’ve been to Australia, Italy, South Africa, and I’ve done some amazing things. I’ve been to Bali, Mauritius — I’ve been to places I would probably never have been toI hadn’t taken the job. I thought, ‘If I don’t do this now, I’ll never do it’.“With Emirates, every day is so dferent. You have  days off a month in Dubai and you do seven or eight flights, some of which are layovers, or they could be turnaround flights, where you leave Dubai that day and come back that night.“It’s been the best year of my le — there’s literally no words to describe it. The hardest thing is jet lag and being sleep deprived — you just sleep when you can. But when you’re going into a layover for  hours when it’s somewhere you’ve never been before, you just have to go and see that place and do without the sleep.”Caoimhe lives in an Emirates-owned accommodation tower along with many other crew members.“We’ve made a wee family out here — me and my best friends live in the towers beside each other. Every day is dferent, there’s something always going on in Dubai.”At the start of the pandemic, the city was in -hour lockdown with tighter restrictions than in the UK, she says.“We needed a permit even to get groceries and you only got the permit once every three days. You had to input your UEA identication andyou went before your three days was up, you got declined.

They literally have drones going round the streets sterilising them —only everywhere could do it the way Dubai does it,” Caoimhe says.Her last flight was on March  and she has been in lockdown ever since, and found it hard to adjust to a less active lestyle.But with the relaxation in lockdown, she was able to book a hotel in the city and stay there for five nights with some friends.“It has a suite with a private pool and the views are amazing over the skyline of Dubai,” Caominhe says.“We have our own rooms, but we’re able to spend time together, which is nice. The hotel is only for residents of Dubai. We have to be in by pm and can’t leave the hotel until am, and we’re still sticking to the guidelines because we’re not in one room. The past five days have been really nice, but it’s back to reality tomorrow.”Caominhe says Emirates is bringing staff back in phases.“There’s a lot of negativity in the news about other airlines, but Emirates don’t have that at all... they’re making people stay on top of their safety procedures before we get started back.“We’re on standby and you have to be preparedyou’re called for a flight. If you’re called to do a flight, you have to quarantine for  days afterwards.”But she says she’s not sure what to do in the long term. Her contract lasts for three years and Caoimhe wasn’t intending to do a second contract afterwards.“If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over and I didn’t plan to stay longer. I’m trying to be smart about it, but my decision may be going back and spending time with my family — maybe it’s a sign,” she says.

Contact tracing in the UK largely stopped on March  as the number of cases soared and the country switched from a #contain# to #delay# strategy.SDLP MLA and Stormont health committee member Colin McGrath hailed the % success rate, but said % should be the target. He did concede that people are always going to come into contact with others whom they have no contact details for.The numbers are small there but % is good, he said. I would like to see it higher obviously, because % would be the ambition.There is going to be an opportunity where people are going to be in contact with people whom they maybe don#t know or don#t have contact details for.Mr McGrath added he hoped those in the CTS will continue the good work. I would have hoped that there is some expertise amongst the people who are recruited for that process of contact tracing, he added. I know in the first instances they were looking at people who were, for example, environmental health officers and people from specialist backgrounds.I would hope that they don#t leave any stone unturned in trying to get contact details, butany of us were to sit down and do an audit of whom we#ve been in contact with in the last number of days, we#re probably going to be able to list people but not list their contact details.The PHA urged anyone who develops Covid- symptoms to self-isolate and book a test.If the result is positive, we encourage you to work with the Contact Tracing Service to identy close contacts so we can follow up with them, it added. If you are contacted by the Contact Tracing Service, we urge you to follow the advice you are given.

Now, though, the towers begin to disappear in the blink of an eye. The coastal mist thickens and in the space of just a few minutes the castle disappears completely.That#s what the conditions along this wonderfully wild stretch of coastline can do, and why those who know the area and the dangers that walk side by side with the stunning scenery always urge caution.Dunluce Castle has stood in one form or another since the th century, a sentry on the clf edge gazing out across the ocean, but it could hardly have witnessed such tragedy over the centuries as on Tuesday evening.Four friends from Belfast, taking advantage of the fine weather. Three made it home, one body recovered from the sea below, a place known locally as The Lord#s Prayer.Today, the pathway leading down to the castle ruins remains closed, as do all our tourism attractions thanks to Covid- precautions.But the temptation of sunny weather still draws. And while the waters below might look calm and serene on a fine June day, what lurks beneath the surface, even the rocks themselves, hold dangers for even the best prepared. An unforgiving landscape.But it#s a landscape that lends itself perfectly to the popular activity of coasteering, where groups make their way along the shoreline by swimming, climbing and jumping from rocks.One wrong move can spell disaster.Coastguard Alistair Simpson said one of the group was unconscious in the water and was taken to White Rocks beach where he was pronounced dead. It#s understood the teenager who died hit his head on a rock.Coasteering around this coastline is a very popular pastime, but we would really encourage people to take part in an organised coasteering group, he said.There are groups here who organise it on a professional basis, they are properly equipped and carry our suitable risk assessments.We would always encourage anyone doing coasteering to wear suitable protective equipment - bare minimum a wetsuit, lejacket and helmet.Colleague Judith McNeice warned that even in the best of weather, the conditions can be treacherous.Although this was an absolutely beautul day, the north coast is notorious for having a large swell, even in the most benign weather, so there is a risk, even on a lovely day, for people going swimming or jumping off rocks, she said.Driving away from the sombre scene, car headlights remain useless as they only illuminate the fog. By the time you reach Ballintoy the sun is streaming through the windows, the temperature hits  degrees and it#s a beautul summer day again.That#s how quickly conditions can change and how suddenly lives can be put at risk.Belfast Most ReadCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus updates: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recorded in NIPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening datesNorthern Ireland public became more polarised in the run-up to Brexit: research,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But with furloughed workers in such huge numbers, even, of the , didn’t have a job to go back to, a lot of lives will be blighted.In the space of a week, Bombardier and Thompson Aero announced , job losses earlier this month.While it’s already dficult to get our heads around the impact of Covid- on our jobs market so far, we must brace ourselves for worse to come.Belfast Most ReadCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus updates: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recorded in NIPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening datesNorthern Ireland public became more polarised in the run-up to Brexit: research,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Obviously many people will be nervous, butyou can spend, do - it might save a job or two. Most of Northern Ireland#s often-criticised large public sector still have employment, as do others in IT, agriculture, etc, he said.So the advice is not to be reckless, but economies only grow and jobs are saved by spending. Soyou can, do. Maybe then we can keep less people on furlough from ending up unemployed.Speaking at an online seminar of the Association of Chartered Certied Accountants, Mr Gibson said: It will be our responsibility as citizens and as businesses to show confidence in the sectors of our economy that need it most. This will require a collective effort to go out for a meal, to buy a coffee from our local cafe and to go to the cinema when they open.He told the Belfastthat the public understandably felt powerless in the face of large-scale redundancies, including , jobs lost between aeroplane seat maker Thompson Aero and aerospace giant Bombardier. But he added: We can#t go out and buy aeroplane seats or wings, but what we can do is make those little decisions to support those restaurants, shops and cafes that might close without our support.The money you hand over to that person on the other side of the till could make the dference to whether or not that person still has that job in the future.He added putting up with queues in order to support businesses was the right thing to do. Maybe you look at the coffee shop or ice-cream shop and think you can#t be bothered queuing, he said. But that decision could be a dference between that coffee shop staying open or not.

Ireland’s two-year term will begin in January next year.Speaking after the vote, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “I believe it was a vote for the values that Ireland represents on the world stage – multilateralism, freedom, human rights, and the basic concept that countries in the world should work together to build a more peaceful, prosperous and stable world order.“Ourto the UN Security Council is a recognition of our work on the world stage over many decades, and we will use our presence to advance the causes we’ve championed – peace and security, conflict resolution and reconciliation, climate action, sustainable development and gender equality.“Recent events show us, more so than ever, that global challenges can only be overcome when the international community stands in solidarity and works together through the UN system.”The Irish Government has spent more than , euro on its campaign for the seat over the last two years and has spent that time lobbying other countries.Our belief in multilateralism is a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy.Simon CoveneyCultural events involving U and Riverdance have formed part of the campaign, while President of Ireland Michael D Higgins and Mr Varadkar met with foreign dignitaries.Voting took place in a socially distanced manner in New York, with ambassadors given time slots to cast their ballot.Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said: “Why does it matter that our small country sits on the UN Security Council “I’ve heard the criticism. The problems are too big and big states won’t listen. To those people, I point out that in the last six months the world has been threatened by a virus that knows no nationality, no borders and respects no superpower.“Countries are fighting back but we don’t yet have a medicine. The only thing we have is shared knowledge. We have knowledge on how to slow the spread and how to prevent infection.“No one country on earth will stop coronavirus, just like no one country on earth will counter climate change or hunger or Aids or poverty or gender inequality, or deliver peace in conflict zones.“Our belief in multilateralism is a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy. The voice of small countries also provides global solutions.”Mr Higgins said the election of Ireland to the Security Council is a cause for celebration.“The work of a dedicated team has been recognised, and I congratulate them on having brought what was a principled campaign, in a competitive environment, to both fruition and success,” Mr Higgins said.“The support Ireland has received vindicates the decision to run a campaign that did not avoid the issues that are urgent a campaign that engaged with global issues, such as peace-building and peacekeeping, the elimination of global poverty, the strengthening of multilateralism, and reform of the United Nations.”Irish officials told the PA news agency they are breathing a sigh of relief following the vote.They said: “Ahead of the vote we thought our chances were  .“Officials couldn’t get a lay of the land as to where the vote would go. Usually we would all see what is going on but campaigning has been going on the phone or over Zoom calls, it was hard to draw people out.“Norway had spent around  million euros on their bid, they are already a Nato member and had obvious credentials when it came to security matters.“Canada has retreated from the global stage somewhat in recent years but since Trudeau became leader, he has really pushed for them to get back elected to the Security Council.“Unlike Ireland it has the added advantage of being an English and French speaking country and can link to some countries in Africa.”Officials say Ireland’s history helped it in the campaign. “We have a history of empathy… we have our history which featured famine, sectarian conflict, civil war – this is what emerging countries will be coming to terms with after Covid-.”One diplomat said the endorsement of the campaign form Bono helped but it was one strand of Ireland’s overall campaign.“Bono is a household name and a great communicator and needs no introduction on the global stage. It won’t be a case of saying one inidual was responsiblewe win… the work on this across all streams has been ongoing for years.”PAMost ReadCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus updates: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recorded in NIPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening datesNorthern Ireland public became more polarised in the run-up to Brexit: research,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the beginning of this year the Derry News revealed that the Trust had implemented a three-year ‘financial recovery plan’ to address a poundm deficit. Finance Director Neil Guckian said the Western Trust was the only Trust in Northern Ireland with such measures in place. By February of this year the overall deficit had been reduced to around poundm. Of that total, poundm is a direct consequence of cuts over the past six years and the remaining ten is due to investment in additional staff because of safety concerns or service growth, and the extra cost of delivering existing services such as locums. googletag.cmd.push A poundm financial and efficiency recovery plan had been agreed for   which would leave around poundm to save in the final year,  . Cost saving areas identied included the recruitment of locum or temporary doctors which soared to poundm in  . Speaking at a media briefing on June , Western Trust Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen said that due to the pandemic the financial recovery plan has been ‘put to one side’. “The priority has been to respond to COVID and take whatever steps we needed to take, whether that involved staffing, PPE and other aspects of services. “So essentially we have paused our recovery programme because of the COVID pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “That doesn’t mean that we are less attentive to running the business, we run the business of our organisation as efficiently and effectively as we can. “But the actual detail of the recovery plan has been set to one side during this period.” The cost of running health services during the pandemic has risen dramatically with the rise in PPE usage and need for enhanced cleaning schedules in all health and social care settings. In April, Mr Guckian said the Trust would normally use , fluid resistant surgical masks per day. That increased to , a day at the beginning of the pandemic, then , and at the height of the pandemic to ,-, masks in a single week.

At a meeting of the Western Trust Board on June , Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen provided a snapshot of community services by reading out an email from a community team leader based at Great James Street. In it the worker said: “All the publicity has been about the efforts within the hospital, and quite rightly too, but the hospital didn’t get the expected the surge from COVID-. “However, the volume of work in both our services in the community has been huge and much more intense than usual. googletag.cmd.push “I know the health visiting team are exhausted, this rate of work can’t be maintained, and we’re not going to get any relief as our services are stepping up now again.” The worker explained that staff had pulled together as a team and embraced new ways of working, at one stage managing a % reduction in staff numbers. She said: “This crisis has expedited the process of our team getting smart phones and from the feedback it has made a huge dference in being able to interact with families, especially safeguarding families. In such a short space of time. “Parents are able to send video clips to health visitors, for example to diagnose oral thrush or see the walking gait of a child. googletag.cmd.push “We set up a parents health line and looking at other ways to improve contact with families, a dedicated Facebook page in conjunction with Trust communication’s team but controlled by the health visitor team. “Parents have been emailing parents the information they require. “Our health visiting team has been working extremely hard although home visiting was reduced. Health visitors were ringing families at home with each call lasting about  to  minutes longer than a home visit might have taken.” Health visitors were contacting more families with a total of , calls for home visits completed in April for the Derry, Limavady and Strabane areas. Dr Kilgallen continued reading the email: “They start making them before am and are working consistently throughout the day, one after another which is much more intense. “They also have the worry that many of the safeguarding families are not being seen, they are being tele-linked and that’s harder and very tiring. “We had health visitor redeployed into the hospital therefore leaving vacant caseloads but those on the ground are working to cover those vacant caseloads so there isn’t a backlog.” The team leader went on to speak about the community midwery services who experienced a high volume of work with an increase in the number of antenatal bookings. They anticipate that come November-December onwards there will be a signicant workload due to lockdown. The meeting was told that , people have received help and support from community based teams, including those iniduals who were shielding. That included delivering food parcels and prescriptions, and regular telephone contact. Dr Kilgallen said she brought this feedback to board members so that they can all recognise the ‘very dedicated work’ of this team.

At a Stormont sitting this afternoon questions were put to the First Minister including one from Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan about the Magee project. Arlene Foster said The Executive Officehas reaffirmed the commitment set out in the New Decade New Approach document to establish a graduate entry medical school in Derry. Its objective now is to progress the project to secure a ‘sustainable outcome on the fastest feasible timetable’. “This is a complex project involving a number of departments and external agencies,” the First Minister said, “and TEO is currently working with the departments of health, economy and finance to prepare further advice to the Executive on the issues which need to be addressed to secure that sustainability.” googletag.cmd.push On May  Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that TEO would assume responsibility for the medical school project and on May  that it had been approved. Mark H Durkan askeda ‘cast iron guarantee’ could be given that it will be ready to accept admissions in September  and,so, what specic dates and deadlines must be met. He was told the Executive received an update from the head of the civil service yesterday. The strategic investment board are involved to ensure that any ‘risks are minimised’ around the delivery of this project, she continued. The First Minister stated: “We do not intend to make any announcement about the date of first intake until all the necessary preparation work has been completed and we very much hope that will continue at pace in TEO. googletag.cmd.push “Because as I said this is a cross-departmental issue which is why TEO stepped in to try and assist to make sure that things move smoothly.” FINANCIAL CHALLENGES UUP leader Steve Aiken said one of the key strategic partners for Magee is Ulster University and UU has been involved in ‘very signicant cost over-runs’ at its Belfast campus. “I think there are some investigations ongoing as to whether UU are actually capable of managing projects. “Therefore, can I ask the minister what confidence she has that UU are actually a suitable partner for delivering this vital project for Londonderry.” Arlene Foster responded: “Capacity and finance are clearly issues that will have to be examined as a wider look at risk management in relation to this scheme and that’s why the head of the civil service was able to give us an update yesterday.” Independent East Derry MLA Claire Sugden said she understands there has been ‘considerable capital monies committed to the Magee project’. But she queried whether the department for the economy required additional finances to resource the running and day to day costs ‘or is that something they’ll have to find within their own budget’. DUP leader Mrs Foster said the ‘financial and governance challenges’ currently facing UU will be overseen by the strategic investment board. It’s important to have that body ‘looking in at what we’re trying to achieve’ she said, ‘to give us the confidence that any risks that are identied can be managed and mitigated.’ Those matters will be taken forward but with oversight from TEO. ‘ECONOMIC DAMAGE’ The Derry News has also learned of a letter circulated to UU staff this afternoon. Professor Paul Bartholomew, Interim Vice-Chancellor at Ulster University informed colleagues about the ‘financial sustainability’ of the institution. In the correspondence he cites a dferent Higher Education funding model in NI and the Coronavirus pandemic as major obstacles. He says ‘the immediate economic damage is now becoming clear’ and ‘we need to consider the implications for us within the context of our already stretched financial position.’ “In that context, and as you would expect, we continue to closely monitor the financial trends and outlook to build a sustainable financial strategy that must address not only the financial impacts of COVID, but also the pre-existing challenge of a cost base that has grown, whilst income from government block grant and fees from capped student numbers have remained largely flat.” He makes it clear that its financial strategy is likely to necessitate staff cuts. Prof Bartholomew said: “That sustainable financial strategy has identied a number of options that may, in the near future, be put forward for decision. Representing nearly % of our total cost base, those options necessarily include staff cost reduction measures. “A full strategic review is also proposed to enable clarity around strategic priorities and associated resource allocation we understand that across the institution staff are already operating at full stretch and any decision made to achieve sustainability must, in parallel, address issues of workload and prioritisation.” He adds: “With the full support of SLT and Council, we have been engaging with the Department for the Economy and our own Trade Union colleagues, to ensure there is a full understanding of the position, this has been in advance of considering formally any possible options that offer the best solutions for staff.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.

The average value of a claim is pound, googletag.cmd.push Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. googletag.cmd.push “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”  CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

North West Regional College lecturers will host a series of online events, ranging from swing dance style combinations, health and sport activities to include tips for a healthy lestyle, first aid and holistic health, as well as online cooking demos.

Looking at the wonderful and wide-ranging programme that has been put in place for this festival is extremely exciting – there really is something for everyone and I think it has been adapted really well to fit in with the current climate in taking the festival online. We can all do with learning new things, whether its a new skill or education on really important issues like disability awareness or the role medicine plays in our society. This programme celebrates everyone, from our young children to our students, and the adults out there as well – its never too late to learn! Our current situation can be overwhelming and frustrating at times, and this festival offers the perfect solution, by picking up new skills and information, and by utilising technology in a way that we may never have needed before.” More details about the festival are available on the councils website.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

Crops lay flat in the fields from the constant pounding of the rain. As a family of farmers it was an extremely dficult time.ldquoIn between the deluges we managed to scramble our way to the first Irish Senior Cup final and emerged victorious mdash a rare moment of sunshine that year.For Paul, then a teenager still at school, the memories of  years ago are still vivid.ldquoIt was my first year in the st XI, playing alongside my father and Alfie. They were  and  years young at that time and still playing well.ldquoIn fact, the following year, in the same competition, I sat in amazement watching Alfie blast a ton against a Bangor with John Elder leading the attack, having opened the bowling for Ireland against Australia earlier that summer in front of , people at Downpatrick.ldquoAnyway, Alfie smashed nine huge sixes, all clearing the Strangford Road end. This was at a spritely age of .ldquoAll of a sudden I realised the legendary tales of Alfiersquos big hitting were true. Dad always said he hit the ball much further than anyone . That innings remains the most memorable I have seen from a Downpatrick player. saw the ICU as it was then bring in bowl-outs to decide washed-out contests, with all  players trying to hit the stumps in a shoot-out.In the first round Downpatrick faced Leinster and of the  players who aimed, only one was successful mdash the aforementioned Alfie.Downpatrick had reached the final after a famous win in the lionrsquos den of Donemana, with Brian Ferris and Jim Patterson smashing unbeaten fties in an emphatic victory.ldquoThere was a lot of publicity surrounding the Irish Senior Cup which at that time was sponsored by Schweppes, said Paul.ldquoIn the years that followed, just like the inter-pros played for the Guinness Cup, everyone simply called the competition lsquoThe Schweppesrsquo. In more recent times, the Ulster Cup was known as lsquoThe Clubturfrsquo.ldquoBefore the final, BBC TV sent a crew down to interview some of us, and ironically record us bowling at the stumps. It was still raining. It took us ages to hit the stumpshellipI got abuse at school.ldquoNeedless to say, the final was washed out without a bowl bowled and the miserable summer continued. It was desperately disappointing after a week of huge anticipation.The toss for the venue of the replay was conducted over the phone between the two captains, Ian Shields and Derek McCann.Downpatrick won and the replay was scheduled for midweek, Wednesday, September , and North Downrsquos Robin Haire recalls the conditions werenrsquot really fit for cricket.ldquoDownpatrick had actual puddles of water on parts of outfield, he recalled. ldquoMy abiding memory of that final was the spray of the water when you hit it along the ground.ldquoIt was totally unplayable, but the authorities wanted it played and out of the way. Nowadays umpires would have said try tomorrow.The decider itself proved to be a turgid, low-key affair, with little atmosphere and a contest which matched the gloomy conditions.ldquoIt just felt like a midweek league game, said Paul Linehan. ldquoPeople were at work, there was no crowd to speak of, it was cold and it wasnrsquot much of a game.ldquoNorth Down batted first, we bowled and fielded brilliantly, and they scraped to just . Karl Quinn and man of the match Philip Lennon each took three wickets, Jim Patterson got two, while Brian Hodges and Brian Ferris got one apiece.ldquoWe opened with Keith Malone and Derek McCann and I was due to come in three. I was a very nervous  year-old when I arrived at the wicket after they had put on . Keith was going well and I just needed to stay in.ldquoAnyway, desperate to get off the mark, I predicted Robin Haire was going to bowl me a long hop. I was right back on the stumps, ready to smash it, when he fired in a quicker ball which crashed into my ankles in front of middle. Out for a duck in the All-Ireland Cup final. I was beyond devastated as cricket was everything to me.ldquoWe eventually won by six wickets as our experienced side adopted a safety-first attitude, taking no risks. Derek McCann lted the famous trophy and Downpatrick were All-Ireland champions.There were to be no champagne celebrations for the teenager though.ldquoUnfortunately, I was too young to down a couple of beers, so it was straight back home after the final for Dad and I, two All-Ireland champions.Six years later, Downpatrick would secure the trophy for the second time in one of the most thrilling encounters ever, overcoming North by three runs.There was to be no personal glory though for Paul Linehan as he missed out on the chance of redemption.ldquoThe disappointment of making a duck remains as I was never to play in another All-Ireland final, having been injured for the  victory, he said.ldquoHowever, all these years later, my  medal is still very much a prized possession..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C June 10%2C 2000  ","story":"TYRELLA mdash Tyrella beach has retained a prestigious European award which recognises the quality of the local tourist facility.The beach is one of eight in the province to receive the highly sought after Blue Flag Award, the highest possible recognition for cleanliness.Down Council chiefs are delighted Tyrella has once again been recognised for its quality, and the amount of effort they put into maintaining it, in the annual Tidy Britain Group awards.The awards were officially handed over on Monday along with the prestigious Blue Flag which will continue to fly high over Tyrella for the next  months.The beach was rigorously examined in an unannounced inspection by a  of European experts who focused their attention on cleanliness and the environmental management of Tyrella.Council official Leonard Lawson said everyone was delighted their efforts have again been recognised.ldquoThe award also recognises the councilrsquos effort to manage the beach, provide information points, educational material and detailed displays in the beach centre, he said.ldquoThe water quality is also critical to ensure Blue Flag status is retailed and the council aims to continue to work hard to maintain its high standards.NEWCASTLE mdash Armed robbers made off with over pound, in cash yesterday morning after a hold-up at a Newcastle bank.The three masked men burst into the Northern Bank in Main Street at .am and order everyone inside to co-operate.

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high demand.Local SDLP MLA Colin McGrath also welcomed the plannersrsquo approval.He said: ldquoThe housing development at the old Downe site has been a protracted and drawn out process.ldquoHaving been in

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since . Picture: Michael CooperSince the beginning of lockdown, the company has seen a signicant rise in the amount of water used in homes.This rise, coupled with the dry weather, has contributed to a drop in water levels in reservoirs.Increased household use has not been offset by the closure of businesses, as many high water users, such as the agri-food sector, factories etc. have been able to stay operational during this time. NI Water Chief Executive Sara Venning said: “This recent dry spell, which has been breaking records, coupled with more people at home using more water, has resulted in a signicant drop in our water levels.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

He suggested that in these exceptional circumstances quick decisions are essential to suit local issues.“This is highlighted by the recent decision by the Minister for Infrastructure to ask councils to relax the rules for on-street cafes and bars and also the Department’s investigation into potential widening of pavements to help with social distancing.”“The decision to provide more flexibility on pavement use is welcomed, subject to ensuring disabled access is maintained, and greater pedestrianisation is something that is increasingly seen as a way to help revitalise our towns. But without visibility of these decisions or the processes, timescales and likelihood of funding it is extremely dficult to plan.”“I believe that strategic planning of transport, funding decisions and the development of our townscapes will have a huge bearing on the success of our economic recovery. For example, I believe that a new railway station and park and ride facility in the Rushmere area of Craigavon could create an economic development and sustainable transport hub which would benefit the wider area, including those travelling from Armagh.”“Connectivity is key and enhanced transport links with Belfast and Dublin, the strategic development of the A corridor in Banbridge, and sustainable linkages to build our tourism sector could create new jobs and opportunities. Successfully connecting people and places.”“However, the correct powers and funding decisions are needed to deliver any strategic plan and vision.”“A closer partnership arrangement between councils and the Executive Departments would be a good start. But in these unprecedented times, where pressure is building on businesses, jobs and our citizens there could well be a clamour for greater local control.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
