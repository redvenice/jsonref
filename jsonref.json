In 2015, she reportedly told the journalist Piers Morgan that she had not always sought showbusiness success.‘As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you,’ she told him.          The actress married Prince Harry after meeting him in London in 2016. She has now become the Duchess of Sussex          Meghan Markle is expected to become a British citizen but she has harboured dreams of becoming President of the USMeghan is still a U.S. citizen because the process to become a fully-fledged Briton is expected to take three years. She is expected to retain her U.S. citizenship, as dual citizenship is permitted. Presidential candidates must be U.S. citizens.Meghan has cultivated a warm friendship with former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, while chat show host Oprah Winfrey, who is one of the most influential women in America, was given a prime seat at St George’s Chapel Windsor, opposite the Royal Family.A royal historian says Meghan would find it difficult to enter U.S. politics while still married to Harry. ‘It is a pretty strong rule that members of the Royal Family keep out of politics,’ he says.Share this article    The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leaving Windsor Castle after their weddingBut Harry could, of course, give up official royal duties. His mother, Princess Diana, was said to have considered moving to America.And the claim appears to have caused consternation at Kensington Palace yesterday, with the Duchess giving her official spokesman permission to take the unusual step of issuing a public denial.‘This conversation you describe with an associate is fictitious,’ the spokesman insisted.I am, though, not the only one to hear rumours that Meghan still holds political ambitions.Former Times editor Sir Simon Jenkins says: ‘Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal.‘Such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. She might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. All I can say is, why not?’Meghan’s best friend is Jessica Mulroney, whose father-in-law, Brian, was prime minister of Canada for nine years.Meghan has strong political views and attacked Donald Trump in 2016 for being ‘isive’ and ‘misogynistic’. She might have to reach an accommodation with her new chum George Clooney, who is said to hold political ambitions of his own. Perhaps he could be her running mate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/01/4C898F2700000578-5759713-Auctioning_under_the_name_ClaireOliver87_the_listing_included_th-a-28_1527035182950.jpg","title":"Official royal wedding gift bag sells 21 400 eBay","story":"    Included in the listing was a bottle of Windsor Castle spring water, a fridge magnet, an over-sized chocolate coin, a tin of shortbread biscuits, a spectator badge, a spectator wristband, a parking sticker, the order of service, a postcard, a map and day briefing, entry card letter and finally the tote bag itself          Auctioning under the name ClaireOliver87, the listing included the entire contents of the gift bag as well as the paperwork received on and prior to the dayThe guests arrived at 9am to see 600 VIPs including the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles as well as the Clooneys, the Beckhams, Elton John and Oprah Winfrey turn up for the A-list wedding of the decade. And as 120,000 well-wishers fought for space outside the castle these privileged 1,200 were able to get great views of the newlyweds as they kissed outside the chapel and paraded past in the royal Ascot Landau carriage. But within hours of the event finishing dozens of their free hessian gift bags were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.Many of the sellers had clearly planned to do it in advance because they photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel to ensure they looked genuine on eBay.           Bids for items have now reached more than £1,000 even though they were handed out for free by Meghan and Harry  Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Guests arriving in the grounds of Windsor Castle passed tables where bags were handed out to each guest but some have taken advantage of this generosity          The canvas bags had the happy couple\u0027s initials on the side and are being sold on the promise buyers will be getting a piece of royal wedding historySo why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

The plant is pictured above on Tuesday           Ten well were \u0027quenched\u0027 with water which countered the pressure of the volcanic steam below, to prevent the emission of toxic gases. An eleventh well was plugged with mud because water wouldn\u0027t cool it down. The plan on Tuesday           Lava has already crossed onto the plant\u0027s land and destroyed one building, was still about 1,000 feet from the wells on Tuesday\u0027All wells are stable at this point,\u0027 said Ige. County officials are also monitoring various gases that may leak into the atmosphere.A spike in gas levels could prompt a mass evacuation, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno. Officials, however, have not discussed specific scenarios that would lead to such an emergency.Puna Geothermal, owned by Nevada\u0027s Ormat Technologies, was shut down shortly after Kilauea began spewing lava on May 3. The plant harnesses heat and steam from the earth\u0027s core to spin turbines to generate power. A flammable gas called pentane is used as part of the process, though officials earlier this month removed 50,000 gallons of it from the plant to reduce the chance of explosions.The plant has capacity to produce 38 megawatts of electricity, providing roughly one-quarter of the Big Island\u0027s daily energy demand.Lava destroyed a building near the plant late Monday, bringing the total number of structures overtaken in the past several weeks to nearly 50, including dozens of homes. The latest was a warehouse adjacent to the Puna plant, Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The building was owned by the state and was used in geothermal research projects in the early days of the site.           County officials say they are closely monitoring emissions, and will issue an evacuation if toxic fumes spike.

The plant pictured above on Monday             The Nevada-owned plant provides about a quarter of the Big Island\u0027s power. the plane is pictured above on May 16 Native Hawaiians have long expressed frustration with the plant since it came online in 1989 they say it is built on sacred land. Goddess of fire, Pele, is believed to live on Kilauea volcano, and the plant itself is thought to desecrate her name.Other residents have voiced concerns over health and safety.Scientists, however, say the conditions on Kilauea make it a good site for harnessing the earth for renewable energy.\u0027There\u0027s heat beneath the ground if you dig deep enough everywhere,\u0027 said Laura Wisland, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. But in some places in the U.S. \u0027it\u0027s just hotter, and you can access the geothermal energy more easily.\u0027          Lava flows have already reached the ocean. When lava hits the cold ocean water, it creates a steam called laze which is toxic. Hawaiian and mariners are being warned to avoid this toxic steam.

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed today.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerSnake found battling giant centipede in VietnamHorrific moment Chinese boy is mauled by pit bull outside pet shopGolfer Aaron Wise gets rejected for a kiss after PGA win\u0027You hate Scottish people!\u0027: Alexa device unable to understand womanPrince Harry gives emotional speech for Prince Charles birthdayMeghan puts protective arm around Harry on newlyweds\u0027 first eventHidden camera shows workers violently kicking pigs at farmPrince Harry and Meghan attend Prince Charles\u0027 birthday partyBodycam reveals that activist LIED about being raped by a copShocking CCTV shows burglars trying to kick down front doorPrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up.

Photographer Kevin Ebi said: \u0027I panned my camera with it to capture the action. Then behind me, I heard the cry of a bald eagle. I turned around and saw it approaching fast\u0027          The fox, with its jaw still clenched on the rabbit, inadvertently got snagged by the bald eagle. The bird lifted the young fox and rabbit into the sky triggering an even more dramatic struggle          The fox was being swung to and fro, 20 feet high about ground, but stubbornly hung on to its prey at the park          Hanging on by its teeth: Mr Ebi said the scene \u0027was even more dramatic than I expected.

They can comfortably lift about half their body weight — so about five or six pound,\u0027 said Mr Ebi          The fox finally gives up. The mid-air tussle had ended within just eight seconds, according to the photographer\u0027I spent the day watching several young foxes, called kits, rest and play on the prairie. I counted at least eight kits. There are probably more. Shortly before sunset, they started hunting. One fox managed to snag a rabbit’s foot. Several kits gave chase, but it made it to its den to feed.\u0027About 15 minutes later, a red fox caught a rabbit and was carrying it across the meadow. I panned my camera with it to capture the action. Then behind me, I heard the cry of a bald eagle. I turned around and saw it approaching fast. I knew it wanted the rabbit. I intently trained my camera on the fox bracing for a split second of action.\u0027Mr Ebi said the scene \u0027was even more dramatic than I expected. I thought the fox would drop the rabbit, giving the eagle an easy dinner.\u0027To my surprise,Instead, the fox, with its jaw still clenched on the rabbit, inadvertently got snagged by the bald eagle.

The eagle transferred the rabbit to its right talon and eventually let the fox go. The fox fell from enough height to trigger a small dust cloud when it hit the ground.\u0027The whole battle was over in less than eight seconds.\u0027He said there is no question that bald eagles are skilled hunters, as the birds of prey can spot a fish from a mile away and fly to it in under a minute.\u0027But they’re also masters of something scientists call kleptoparasitism: the art of stealing food from others,\u0027 Mr Ebi added.  \u0027There have been stories of bald eagles taking off with animals as large as young deer, but while they’re strong, they’re not that strong. They can comfortably lift about half their body weight — so about five or six pounds. The young fox and rabbit were likely just beyond that weight.\u0027Interestingly, rabbits aren’t the foxes\u0027 first choice for supper: \u0027They actually prefer insects, berries and voles. But the berries and voles have been displaced by the rabbits, which have clear-cut the prairie with their vast burrows.\u0027 The photographer added: \u0027Don’t worry: the fox was fine. It shook off the encounter and resumed playing with its fellow kits.

It\u0027s a monolithic insulation, made by an industrial process and surrounds the whole container inside without any heat bridges.\u0027According to Mallinowski, using the specialty foam insulation not only makes the containers more efficient, it also allows for 10-centimetre thick walls, meaning that designers can make the most out of the containers\u0027 already limited space.He said: \u0027We can build very thin walls so that the space in the container is as big as possible.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/13/4C89CFF200000578-0-image-a-3_1527079267353.jpg","title":"Mugabe no Zimbabwe parliament hearing","story":"Former Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, above, was summoned to give evidence about diamond corruption, which is alleged to have cost billions of dollars during his ruleHe said the Monday session had been set for 2pm, although no-one in Mugabe\u0027s office would say whether or not he would attend.Lawmakers want to question him over his 2016 claim that Zimbabwe lost $15 billion in revenue due to corruption and foreign exploitation in the diamond sector.\u0027We are not here to humiliate him, we expect him to have enough time to prepare.

However, players will be allowed to stay in the locker rooms The NFL has announced a new national anthem policy that requires all team personnel on the field to stand during The Star-Spangled Banner while allowing players the choice to remain in the locker room.\u0027This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,\u0027 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \u0027Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.\u0027 Beginning in 2009, the NFL required that all players be on the field during the national anthem.Under the new rules, teams will be fined for any personnel on the field that fails to show what the league determines to be appropriate respect for the anthem. The teams are then free to fine their own personnel, including players, for protesting during the anthem. So while some teams could have a policy requiring everyone on the field to stand, other franchises could choose to pay the league fines while allowing its players to demonstrate during The Star-Spangled Banner. The decision would put inidual teams at the forefront of the ongoing controversy surrounding the peaceful demonstrations, which  are aimed at raising awareness about inequality and police brutality against minorities.            The controversial issue exploded two years ago after then-San Francisco 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick (center) refused to stand to protest inequality and police brutality          Currently, NFL regulations say that players \u0027should\u0027 stand for The Star-Spangled Banner\u0027It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic,\u0027 Goodell said. \u0027This is not and was never the case.\u0027 Initially, the NFL Players Association did not seem receptive to the policy changes. \u0027Maybe this new rule proposal that is being voted on is a compromise between the NFL office and club CEOs on various sides of the issue, but certainly not with player leadership,\u0027 wrote NFLPA spokesman George Atallah. \u0027We weren\u0027t there or part of the discussions.\u0027NFL is \u0027considering 15-yard penalties for teams who kneel...I\u0027ll pay the fine! Jets chairman says he WON\u0027T penalize...Share this articleThe NFLPA released an official statement Wednesday afternoon. \u0027The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this new policy,\u0027 read the statement. \u0027NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.\u0027The vote by NFL club CEOs today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the NFL’s Management Council John Mara about the principles, values and patriotism of our League.\u0027Our union will review the new policy and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement.\u0027According to an ESPN report, the idea had the support of \u0027at least 24 owners.\u0027 One objector, New York Jets chairman Christopher Johnson, told Newsday that he would pay the league\u0027s fine, but not fine any of his players that choose to protest during the anthem.          Prior to a game in September, the Dallas Cowboys took a knee before rising as a team to stand for the national anthem. Since then, owner Jerry Jones has vocally opposed the protests          Both Eric Reid (right) and Colin Kaepernick (center) have sued the NFL owners for collusion, accusing the league of retaliating against them for their peaceful demonstrations Kaepernick has not played since 2016 and filed a collusion case against NFL owners alleging a concerted effort was made to keep him out of football. Former teammate Eric Reid, a safety with the 49ers and unrestricted free agent, is following suit.Reid, who joined Kaepernick in kneeling to bring attention to social injustice, visited only one team - the Cincinnati Bengals - and was asked if he would continue to kneel during the anthem by team ownership.Kaepernick had a visit scheduled with the Seattle Seahawks - the only team to host Kaepernick in 2017 - but it was postponed because management wanted greater clarity on Kaepernick\u0027s intentions during pregame.NFL games remain among the most watched programming on television, but ratings took another significant dip during the 2017 regular season amidst the controversial protests.The average audience was 14.9 million viewers per game, down 9.7 percent from 16.5 million viewers in the 2016 regular season, according to Nielsen. The 2016 viewership was down eight percent from the previous year.          President Donald Trump congratulated NASCAR on its attitude toward the anthem However, NBC\u0027s Sunday Night Football remained the season\u0027s ratings king for the seventh straight year, according to Nielsen. That beats the previous record set by Fox\u0027s \u0027American Idol\u0027 between 2005-06 and 2010-11.  The Sunday Night football games averaged 18.2 million TV viewers in 2017, a 29 percent margin over the runner-up: CBS\u0027s \u0027Thursday Night Football\u0027 On Monday, when welcoming stock car driver Martin Truex Jr. and his team to the White House, Trump again raised the topic of anthem protests. \u0027One thing I love about NASCAR is they do indeed stand for the playing of the National Anthem. They do indeed,\u0027 Trump said.\u0027Somebody said maybe you shouldn\u0027t say that, it\u0027ll be controversial and I said that\u0027s okay, NASCAR\u0027s not going to mind it at all. Right fellas? They don\u0027t mind it at all,\u0027 Trump added.Despite the President\u0027s enthusiasm for NASCAR and its attitude towards the national anthem, the sport\u0027s ratings have plummeted around 28 percent over the last two years, according to Forbes.           NFL commissioner Roger Goodell believes the league\u0027s new policy will put the focus back on the game and alleviate the controversy over the player protests The policy adopted today was approved in concert with the NFL\u0027s ongoing commitment to local communities and our country - one that is extraordinary in its scope, resources, and alignment with our players. We are dedicated to continuing our collaboration with players to advance the goals of justice and fairness in all corners of our society.The efforts by many of our players sparked awareness and action around issues of social justice that must be addressed. The platform that we have created together is certainly unique in professional sports and quite likely in American business. We are honored to work with our players to drive progress.It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This is not and was never the case.This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem. Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.We believe today\u0027s decision will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it - and on our fans who enjoy it.POLICY STATEMENTThe 32 member clubs of the National Football League have reaffirmed their strong commitment to work alongside our players to strengthen our communities and advance social justice. The unique platform that we have created is unprecedented in its scope, and will provide extraordinary resources in support of programs to promote positive social change in our communities.The membership also strongly believes that:All team and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.The Game Operations Manual will be revised to remove the requirement that all players be on the field for the Anthem.Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room or in a similar location off the field until after the Anthem has been performed.A club will be fined by the League if its personnel are on the field and do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.Each club may develop its own work rules, consistent with the above principles, regarding its personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.The Commissioner will impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.        (source: NFL.com)                                                     NFL owners expected to approve new national anthem policyDetroit Lions president Rod Wood: NFL must get anthem issue \u0027resolved\u0027Roger Goodell\u0027s statement on national anthem policy - NFL.comJets chairman Christopher Johnson says he’ll pay anthem-related league fines for his players | Newsday"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/20/4C90D0EE00000578-5763941-image-a-25_1527104233589.jpg","title":"Explosions rock tiny Spanish town sending giant smoke plume air blast","story":"    A plume of smoke could be seen for miles above ParamosA woman has died and at least 26 people have been injured in an explosion at an illegal fireworks depot in Spain. Explosions  rocked the small town of Paramos where ten houses have been destroyed shooting a giant plume of smoke into the air on Wednesday.Seven children are among the casualties after the blasts at around 4.25pm. A house, being used to store fireworks, was destroyed, as well as neighbouring homes in the town around three miles from  Baldrans.Conflicting reports are still emerging from the area where a further three fatalities are yet to be confirmed.Earlier reports four people may have beenkilled appeared to be ruled out by officials but Spanish media reports have said otherwise. The regional Xunta de Galicia government confirmed last night police were looking for more people among the rubble of houses that had been destroyed.           Fire crews have been attempting to secure the area of an illegal fireworks blast which destroyed ten homes          At least ten homes were destroyed in the explosion in Paramos, Spain, late on Wednesday after reports fireworks caused huge explosions when they were transported to a home          Investigators are on scene where one woman was killed and 26 were injured, including seveen children on WedesdayAlberto Nunez Feijoo said: \u0027The great uncertainty at the moment is whether there are more victims.\u0027The owner of the fireworks company has been arrested and taken into police custody. His \u0027illegal\u0027 factory had been closed by a court order and the Spaniard had reportedly ordered the moving of stock from the warehouse to a private home when the blast went off.Alfonso Rueda, vice-president of the regional Xunta de Galicia government, said no-one was missing and said none of those hurt had suffered life-threatening injuries.Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy, a native Galician who grew up in the province of Pontevedra where the explosion took place, said his government was ready to offer any help the regional government needed.           Officials have confirmed there are no missing people.

The plant is pictured above on Tuesday           Ten well were \u0027quenched\u0027 with water which countered the pressure of the volcanic steam below, to prevent the emission of toxic gases. An eleventh well was plugged with mud because water wouldn\u0027t cool it down.

County officials are also monitoring various gases that may leak into the atmosphere.A spike in gas levels could prompt a mass evacuation, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno. Officials, however, have not discussed specific scenarios that would lead to such an emergency.Puna Geothermal, owned by Nevada\u0027s Ormat Technologies, was shut down shortly after Kilauea began spewing lava on May 3. The plant harnesses heat and steam from the earth\u0027s core to spin turbines to generate power. A flammable gas called pentane is used as part of the process, though officials earlier this month removed 50,000 gallons of it from the plant to reduce the chance of explosions.The plant has capacity to produce 38 megawatts of electricity, providing roughly one-quarter of the Big Island\u0027s daily energy demand.Lava destroyed a building near the plant late Monday, bringing the total number of structures overtaken in the past several weeks to nearly 50, including dozens of homes. The latest was a warehouse adjacent to the Puna plant, Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The building was owned by the state and was used in geothermal research projects in the early days of the site.           County officials say they are closely monitoring emissions, and will issue an evacuation if toxic fumes spike.

Goddess of fire, Pele, is believed to live on Kilauea volcano, and the plant itself is thought to desecrate her name.Other residents have voiced concerns over health and safety.Scientists, however, say the conditions on Kilauea make it a good site for harnessing the earth for renewable energy.\u0027There\u0027s heat beneath the ground if you dig deep enough everywhere,\u0027 said Laura Wisland, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. But in some places in the U.S. \u0027it\u0027s just hotter, and you can access the geothermal energy more easily.\u0027          Lava flows have already reached the ocean. When lava hits the cold ocean water, it creates a steam called laze which is toxic. Hawaiian and mariners are being warned to avoid this toxic steam.

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed today.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerSnake found battling giant centipede in VietnamHorrific moment Chinese boy is mauled by pit bull outside pet shopGolfer Aaron Wise gets rejected for a kiss after PGA win\u0027You hate Scottish people!\u0027: Alexa device unable to understand womanPrince Harry gives emotional speech for Prince Charles birthdayMeghan puts protective arm around Harry on newlyweds\u0027 first eventHidden camera shows workers violently kicking pigs at farmPrince Harry and Meghan attend Prince Charles\u0027 birthday partyBodycam reveals that activist LIED about being raped by a copShocking CCTV shows burglars trying to kick down front doorPrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":null,"title":"Incredible moment hippos SAVE wildebeest crocodiles epic struggle South Africa","story":"    The footage shows the heroic hippos approach the struggling creature and pounce on the crocodile which forced it to release its grip on the wildebeest The footage shows the heroic hippos approach the struggling creature and pounce on the crocodile which forced it to release its grip on the wildebeest.  Taking advantage of this, the wildebeest then managed to escape after a long battle. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/09/4C8C830E00000578-5761173-image-a-2_1527064176244.jpg","title":"Boy tries blow candle birthday cake trying tuck ALIGHT","story":"    Even before the cake has been set on the table the little boy is seen huffing and puffing away energetically          Close one!

The average life of a container is thirteen-years but its journey doesn\u0027t have to end there.\u0027Instead of being turned into scrap metal, freight space can become high quality, long-lasting living space.\u0027By doing so, we wish to combat housing shortages in many areas and demonstrate that sustainability and social action does not have to be a drawback for housing association and property developers.\u0027          The quirky design has been produced by German company Containerwerk          The homes start at £35,000 but can be ordered  but can only be ordered with a contract volume of 20 containers or more          The properties have special foam insulation to compensate for the steel structure of the containers          The large master bedroom comes complete with an en-suite bathroom closed off by a curtainModules start at £35,000, depending on the version, but can only be ordered with a contract volume of 20 containers or more.Building shipping containers has been popular for years but the process of turning them into viable living structures is complicated.One of the major problems is insulating the structures but Containerwerk co-founder Ivan Mallinowski has invented an industrial system to line the structures with a layer of foam insulation.Perfect pad to kick off your blue suede shoes! An Elvis...Share this article\u0027Insulation is the big problem with building houses in containers,\u0027 Mallinowski said in a Dezeen video.\u0027If you look at the physics of a container, it is made from steel, and steel is a very good heat conductor.\u0027We build a special type of insulation. It\u0027s a monolithic insulation, made by an industrial process and surrounds the whole container inside without any heat bridges.\u0027According to Mallinowski, using the specialty foam insulation not only makes the containers more efficient, it also allows for 10-centimetre thick walls, meaning that designers can make the most out of the containers\u0027 already limited space.He said: \u0027We can build very thin walls so that the space in the container is as big as possible.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/13/4C89CFF200000578-0-image-a-3_1527079267353.jpg","title":"Mugabe no Zimbabwe parliament hearing","story":"Former Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, above, was summoned to give evidence about diamond corruption, which is alleged to have cost billions of dollars during his ruleHe said the Monday session had been set for 2pm, although no-one in Mugabe\u0027s office would say whether or not he would attend.Lawmakers want to question him over his 2016 claim that Zimbabwe lost $15 billion in revenue due to corruption and foreign exploitation in the diamond sector.\u0027We are not here to humiliate him, we expect him to have enough time to prepare.

I christened them Kesh Angels and gave them heart-shaped sunglasses’When I first met Karima, she was 14 years old and selling bracelets in Djemaa el-Fna, the bustling central square in Marrakech. She’s the girl on the very right here, leaning to the side. They’re all henna girls now, Karima and her friends, and they posed for this in 2010, in front of the Theatre Royal in Marrakech.Djemaa el-Fna, which means “internal space”, is where all the snake-charmers, storytellers and belly-dancers work, in among food stalls and other types of entertainment. The square’s been there for centuries. It’s like a vast piece of street theatre, full of people all day long – tourists and Moroccans alike, there to buy food, have henna done on their hands, or just become part of the big play. Karima and her friends understand the camera: they know how to play to an audience. They are artists. The bikes are their own: Marrakech is famously a bike city. Because of the way the Medina – the old Arab quarter – is built, it can take you 15 minutes by bike to reach the main road and the new town, but half an hour if you’re walking. So everybody goes by bike.Although I was born in Morocco, I spent part of my childhood in England, so have a different perspective on my country. I like to push buttons. Here, I wanted to play with the way a veiled woman riding a motorbike might seem jarring from a western perspective. I called them Kesh Angels, with Kesh short for Marrakech, and Angels from Hell’s Angels.It can be hard to tell, because of the way I usually set up my images, but here they’re all wearing their own clothing. The only props I gave them were some socks and the heart-shaped sunglasses, just to have a bit of fun with the cliche of the rock star, the biker in the leather jacket. I work with whatever I can find cheap in markets. I think the glasses came from Camden in London. I’m constantly collecting stuff and pulling it out at the right moment – either to use as props, or to put borders around my images. The borders are partly just a graphic pattern, but I also like mixing recognisable western brands with Arabic writing and goods. Sometimes they reference the subject of the shot: I’ll use beef stock cans, for example, when I’m shooting a beefy guy.A lot of planning goes into a shoot and I always start with a sketch. But then I go with the flow. This was an extremely lively shoot. Once I set up the scene, the women started loosening up. I have some other images of us all riding en masse, from location to location, messing about. We had a lot of fun. I used a wide angle, shooting from below, to create something cinematic. I was looking at classic photography from 1950s Italy and America, as well as the martial arts movies and music videos I grew up with. And I chose this location for its movie-like quality. The theatre is one of the biggest in Africa: I liked that it is obviously Arabic – and unfinished. Also, its modern appearance contrasts with the women’s traditional garb.There were four cinemas in my town when I was growing up in Morocco. I remember the movie posters they’d put in their windows. They had these powerful single images your mind could latch on to, allowing anyone who couldn’t afford a ticket to imagine the whole film. That’s what I wanted to create here – a still from a movie you haven’t seen.

I’m from a traditional Bangladeshi Muslim background and back then my life in east London was very different. We didn’t have social media, or even mobile phones – just going to a friend’s house was difficult because my parents were very protective. I didn’t wear much make-up and rather than flick through magazines and read about beauty like other girls my age, I would devour anything I could find about Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee.But at 18, my life changed. I went to a Muay Thai class (a form of kickboxing that’s generally regarded as the world’s toughest martial art) and found something I’d never experienced before.When I’m training and competing, I don’t care about the way I look. I feel confident in just being me. I’ll wear a really hydrating moisturiser so that my skin feels good but that’s all. Away from the ring, it’s a different story. I love fashion and makeup. Thanks to my career – I became the British and world champion for Muay Thai boxing for my weight category in 2016 – I go to a lot of awards ceremonies, and for those, I like to wear heels and a beautiful dress. I’ll go with foundation, concealer, lipstick, blusher and maybe a highlighter if I’m in the mood. I have an extensive makeup collection – I like to look elegant and pretty when I’m away from the gym but I still want to look like me. No fake eyelashes!As a society, we’re keen to put people into boxes – either you’re sporty or glamorous, you can’t be both … but that’s not true. I can be taken seriously as an athlete and look glamorous when I’m outside the ring. I firmly believe that when it comes to how you look and who you are, you should never try to please other people – if you’re pleased with yourself, then it will radiate through.When I started doing this, I was simply following a passion. Later on, I realised that I had become a role model and I didn’t know how to embrace that. But eventually, I said to myself, you’ve got an amazing platform to really inspire the next generation: to inspire girls, Muslim women, people with ME and chronic fatigue (I’ve suffered for years), people from ethnic minorities, people from low-income backgrounds – these are all obstacles I’ve faced in my own journey. But I’ve succeeded and because of that I feel confident and, yes, beautiful too. Being beautiful is simply about being bold and embracing who you are – that, combined with learning your craft and working hard, is what makes people respect you.At the moment, so many girls are reluctant to pursue sport and I think that’s often because they see it as somehow unfeminine. That’s something I’m determined to change. I train girls and some of them comment on my Instagram feed, and say it’s amazing that I don’t use filters to make myself look better in photos. I try to explain that I don’t need to do that because I’m confident in how I look – whether that’s sweating and makeup-free in the ring, or all dressed up, in mascara and lipstick. Either way, I’m comfortable as I am and that’s what I want them to feel, too. I want them to discover what their bodies are capable of – everyone has strengths and it’s about discovering yours and pursuing that.This year, I’ve switched from Muay Thai to boxing. It’s a completely different discipline. While I’ve got the strength and the fighter’s mentality from kickboxing, the timing, the balance, the guard and the footwork are all different. I’m in training twice a day, six days a week, and living on a very strict diet while I build my foundations in this new sport. I know the road might not be straight but I’m not going to give up. A fighter’s mentality is about having resilience. When I’m in the ring, my coach and my manager won’t be able to help me.

The reality, however, is that much of the beauty knowledge and knowhow I put into practice on a regular basis has been inspired by some of the amazing women in my life – from my mother to my favourite makeup artist – who have shared their tips and tricks with me. And now I am sharing them with you.Mind your décolletageLong before neck creams became a thing, my mother always highlighted the importance of treating your décolletage (that space between your chin and your chest) as you would the skin on your face. Although I was barely into my teens, she made a (daily) point of making sure I had meticulously washed and moisturised my neck and chest. She was adamant that if I didn’t do this, the texture and hue beyond my chin would start to look significantly different to the one on my face. It was exhausting having this relentless mantra sounding in your ear. As a young girl, taking care of the skin on my neck was the least of my priorities. Decades later, however, my mother’s advice has paid off she spoke the truth. It is a beauty step I follow to this day, and I now tell everyone who cares to listen, because it is never too late to start.So far, so perfect. But what happens when, one day, you look in the mirror and for some strange reason your perfect foundation doesn’t look quite as perfect as it did before? “Don’t blame it on the foundation,” says my long-time makeup artist friend. She believes a myriad of reasons could affect the finish – your hormones, change in season (every girl needs more than one shade to accommodate this), lack of sleep … “It’s all about how you store it,” she says. Most people keep their foundation in the (humid, steamy) bathroom, or in their bedroom, where it is exposed to the sun and direct light. All of this oxidises your foundation, which affects the colour, texture and its appearance when on your skin. The trick to keeping your perfect foundation perfect, she reveals, is to keep it in the fridge. Trust me, it works.Apply concealer after foundationMy younger sister is a huge beauty fan, but she doesn’t work in the beauty industry and by no means would she ever even call herself an expert. And yet I learn some of the most wonderful tricks and tips from her. She is the one who first introduced me to the joys of concealers. From her I learned that applying your foundation first and your concealer second is a much better way to ensure you don’t overdo it and end up with a cakey finish halfway through the day. I love a concealer that feels lightweight but provides full flawless coverage, such as the Clinique Beyond Perfecting Super Concealer, but when I apply my foundation first, I find I don’t need to use half as much – everything blends much more seamlessly and it stays that way all day.Supercharge your beauty routine with hyaluronic acidOne of the benefits of my job is that I get to meet women who are doing incredible things in the beauty industry. One of my favourites is a prolific dermatologist who works with some of Hollywood’s most famous faces. She was one of the first skincare experts I heard extolling the benefits of hyaluronic acid, which holds 1,000 times its weight in moisture. It has become my skincare mainstay. My dermatologist encouraged me to blend it into my foundation and powder highlighter before applying – this gives you the dewiest skin ever. She also advised mixing it into powdery or glittery eyeshadows – it is kinder to the eyes, goes on the lids without dragging and the end result is a much more silky, modern-looking finish, with major skincare benefits.Top up your SPF with clever mists Facials are quite possibly my favourite beauty treatment. I tend to battle uneven skin tone, so a good facial complements my skincare regime, which is infused with brighteners, acid exfoliators, vitamin C and a good SPF. Without sun protection, UV rays exacerbate my hyperpigmentation issues. And so I have long been religious about using a high SPF every day. What I didn’t know, however, was that I was doing it all wrong. My facialist taught me that my SPF is only effective when it is constantly topped up (ideally every two hours). This, of course, poses a dilemma: how on earth do you keep applying SPF throughout your working day, while you still have your makeup on? She introduced me to the idea of sunscreen mists and makeup-setting sprays that have SPF in them (some pressed powders also have SPF in, and can be brushed on during the day). Not only are these mists brilliant for dealing with the heat and refreshing your face and providing protection, but you can also spray them right through the day without it ruining your makeup.

Kimmel then asked if she knew if it would be changed. “I’ve been in discussions with them and they’re gracious,” she said. “They obviously didn’t want this to happen.”She has also been told that she will have approval over the next attempt.On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the host started by creating a memorable mental image. “We have passed certain milestones on Trump’s highway to American greatness,” he said. “Sometimes you just have to pull the car over, get a breath of fresh air, maybe puke in the grass.”He believes that one of those moments is now after Trump called for an investigation into the investigation into him.“Some people are calling this a constitutional crisis but I don’t know about that,” he said. “A constitutional crisis technically requires that one branch of the government push back against another branch of the government. Everybody here is pushing in the same direction, and it’s down with a pillow over the constitution’s face going: ‘Sssssshhhh, it’ll be over soon.’”He then joked that the constitution has changed under Trump’s reign. “It’s gotten so bad that the opening words have gone from ‘We the people’ to ‘Help, I’ve forgotten the safe word,’” he said.On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host covered the aides and officials who have been fired and rehired during Trump’s time in the White House. Before he became president, Trump said he would work hard to employ ferocious and mean people to get the job done. “I have to give Trump credit here,” he said. “He did warn us that he was going to hire some vicious, horrible people and he followed through.”Meyers spoke about Carl Higbie, who was originally hired as the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service – yet fired after hateful comments resurfaced that showed him to be a bigot.Yet despite this, he was ultimately given a job by a pro-Trump group promoting his policy agenda.“So Higbie did something terrible but instead of getting rid of him, they just moved him to a new job,” he said. “To put it in Catholic terms, he got moved to another diocese.”Meyers continued: “The guy who repeatedly said racist things about black people is still on the board that is run by the National Diversity Coalition. That’s like Charlie Sheen teaching D.A.R.E.”Similarly, Trump’s ex-assistant John McAntee was escorted off the White House premises after it was found that he was under investigation for serious financial crimes. Yet he’s now working on Trump’s re-election campaign.“So he got escorted off the White House grounds and into a promotion,” he said. “That’s like getting thrown out of a bar and the bouncer saying, ‘Get out and stay out and then come back tomorrow because you’re the manager now.’”He continued: “Trump keeps recycling these people and others because he only uses one yardstick to measure employees: are they loyal to me? And the problem with that is the kind of people who are unquestionably loyal to an ignorant bigot like Trump are pretty much always terrible people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc552774223a7e2c89d97935d4602df6d86b8daf/0_0_2338_1402/master/2338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00cf3b435d159c66b1086284fd6a92d","title":"great british bee count 2018 in pictures","story":"As the fifth annual Great British Bee Count gets under way, wildlife and gardening experts are calling on the public to grow weeds to help Britain’s bees.

McKellen, who had been approached to play Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films, said: “Well, nobody looks to Hollywood for social commentary, do they? They only recently discovered that there were black people in the world.”He continued: “Hollywood has mistreated women in every possible way throughout its history. Gay men don’t exist.”McKellen credited 1998’s Gods and Monsters – in which he played director James Whale – as triggering a new climate of acceptance in the industry, saying it “was the beginning of Hollywood admitting that there were gay people knocking around, even though half of Hollywood is gay”.McKellen came out publicly in 1988 and has been an industrious campaigner for equal rights ever since. He was speaking to promote documentary McKellen: Playing the Part, which screens in cinemas on Sunday, followed by a live Q\u0026ampA with the actor and Graham Norton.

He suggested that he did not envisage wholesale changes to the playing squad, which finished in sixth place over this past Premier League campaign. “This team is a big team, with big players, good players and we think we need to change little things – a few players.” Emery said.“The target is to be a candidate and to challenge for the title. It is very important for the club, after two years outside the Champions League, to work this way, to be the best club, the best team in the Premier League and also in the world.“What would be success this season? Developing, but how do you develop? I think that’s about battling for every title. That’s something that’s in Arsenal’s history, it’s in my history as well, and I want that to continue. Our objective is to be among the best in Europe, so those are the two objectives. I also want the team to make the fans proud of the side.”Emery was asked about his style. “My idea is to be protagonists – to play against all the teams with this personality. The history here is a team that love playing with possession of the ball. I like that personality. When you don’t have possession, I want a squad that are very, very intensive with the pressing. The two things are important for me to be protagonists – possession of the ball and pressing when you don’t have the ball.”Gazidis spoke at length about the process that led to Emery’s appointment – the starting point of which, he said, was that “every coach in the world would be interested in this position. We believe there is not a position in world football that is more attractive than Arsenal football club.”Gazidis, Sanllehi and Mislintat drew up an eight-man shortlist, which is known to have included Mikel Arteta and Max Allegri. “All of those eight people were interested in the position and all of those eight people took part in extensive, in-person interviews with us,” Gazidis said. “None of them at any stage withdrew their interest. They were interested right until the moment we informed them of our decision.”The announcement that Wenger would step down at the end of the season was made on 20 April and Gazidis said the interviews took place between 25 April and Tuesday of last week. The list was whittled down to three contenders and, at that point, Arteta – the Manchester City coach – was the favourite. Emery was interviewed on 10 May.But after careful consideration, Gazidis said that last Friday, the committee unanimously agreed to recommend the appointment of Emery to the board. “The formal recommendation to the board was supported by a 100-page dossier with references, analysis, videos showing their coaching in action and a great degree of background information,” Gazidis said.Emery met the London-based members of the club’s board on Monday before flying to Atlanta that night with Gazidis and Sanllehi to meet the majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, and his son Josh. They returned on the Tuesday night red-eye. “All of the board members were energised and enthusiastic about the recommendation and enthusiastically endorsed it,” Gazidis said.Gazidis said that Emery had been hugely impressive in his 10 May interview, when he had “an analysis of our inidual players, their qualities and how he feels he can help them develop inidually and collectively in detail”.Gazidis noted that Emery always improved his teams. “The distinguishing thing was the chemisty between us and the feeling for football in the room,” he added. “Unai has an energy. All of our players will respond to the new energy that Unai brings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7d4184da16db822c94e6b752f632cf444e13c3/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0718305133404facfd333c04ed2ce","title":"while the city sleeps london after hours a photo essay","story":"Photographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensPhotographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensIn the changing rooms backstage at Proud Cabaret in London, half a dozen performers are crammed together preparing themselves for the evening’s shows. As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, approximately 40,000 vehicles and 4,000 cyclists travel through the half-mile long tunnel every day.“We have only one opportunity every three months to close the tunnel and carry out all repairs, maintenance and cleaning for the next three,” says Stewart Wilson, Asset Operations Manager. “You really feel the pressure when you have a dozen jobs that all need to be carried out at once, before the tunnel reopens.”Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”“London can be rough when you’re on the streets. I’ve had some good times, I’ve had some bad times,” says Ken, one of the residents.“You’ve got to understand that to get into The Connection you’ve got to spend at least four nights on the street. They’ve got to see you sleeping out. There are people who’ve been out a lot longer than that, though. At least here you’ve got a bunk and the staff are quite helpful.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/845024883b316ad6d511b650265c74f2d6e401d7/0_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce724c20e07650068e359fa43fe77d0b","title":"western consumers fund extremism by buying talcum powder claims study","story":"Talc used in products sold in Europe and the US is often mined in Afghanistan by Isis and the Taliban, finds reportIslamic State and the Taliban are engaged in a bitter battle over control of mines in Afghanistan that supply much of the talcum used by European and US consumers.The mineral, used in everything from baby powder and cosmetics to paint and car parts, is mined in areas of eastern Afghanistanwhere the Taliban and Islamic State in Afghanistan are vying for supremacy.The struggle to control the extraction of talc and other minerals, such as chromite, has been exposed in a new report by Global Witness. The campaign group has spent months investigating how the murky trade means western consumers are effectively supporting insurgents in the country. Nick Donovan, campaign director for Global Witness, said that while talc lacked the imaginative allure of blood diamonds, which have featured in Hollywoods films and global rap music hits, it was nonetheless a “blood mineral”.“This report shows the insidious way in which insurgents have become involved in talc mining and the threat of groups like Isis becoming more involved,” said Donovan.He added that, while the Taliban’s involvement in talc mining is now well established, the move by the Afghan branch of Isis into mining the mineral appeared to follow a pattern whereby the group attempts to seize and exploit resources as a way of funding its efforts. The trend has been particularly marked in Iraq and Syria, where the group has moved into crude oil refining.According to the report, Isis in Afghanistan now controls large talc, marble and chromite mines in eastern Afghanistan, particularly around their stronghold in Achin district in Nangarhar province, the same area where the US military dropped the “mother of all bombs” against Isis-held caves in April 2017.Several sources interviewed for the report said significant mining has taken place under Isis since they took control. The group has fought major battles with the Taliban over neighbouring districts containing even richer deposits.One former security source told researchers they believed Isis had been involved in trying to construct a road to Pakistan to export minerals from areas controlled by the group.“The Islamic State appears to have a significant strategic interest in Afghanistan’s minerals and controls some major mining areas,” said Donovan. “Given its track record of exploiting natural resources in Iraq and Syria, this should be a wake-up call for both the Afghan government and the Trump administration.“They must strengthen control over the trade in places like Nangarhar, but just as importantly put in place desperately needed transparency and oversight reforms so that legitimate mining has a chance to provide a viable alternative.”The findings of the Global Witness investigation follow research suggesting that the Taliban is making millions annually from talc as part of the estimated $300m (£225m) a year they rake in from minerals across Afghanistan. Almost all of Afghanistan’s talc is exported to Pakistan, said the report, which in turn exports more of it to the US than to any other country. Pakistan provides more than a third of US imports of talc, with EU countries also major buyers. “Unwitting American and European consumers are inadvertently helping fund extremist groups in Afghanistan,” said Donovan, adding that a ban on the talc trade in Afghanistan, imposed in early 2015, had been weakly enforced – not least because of the involvement of political figures in the trade.

I was particularly drawn to the compact evergreen cultivar Euphorbia ‘Black Pearl’ in Chris Beardshaw’s Morgan Stanley garden, although I also spotted architectural caper spurge (E. lathyris, often maligned as a weed), bright-yellow-flowered Wallich spurge (E. wallichii) and lime-yellow cushion spurge (E. epithymoides) all over the showground.2 Fancy giving room to the prehistoric-looking black-ribbed stalks of scouring rush (Equisetum hyemale), which popped up in a couple of Chelsea gardens this year? Don’t be put off because it’s a relative of the horribly invasive weed horsetail: this is a brilliant low-maintenance architectural plant that loves swampy spots and pond edges. It was shown off to good effect in Nic Howard’s garden, set against a simple charcoal-grey wall and softened with Mexican fleabane (Erigeron karvinskianus). Stuart Towner paired it with Hosta ‘Devon Green’, Japanese forest grass (Hakonechloa macra), Gunnera magellanica and European wild ginger (Asarum europaeum). Scouring rush will spread relentlessly if given free rein, so contain it in a trough or water feature.3 If you are looking for low-maintenance, low-cost alternatives to paving your front garden, gravel has much to recommend it, and at this year’s Chelsea several gardens took this theme in different directions. Sarah Price showed how to use a Mediterranean plant palette with the papery pink flowers of the Cretan rockrose (Cistus creticus) and the vivid red flower clusters of the blood pink (Dianthus cruentus). Gravel’s also a good mulch for shade planting: see Nic Howard’s row of the huge (and thankfully slug-resistant) leaves of Hosta ‘Sum and Substance’ planted in gravel along a narrow bed that would work perfectly in a gloomy side return.4 If I was in any doubt about the rise of the houseplant, the visitors swarming over the displays of cacti, succulents and orchids in the Great Pavilion were proof of their staying power. It’s not only because these plants are so Instagrammable – Popsy the Cactus from Craig House Cacti is now so popular she has her own Twitter account – but because for many of us without much outside space, an air plant or two is a far more realistic prospect. A collaboration between Ikea and Indoor Garden Design offers clever ways to display plants indoors, from space-saving hanging planters to planters on peg boards. You’ll see houseplants creeping into show gardens, too, from the blue chalksticks succulent (Senecio serpens) in Sarah Price’s garden to the cast-iron plants (Aspidistra elatior) dotted through Stuart Towner’s garden.5 Want garden furniture that will never require repainting and doesn’t need covering in winter? What about a slab of rock? Jo Thompson’s show garden for Wedgwood shows how it’s done, with flat-topped chunks of York stone serving as chair or table or both simply add a comfy cushion or blanket. Just make sure you think carefully about where to position them, as you won’t be able to move them easily. If you’re more of a wood type, take the lead from Nic Howard, whose garden seats are simple cubes of oak, charred and shaped to make the perfect resting spot.6 If summer bedding leaves you cold, try planting up containers with succulents instead. The Pearlfisher garden cleverly employed echeverias, kalanchoes, sedums, crassulas and the like to mimic an underwater scene, while communicating its message about the perils of marine plastic pollution. The key to success is a very free-draining growing medium (use cactus and succulent compost, and choose a pot with plenty of holes in the bottom) and the sunniest spot you can muster. Remember to bring them inside to a frost-free place once summer starts to fade.7 It may be the flower show, but some gardens demonstrated that big and bold foliage can offer as much impact. Stuart Towner’s Spirit of Cornwall garden is a masterclass in combining different shapes and textures to create a big-leaved border, using the palmate-leaved false castor oil plant (Fatsia japonica), the pleated leaves of rodgersias and the huge corrugated leaves of Chilean rhubarb (Gunnera manicata). If you want a really unusual bold-leaved foliage shrub for your garden, get your hands on a spikenard (Aralia cordata), as shown off by Tom Stuart-Smith in his Weston garden in the Great Pavilion.8 Bare concrete in a garden is usually shorthand for something ugly and municipal, but this year’s Chelsea shows how to use this material in an inspired way, from the concrete cubes that break up frothy planting in Robert Barker’s Skin Deep conceptual garden to Stuart Towner’s simple oval concrete patio in his Spirit of Cornwall garden. Just make sure the lines are clean, the finish professional and the planting abundant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e730e9f257d4d40f6443f7cc8896d2818f9ba5/0_460_5436_3262/master/5436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e95d1d2ba22e38f46d394ae9f87e5e","title":"ditch the tin foil and channel yotam ottolenghi how to enjoy eating outdoors","story":"From flying insects to the weather, Mother Nature can be a cruel mistress. Here’s how to master British summer picnics and barbecues and realise your alfresco dining fantasies The simple pleasures of dining alfresco are a well-worn topic at this time of year: it is hardly news that food tastes better in the open air, even if it is more likely to be our appreciation, rather than our perception of flavour, that is enhanced by the novel surroundings of a cliff top, a sailing dinghy or even a park bench.Indeed, although the rustic romance of un déjeuner sur l’herbe has inspired writers and painters for centuries, the picturesque results tend to be heavily seasoned with artistic licence. No wasps hang around the fruit basket in Manet’s painting and nary a seagull e-bombs the bread and cheese as Virginia Woolf’s fractious family finally make their voyage to the lighthouse. If the Famous Five’s tinned sardines ever leaked fishy oil all over the rug, I don’t remember it, while Renoir’s boating party seem bizarrely untroubled by the distinct possibility that the small dog on the table will upset their wine glasses.These are fantasies of alfresco life, but in truth Mother Nature is a cruel mistress who doesn’t give a fig for your carefully laid plans or meticulously sliced cucumber sandwiches – which is why it pays to come prepared for all eventualities. Here’s a guide to dealing with a few of the challenges likely to crop up as soon as the words “it’s a lovely day!” leave your mouth.These days, most special diets are easy to cater for with a little notice – but when someone texts on the day to inform you they have gone plant-based, or gluten-free, it can be tempting to reply telling them to bring their own bloody lunch. Before you do, count to 10 and channel Yotam Ottolenghi: a Middle Eastern feast will keep everyone happy. Big bowls of hummus or baba ganoush, paired with a salad of roasted or barbecued veg and some falafel or vegetable fritters are sure to go down a treat with omnivores, too – add pitta or other flatbreads to bulk it out, then finish with fruit and meringues or damp, sticky polenta cake. Most of these are gluten free and can easily be made vegan too. Failing that, almost all supermarkets carry a wide range of free-from products – and everyone likes crisps, right?Even the most committed animal lover might be hard-pressed to welcome our flying friends to the feast – but if you are eating outside, a certain insect presence is inevitable to be fair to them, it’s where they live. The best way of deterring wasps and bees is thought to be to trap the first inquisitive scout before it returns to the nest weighed down with ketchup and alerts 250 of its nearest and dearest to the free buffet going on in your back garden. Avoid setting up camp close to ponds or the standing water beloved of mozzies and midges instead, embrace the fresh air of a breezy hilltop – most flying insects hate both wind and smoke, which is a great excuse for a barbecue or a campfire.The crunch of sand between the teeth may seem as inevitable a part of eating on the beach as a stiff wind and a Mr Whippy for pudding, but there are ways to reduce your silica consumption. Go for food such as wraps, filled baguettes and oranges that can be eaten straight from their wrappers (see below for eco-friendly options) with minimal contact with the gritty environment. Make sure you rinse your hands, preferably with fresh water, before you even think of unpacking anything, although even a bucket of sea water is better than nothing.Obviously, sun is welcome whether you are planning a barbie in the back garden or a celebratory drink at the top of a mountain, but it can be problematic keeping food fresh in the heat. A good rule of thumb is to choose dishes from warmer climes: cured salami and ham are more robust than poached salmon or coronation chicken, just as parmesan, manchego or feta will do better than cheddar or stilton in sunshine. (That said, if you are eating at home, or can keep them flat in transit, bries, camemberts and their ilk come into their own after a few hours outside the fridge.) Crunchy carrots and radishes and Mediterranean veg are preferable to leafy greens, and vinaigrettes tend to hold up better than mayonnaise in high temperatures. If you are making sandwiches ahead of time, consider replacing the butter with avocado mashed with lemon juice, or a soft cheese.This is more likely to be a problem in the UK than sun, sadly – but all is not lost if the forecast begins to look grim one of the best picnics I have ever eaten was consumed in the very damp shadow of a dry-stone wall on Scafell Pike in December. As on a beach, choose foods that can be eaten straight from the wrappers, and avoid soft bread or delicate pastry: you’d be surprised how water-repellent a pork pie or scotch egg is compared with your average loaf of sliced white. If you are taking advantage of a brief break in the clouds to picnic, pack a waterproof layer to protect the rug, and your bottoms, from soggy grass. If the forecast looks similarly grim for a long-planned barbecue and you cannot fit the grill under cover, or prop a well-weighted umbrella over it, then go for dishes such as jerk chicken or ribs, which can be cooked in advance and then finished off either on a grill or a hot pan, depending on how the sky is looking, or choose recipes that work in the oven as well as on the barbecue.If you are planning to eat a few hundred yards from your own kitchen, I probably do not need to tell you that a tray will come in handy. For picnics at distant beauty spots and barbecues on the beach, however, it pays to consider the very unromantic question of logistics. Some foods travel better than others exquisite Parisian pastries will not look quite so pretty once they have been carted up a hill, but a sturdy British pie with a hot water crust could probably be kicked up there without much damage. Hard cheeses, cooked meats, boiled eggs and crunchy pickles are all good choices, as are soft things such as hummus or potato salad, which won’t mind being shaken about a bit. If you must take ripe tomatoes or stone fruits, then wrap them in newspaper as carefully as fine china, and put them in storage boxes. Cold drinks can be happily decanted into Thermos flasks full of ice.One of the chief pleasures of picnics in particular is their simplicity: unless physical necessity demands it, this is not the time for tables and chairs. Much lovelier to lounge about on the grass, sand or a sun-warmed rock and feel at one with nature as you shovel Pringles into your gob. In reality, all of those surfaces can be prickly, damp or downright spiky – so if you can manage to lug along a stout, preferably waterproof rug as well as the food, all the better (a sheet of plastic, or a few large Ikea bags, underneath an ordinary rug, does the job just as well). If you are planning to sit for a while, you might also like to suggest each guest brings a cushion as head support for an eminently sensible postprandial nap, and consider bringing a parasol as a sunshade: though a hat apiece is considerably easier to carry. Proper cloth napkins not only give a picnic an air of sophistication but are much more useful than paper ones, which tend to disintegrate at the mere sight of mayonnaise – and, of course, they are endlessly reusable, as well as handy for wrapping any crockery, glasses, boiled eggs and so on.As above, if you are eating away from home, keep it simple. Go for finger food – crudités and dips, burgers, hot dogs or samosas – and all you need are napkins to wipe your hands afterwards, although a bottle opener is sure to come in useful at most British picnics, as will some beakers. (Unless you want to be lugging those around yourself, ask everyone to bring their own – it will save on the washing up too.) If you are planning to barbecue away from home, invest in a small portable grill rather than wasteful disposable ones: some models are hardly more expensive, and you will be able to enjoy them for many summers to come. Barbecues will never be the most eco-friendly option of course, but you can also help by fuelling them with sustainable British lumpwood charcoal.Naturally, this should be kept to a minimum – principally for environmental reasons, although aesthetically there is little to spoil the simple elegance of a picnic like outrageous amounts of plastic wrap strewn across the rug. This should not be a problem if you are making the food yourself: there are plenty of good eco-friendly options out there, from sandwich wraps to Indian tiffin boxes, which are not only reusable, but far easier on the eye than tin foil, and a lot better at their job as well. Unless you are feeding the 5,000, you may prefer to decant condiments and seasonings into small jars (I collect tiny jam jars from hotel breakfasts for the purpose), though always leave dressing salads and sandwiches until the last minute, if possible, to minimise the risk of things going soggy and slimy in transit.In theory, without all that rubbish to deal with, this should be relatively painless: box up any leftovers for tomorrow’s lunch, then sluice out dirty containers with water if it is available and going spare, and roughly dry with the aforementioned napkins before packing away. It’s always a good idea to take a couple of bags for any disposable packaging and recycling you do manage to accumulate, and if you are likely to be somewhere without water, a few damp flannels in a waterproof washbag will be invaluable for cleaning hands and faces before you release any trapped wasps, shake out the rug and head home, smug in the knowledge you have done your patriotic duty by the great British summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee007c78e9aeed218f7d0da4be670670a6063a7c/0_277_5189_3113/master/5189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=693bd2ba504e41e1ab1154994ba89f47","title":"natalie lee joes recipe for pork tonkatsu sando","story":"This fried pork cutlet sandwich is a bit naughty, super tasty and the perfect late-night indulgencePork tonkatsu sando – fried breaded pork cutlet in a sandwich – is something I\u0026nbsplove cooking when I get home late at night.

But just getting through the qualifying races is an epic feat in itself When you tell other ultra runners that you are training for the Ultra-Trail du Mont- Blanc (UTMB), they give you a certain look. Oh, you are a serious ultra runner. You can almost feel your trail cred rising.Not because the UTMB is the toughest race, or the longest, or in the most extreme conditions – although it is fairly extreme, being a 105-mile race around Mont Blanc that traverses a route with a total ascent of 34,000ft (10,300m) and passes through three different countries.The main reason they give you that subtle nod of kudos is because just qualifying for the UTMB is an epic feat in itself. To even enter the ballot for a place, you have to accumulate points by running three qualifying races. While you do not need to win or do particularly well in any of these races – unless you’re shooting for an elite place at the UTMB – you do need to finish them all within the cut-offs.But now I have a place. The UTMB is also the most competitive ultra trail in the world, with more of the top elite runners turning up each year, treating it as the grand final, the unofficial world championships of the sport. I have no illusions about being competitive anywhere near the front of this race, but after just over a year of ultra running, when something has gone wrong in every race I have run, I am working on being as good as I can be, for what will be the culmination of my two-year ultra running adventure.It began last February when I decided to shoot for the UTMB and ran the first qualifying race, and my first ever ultra, a 35-mile jaunt along the coastal path near my home in south Devon. Since then, I have got lost in races, worn the wrong shoes, forgotten to carry water, had extreme lows – clinging to the side of a mountain during a storm in the night –and extreme highs, when I felt like superman, flying up Holyhead mountain 130 miles into the Ring O Fire Anglesey race, unable to believe that these legs that had struggled even to walk a few hours earlier now felt brand new, straight out of the box and filled with rocket fuel.And so, with my entry to the UTMB confirmed, last weekend I took on one of two final warm-up races before the big one. It was a mere 45-mile race along the Jurassic coast in Dorset. “Just a baby ultra,” I kept telling people beforehand.My latest lesson in this sport is never to underestimate an ultra race. The numbers in ultra running are so big and insane that they start to become meaningless in the space between the races, when you’re talking and thinking about them rather than actually running them. After some of the races I had already done, 45 miles seemed like nothing.That was until about 20 miles in, when I started cramping while climbing up some steps after running along Lulworth Cove beach. It was a hot day and I hadn’t taken in enough salt. Luckily the cramps went away, but then came three brutal hills in quick succession, cliffs, pure vertical madness, interspersed, of course, by three terrifying descents. By then, I was on the point of dropping out. I had my reasons clearly laid out in my mind. This was only a training race, and so 25 miles was quite far enough for a training run. And it was dangerous to run with cramps – they had come back a few times on those three hills. What if I got stuck on my own somewhere remote and couldn’t even walk. It was irresponsible to carry on.But something, and it is still hard for me to fathom quite what it is, pushed me on. Every time I resolved to stop, it said no. Go on, go a bit further. After a while, the miles still left to go and the distances already run started to blur, and my mind stopped counting, focused completely on the simple act of moving, even if it was merely shuffling. The cliff paths and seaside towns were full of holidaymakers enjoying a balmy weekend. I ran through them with my rucksack and the number pinned on my shirt like an oddball. But word of who we were had got out, and people cheered me on, telling me I was amazing, telling me to keep going. I tried to wave or smile back. When did I become the maddest guy in town? There were moments of exquisite beauty, when you would come across an isolated cove that took your breath away. In these ultras, you are so raw, that everything is more extreme. A hug from a loved one at an aid station, or the sudden appearance of nature in full bloom, can bring you close to tears. But you must go on. Perpetual forward motion is the goal. Race positions stop mattering – it ceases to become a race. I had started out with a goal time and position, but six hours on, none of that mattered. All that mattered was to keep moving, one step after another.The race ended at Old Harry Rocks. It was a setting to lift the spirits, but just finishing was ecstasy. To sit on the warm grass, take off my shoes and stare out to sea after eight and a half hours of running. In that moment, it all made sense.And so I have one more warm-up race left to go. A 78-mile run through the Dolomites in Italy. It is a scary prospect, lots more big numbers, but for now I am going to bask a little longer in the glory of another ultra completed. Another step along this crazy path I set out on when I decided, last February, to enter the UTMB.

The dispute has been settled without admission of fault.Maltby is understood to have been prepared to go to court over the claims made in the Pierce article and any court case could have involved No 10 staff and senior members of the Conservative party being called to give evidence.Her original claim against Green, that he hinted he could advance her career in exchange for an affair, was judged “plausible” by a Cabinet Office inquiry. However, Green ultimately lost his job after admitting that he had lied about the fact that pornography was found on his parliamentary computer during a police investigation in 2008.The inquiry also examined claims that Green or his allies influenced the Mail article, which called Maltby “one very pushy lady”. Green and his aides have strongly denied they contributed in any way to the attacks on Maltby.In her original piece for the Times, which prompted the inquiry, Maltby said Green had fleetingly touched her knee during a meeting in a Waterloo pub in 2015 to talk about her political career, as he mentioned that his own wife was “very understanding”.Maltby, who writes regularly for the Times, said Green also sent her a suggestive text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. In his resignation letter, Green said he did not recognise the events Maltby described in her article, “but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and for this I apologise”.Maltby told the : “Like many of the women who’ve spoken this year about abuse of power, I only felt able to speak publicly about inappropriate behaviour at Westminster because I had a strong media platform and was lucky enough to be able to afford legal representation.Samantha Rennie, executive director at Rosa, the UK-wide fund which manages the Time’s Up fund, welcomed Maltby’s £5,500 donation. “We can’t end the culture of impunity without generous people like Kate who inspire others to give,” she said. “Grants from the Justice and Equality Fund will be made to support organisations with a track record of success in tackling harassment and abuse, and of supporting people who have suffered it.”Maltby said the fund would “particularly focus on those less privileged … working-class women, women of colour, and those with other intersecting disadvantages” who were less able to face the brunt of harassment in the workplace.“It’s not enough for prominent white women to speak out against harassment from our relative safety. It is essential that we give tangible financial support to women who take greater financial risks in challenging power,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83db94297a0585413cba4ff308fc3a07f875ff95/48_219_2422_1453/master/2422.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ced6e2d3c5ab323d845570eb4af9498b","title":"britten sinfonia ades review gerald barry barbican london nicolas hodges","story":"In Barry’s words, his piece is more like a play or opera than a concerto. It’s a noisy dialogue between piano and the rest, the anatomy of an argument. It opens with a challenge from the brass – the trumpets are the ringleaders, the horns their sidekicks. The piano answers with self-assurance mixed with irritation and, while it might seem an unequal fight, the soloist has many weapons. These include not only force – at times the soloist hits clusters of notes with both forearms – but also smug certainty, which comes through in a passage that sounds almost like a five-finger exercise, travelling baldly up the keyboard and down again. You can almost hear the hot air – literally at times, when the wind machines on either side of the percussion section let rip. Flippant, cool and histrionic, it’s typical Barry, and initially at least it’s fun to hear but as response follows statement follows response it becomes wearing. This argument takes a long time to be fought through, and when at the end the piano is left alone repeating a little quiet figure to itself – a winner’s loneliness – it’s the first moment of real depth.Beethoven’s Symphony No 4, which opened the concert, peaked in the slow movement, the violins spinning their melodies into almost impossibly long threads. The finale, however, was a little heavy-handed there are passages in this movement that should perhaps be conducted with only a single eyebrow, and Adès’s energetic direction didn’t achieve that kind of nonchalance. His reading of No 5, however, was a winner – impatient yet disciplined, histrionic yet lyrical, it stressed the elements Beethoven and Barry share, and found resolution for all of them, ending the concert in triumphant exuberance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d541f24b86ec7161e0bb661981bf9f097f4811/0_61_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a8c4906325001f2dc8ede42ad074906","title":"rolling stones review london stadium jagger","story":"London StadiumThere are ragged moments – a shaky Under My Thumb, a leaden Paint It Black – but plenty of others where Jagger and co achieve liftoffIt is 37 years since the Rolling Stones more or less singlehandedly invented the latterday mega-tour. Huge artists had toured huge sports arenas before the Stones’ 1981 jaunt around the US, but not on that scale, not with that profit, and not with corporate sponsorship – courtesy of Jōvan Musk, an aftershave one suspects Mick Jagger was no more likely to wear than he was to spray himself with manure. There were also pay-per-view tie-ins and the early 80s equivalent of live streaming to cinemas: all the stuff one now expects when the rock aristocracy hit the road.The best part of four decades on, with umpteen tours that make their 1981 outing look like the apotheosis of understatement, you might imagine the Stones’ stadium show to be a thing of perfectly-drilled slickness. In a sense, it is. You get a lot of what you might expect to get at a Rolling Stones show in London, from Mick Jagger reminiscing about a long-lost local venue, Dalston Baths (or, as he puts it, “a place near ear called Dalston Barfs”), to footage on the big screens that evokes their past – when they were Britain’s premiere exponents of tough Chicago blues. And there’s the way the rock-solid drumming of Charlie Watts is augmented by the various facial expressions of Charlie Watts, every one of which somehow communicates that this nonsense is all a bit beneath him.But in a sense it isn’t slick at all. “Well, we made it frew,” sighs Jagger after a shaky version of Under My Thumb, a song he suggests the band play rarely these days, for obvious reasons. It displays what you might tactfully call an attitude to male-female relations that hails from a different era – but which the public have apparently voted they return to their set, in an online poll. Jagger himself sounds in pretty good shape for a man of 74, the only evidence of time’s passage on his voice is when he drops out of the falsetto in Fool to Cry. But said shakiness is what’s really gripping about the Stones live. Performing without the safety net of backing tracks – as much a part of the mega-tour these days as sponsorship deals – the band still occasionally feel shambolic, as if they’re just clinging on to the song by their fingernails: a ragged version of Street Fighting Man, a leaden plod through Paint It Black that carries none of the original version’s amphetamine paranoia. And then there are moments when everything suddenly gels and they achieve liftoff. Tonight, it happens first during Ride ’Em on Down, one of the old blues numbers they resurrected for 2016’s Blue and Lonesome – even though an audience here for the hits react to its announcement as if Jagger’s just informed them where the nearest lavatory is – and then again during Sympathy for the Devil, which kicks off a ferocious home run of songs. Miss You sounds suitably humid and intense Midnight Rambler rages along, its nastiness fully intact. You’re struck by the sense that they probably sounded not unlike this back in Dalston Barfs, flaws and all.In a world of stadium rock shows where every note seems perfectly choreographed and nothing is left to chance, it’s authentically thrilling and raw. The Rolling Stones have still, to borrow their old phrase, got live if you want it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7266cb4e82891526edb7e6bee419b5a22852cac/0_0_5750_3840/master/5750.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebb289ee86bf3aa1f94bde912b8344ff 700w","title":"all future labour peers must back abolition of lords says corbyn","story":"Corbyn is first recent Labour leader to make voting for abolition of upper chamber a condition for appointment of new peersJeremy Corbyn has said any new peers appointed by his party must support Labour’s position of abolishing the House of Lords if ever offered a parliamentary vote on its future.The Labour leader, a long-time advocate of replacing the upper house with an elected chamber, has already made the pledge a condition for the appointment of three new peers announced on Friday.The government can create new peers whenever it likes. But there are a few conventions, agreed between all the parties, and all nominations for a peerage have to be approved. Tax dodging and criminal convictions usually rule out appointment. Outgoing prime ministers often reward old chums with a peerage. Occasionally an MP is propelled into the Lords to create a spare seat in the Commons. By recent custom, peers are created without shifting the balance of power from no overall control.No, and famously the Lords is the second biggest legislative chamber after China’s national people’s congress. It has 750 members, of whom 150 or so inherited their titles. When one dies there is an election among other hereditaries in the same party. When the Lib Dem peer Lord Avebury died, an electorate of three voted for his successor. Efforts at shrinking it have led to a retirement scheme but not much else.Most democratic countries have an elected second chamber, if they have a second chamber at all. Some have a mix of appointed and elected. Efforts to reform the house of lords have foundered on disagreement on questions of scale - how big, what proportion should be elected and on what basis - first past the post, single transferable vote, alternative vote … a fresh start would make almost anything possible.\u0026nbsp One idea gaining traction is that it should represent the United Kingdom, bringing together England, Scotland, northern Ireland and Wales in a kind of federal body. But the most contentious question is always whether an elected second chamber would have more powers, which would weaken the House of CommonsThe trio of new peers, former Labour party general secretary Iain McNicol, campaigner Martha Osamor and socialist writer Pauline Bryan, have all signed up to the principle of replacing the Lords with a new, more democratic model. Senior Labour figures suggested the move was “well past overdue” and that transforming the House of Lords must take place to address the democratic deficit. Corbyn said: “It is a democratic necessity to abolish the unelected and outdated House of Lords and replace it with an elected second chamber. “We cannot continue to let political insiders, who the public can’t get rid of, have so much influence over our country’s laws. The next Labour government will renew our democracy and take power back from out-of-touch elites.” Party insiders suggested that Corbyn had been reluctant to appoint any new peers but was concerned that Labour could be at a disadvantage as Theresa May unveiled nine of her own on the same day.“While it exists, it is important that we have the strongest Labour voice there to make sure that the government is held to account and to make sure that Labour priorities are pushed as strongly as they can be,” the spokesman said. One of those new peers, Bryan, wrote on a blog for the RedRobin website: “I was asked to accept a nomination on the basis that a) I would take it on as a job and work with the Labour team b) that when the opportunity arose I would vote for its abolition. It was also important that I was from outside the London bubble.” Corbyn has only nominated four people for Labour peerages since he became leader in 2016. Frontbencher Shami Chakrabarti was the only Labour peer to be named as part of David Cameron’s resignation honours. He is the first recent Labour leader to make voting for abolition of the Lords a condition of a peer’s appointment.His spokesman’s comments appear to go further than Labour’s manifesto, which said that while the party’s “fundamental” belief was that the second chamber should be elected, in the meantime it would seek to end the hereditary principle and reduce the size of the existing chamber.Theresa May recently appointed nine new peers including former MPs and ministers, despite previously saying she was committed to “restraint” in handing them out. At prime minister’s questions, the SNP’s Pete Wishart said the latest increase in the numbers of peers, bringing the total to more than 800, was “cynical” and a “complete fix” after the Tories lost 15 key Brexit votes in the House of Lords. Labour also suffered a major rebellion when more than 80 of the party’s peers supported a plan, against the leadership’s will, to keep Britain in the single market. However, May’s spokesman defended the announcement, which came on the eve of the royal wedding. “We have been clear that there should be restraint on new appointments in the Lords, combined with an increased cross-party take up of retirements,” he said.“The prime minister has made clear that she will operate on the basis that there will no longer be an automatic entitlement of a peerage for any holder of high office in public life. The total size of the Lords has fallen since she took office.“The nominations reflect our determination that the House of Lords should contain people from various walks of life but also people who have expertise that can add to the overall contribution the house makes. I think that’s reflected in the list of nominations that you saw last week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb89f5721d7cf72579d23105ccf49f3b6c9bab7b/0_39_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef01df5fabf42e239986e4bee720eadd","title":"brexiters customs model could cost 20bn for uk business","story":"‘Max-fac’ option could result in huge annual hit for firms, according to head of HMRCThe post-Brexit customs model favoured by Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and Michael Gove could cost business as much as £20bn a year, the head of HMRC has said, a verdict that delivers a huge blow to the Brexiters’ hopes of a complete departure from the customs union. Jon Thompson told the Treasury select committee that their preferred “max-fac” model, which relies on technology and trusted trader schemes to minimise border checks, would be substantially more expensive than the alternative. Cabinet sources claimed that they had never been briefed by HMRC that the cost could be so high. The huge figure, which represents around double the UK’s annual net contribution to the EU, sent shockwaves around Westminster. Theresa May’s preferred option, the customs partnership model, under which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, would be virtually cost-free because businesses could claim back the levies, Thompson said. The prime minister has faced veiled threats from leading Brexiters including Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg in recent days to drop the partnership model and press ahead with their max-fac option instead.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.The issue has split both her cabinet and the wider Conservative party, with May forced to ide her cabinet into two groups to fight out their differences over Britain’s post-Brexit customs arrangements. Both options have already been dismissed by Brussels as “fantasy-island, unicorn” models. Brexiters have warned that a third “backstop” option, agreed by the cabinet last week in case the Irish border issue is not resolved speedily, must remain in place only for a short time, fearing that it could be a back-door means of keeping Britain tied to the EU indefinitely. Some in Westminster believe if Brussels accepts the UK’s alternative plan, which would keep Britain aligned with elements of the single market and customs union if no other agreement is reached, it could become the post-Brexit norm. However, there have been reports that Brussels might reject it. Downing Street played down the the HMRC’s £20bn estimate. May’s official spokesman said: “The prime minister has asked for work to be done on both customs models. That work is ongoing and therefore any speculation about implementation is just that.”However, Thompson told MPs that max fac would force firms to draw up UK customs declarations at £32.50 a time, while there would be similar charges on the EU side of the border. Rule-of-origin protections for particular products, such as Melton Mowbray pork pies, would mean higher charges still.“So you need to think about the highly streamlined customs arrangement costing businesses somewhere in the late teens of billions of pounds, somewhere between £17bn and £20bn,” he said. “The primary driver here is the fact that there are customs declarations.”The HMRC chief said there were approximately 200m intra-EU consignments made by firms each year, according to figures checked by the National Audit Office. The customs partnership model, by comparison, would in theory allow goods to cross the border without the need for comprehensive checks, which would be significantly more economical for businesses. They could expect to pay a maximum of £3.4bn a year in total, he told MPs, although in reality it could be “a net cost of zero or less, depending on the tariffs drawn up by the UK and Brussels, because businesses could claim them back”. The Treasury committee chair, Nicky Morgan, summarising the potential costs of the max-fac arrangements, asked Thompson whether it would be a relief if parliament voted for a customs union. He said it was for MPs to decide. Tory Brexiter Bim Afolami MP said the figures should give ministers pause for thought. “Leaving the customs union is the right policy, but whatever the solution we come up with must not be hugely costly and burdensome to British business. That would not be a good outcome,” he said.Thompson also said it would take between three to five years to begin implementing the UK’s new customs arrangements, depending on which of the two options were decided upon by the government. While they would be unable to begin putting them in place until a decision was made, he insisted that the UK border would still continue to operate from the moment Britain left the EU. However, he admitted that such a border might not be “fully optimal”.Even so, there could be issues posed by the land border in Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic. “There is a design challenge for us,” he said. “If you look around the world, even the most technologically advanced customs borders generally involve some kind of infrastructure,” he said.A No 10 spokesman said: “We have been clear on a number of occasions that our intention is to be ready by the end of the implementation period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6513e88afe04f558c40693d7e6fce786cad9413f/0_165_4938_2963/master/4938.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c07eb699db24e0e5ef4a836743f779e","title":"the friend effect why the secret of health and happiness is surprisingly simple","story":"For some, eating alone can be a joyous thing: forking mouthfuls of pasta straight from the pan, peanut butter licked off a spoon, the unbridled pleasure of walking home from the chippie alone on a cold night. But regularly eating meals in isolation is a different story. This one factor is more strongly associated with unhappiness than any other apart from (unsurprisingly) having a mental illness. This is according to a new study by Oxford Economics that found, in a survey of 8,250 British adults, that people who always eat alone score 7.9 points lower, in terms of happiness, than the national average.This research is far from the first to suggest a link between eating with others and happiness. Researchers at the University of Oxford last year found that the more that people eat with others, the more likely they are to feel happy and satisfied with their lives. The study also found that people who eat socially are more likely to feel better about themselves and have wider social and emotional support networks.Robin Dunbar, a professor of psychology, worked on the Oxford University study. He says that “we simply don’t know” why people who eat together are happier. But it is clear that this is a regular social ritual, a moment of union and communion in our often chaotic lives. It can be a place of conversation, storytelling and closeness.“At a psychological level, having friends just makes you happier,” says Dunbar. “The kinds of things that you do around the table with other people are very good at triggering the endorphin system, which is part of the brain’s pain-management system. Endorphins are opioids, they are chemically related to morphine – they are produced by the brain and give you an opiate high. That’s what you get when you do all this social stuff, including patting, cuddling and stroking. It is central to the way primates in general bond in their social groups and relationships.”Our face-to-face relationships are, quite literally, a matter of life or death. “One of the biggest predictors of physical and mental health problems is loneliness,” says Dr Nick Lake, joint director for psychology and psychological therapy at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. “That makes sense to people when they think of mental health. But the evidence is also clear that if you are someone who is lonely and isolated, your chance of suffering a major long-term condition such as coronary heart disease or cancer is also significantly increased, to the extent that it is almost as big a risk factor as smoking.”One of the most striking pieces of evidence for this, says Dunbar, is a meta-analysis of 148 epidemiological studies that looked for the best predictors that patients would survive for 12 months after a heart attack. “The best two predictors, by a long way, are the number and quality of friends you have and giving up smoking,” he says. “You can eat as much as you like, you can slob about, you can drink as much alcohol as you like – the effect is very modest compared with these other two factors.”Human beings are biologically engineered for human interaction – and particularly face-to-face interaction. One study from the University of Michigan found that replacing face-to-face contact with friends and family with messages on social media, emails or text messages could double our risk of depression. The study also found that those who made social contact with family and friends at least three times a week had the lowest level of depressive symptoms.“The ability to stimulate positive emotions, which is linked to happiness, begins in interactions with others who are having positive emotions about you. So, when we see our friends and they say, ‘Good to see you’ – it’s important.”But there are many factors that might prevent us from seeing friends and family: mental ill health, immobility, a lack of money. Alison Harris is a consultant clinical psychologist and professional lead for psychological services in Salford. “Austerity has a huge influence on the loss of happiness and wellbeing,” she says. “Homelessness and unemployment in particular takes us out of contact with others. In addition to the obvious harms of homelessness, it does massively increase social isolation and anxiety. To take that even further, many people are in exile from their communities. In mental health services, we see an enormous amount of grief, depression and anxiety in people who are asylum seekers and refugees and much of that is not just due to trauma or torture or detention or fleeing from their country, but from the severe rupture of being cut off from their families and communities of origin.”When we are around others, it has an effect on our body. Some forms of friendship – going to parties, getting married, having positive interactions with others – stimulate our sympathetic nervous system. Gilbert says that the parasympathetic nervous system (otherwise known as the “rest and digest” system) “is stimulated through the verbal and voice tone of relations with each other. As far as we know, it’s not that stimulated through texts. Generally speaking, you’re designed to respond to voice tone and expression, and stroking. We are physiologically designed for face-to-face interaction.”Of course, for those struggling with depression, the idea of physical contact can be impossible to fathom. At those moments, the capacity to lift up a mobile phone and type out a text is an enormous mark of progress. It may not be the ideal form of interaction, but it’s a vast improvement on staring at a wall.He says that what has happened in the past decade, with the rise of social media, “is that it has become a very plastic society. We are all living like theatrical actors, presenting ourselves as our best. That can’t be real, and so we have many people who feel like failures or useless. They say: ‘I’m not as attractive as that, I’m overweight, I’m not kind or compassionate to others.’”As Gilbert says, the best relationships are the ones where people love us for our perceived dark sides and flaws. “People forget that love is about loving you for the difficult things, not the easy things,” he says. It is those who know us intimately who can provide that, and they do it through their physical presence, through touch, and through eating, drinking and sharing with us. Spending time together is social nourishment. So, instead of texting a friend or messaging them on social media, why not knock on their door, look them in the eye and make yourselves both feel better?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83804273ef4347c787e0b79645ced902a629ff50/0_62_3977_2386/master/3977.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8471f15ec0284c2f2a8c55d52572fc4","title":"england dom bess jos buttler pakistan first test","story":"Performances of spinning newcomer and white-ball specialist will be closely watched in first Test against Pakistan when Alastair Cook and Ben Stokes will also be under spotlightWith uncertainty comes excitement and there are more uncertainties than usual as England begin their Test summer. So for those of a nervous disposition let me offer one cast-iron reassurance: in the field at Lord’s England will be a more vibrant, athletic outfit than they were last winter.The newcomer and the prodigal are brilliant fielders. Dom Bess, guaranteed to play according to Joe Root on the eve of the match, is a terrific presence in the field in the ring. So too is Jos Buttler, assuming he remembers how to do it. Before he was given the gloves Buttler was also a superb outfielder, fast and with safe hands, though if his return to Test cricket becomes permanent his slip-fielding prowess may have to be explored – this is not an area in which England have excelled recently beyond second slip.Now to the unknowns: the most eye-catching selection was the return of Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman. He has excelled in the Indian Premier League, which served as a reminder of the “unique gifts” Ed Smith referred to when announcing the squad. England have had specialist batsmen at seven before – Derek Randall, Mike Gatting, Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash have batted there – but it is hard to recall the side ever adopting the notion of a “specialist seven” with particular freedom to play in an aggressive manner, honed by white-ball cricket. This is unpredictable and appetising – though it is doubtful the Lord’s faithful will break into a slow handclap if Buttler has not played his “ramp shot” within 10 minutes of his arrival at the crease.The oddity about Bess’s selection is that he could be construed as the conservative choice once the sad news of Jack Leach’s broken thumb had surfaced. Bess toured with the Lions in the winter he has played 16 first-class games with the astonishing return of 63 wickets at 22 apiece and he can bat a bit as well as field. His most obvious rival is Surrey’s Amar Virdi, a year younger than Bess at 19 with only seven first-class appearances for Surrey and 23 wickets at 26 apiece.Even so Bess’s elevation is incredibly rapid he will be England’s youngest finger spinner and in first-class cricket he has seldom bowled on a pitch that does not turn, which is likely to be the case at Lord’s for at least three days. Once again here is a (glorious) uncertainty.It does not end there. It may be that Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes will be the support bowlers for Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. Like Buttler they have just flown from the IPL into a Lord’s Test without playing any red-ball cricket this season. This may well work, but it breaks with convention and it is not so hard to predict how one or two old players might riff on the impossibility of playing proper Test cricket with such scanty preparation if Stokes and Woakes bowl poorly or run out of puff in the final session.Woakes is not guaranteed to play. He is competing with Mark Wood for the last bowling slot and Root explained England would inspect the pitch early on Thursday morning before making their decision. It was tricky to inspect it on Wednesday since it was locked under a white tarpaulin and then, after a quick mow, the hover cover.Currently those covers are hiding a healthy amount of green grass but the fact that the pitch was hidden from the sun all day suggests the groundstaff are concerned that it may become too dry too quickly.The selection conundrum probably goes like this: if England think the ball is going to jag around then they are more likely to go for Woakes if the pitch looks flat and batsman-friendly they may prefer Wood, who played in England’s last Test in Christchurch. Wood has the dubious reputation of being a better pick when his variety – the potential extra pace, his willingness to bowl bouncers – is deemed to be of greater value. A less cheerful man than Wood might then point out “I only play on the flat ’uns”.There remains more uncertainty about the opening batsmen even though Alastair Cook will be equalling the record set by Allan Border when playing his 153rd consecutive Test. The only game Cook, who has never been dropped, has missed was through illness in Mumbai in 2006, which would have been his third Test.Both sides have slumped since the drawn 2016 series here. They were vying for first place in the rankings then now Pakistan are seventh, England fifth. Sarfraz Ahmed, a sparky captain behind the stumps, is leading a team that is rebuilding and missing one of their best bowlers, the leg-spinner Yasir Shah, because of injury.“That is why we have inducted Shadab Khan and Faheem Ashraf so we can have five bowlers”, said Sarfraz. “If we had Yasir we would have played six batsmen and a keeper with four bowlers”.Shadab, who is only 19, bowls leg-breaks, Faheem medium pace and both can be classed as all-rounders. Along with Imam-ul Haq, Inzamam’s nephew, they represent the new generation. But as with so many players in this match we have no real idea how effective they will be over the next five days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e51f76da4244630ec27f03aeae74453d91fcfd0/0_12_5408_3245/master/5408.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bbf84f2852c434a4c25c8f1c905d73b","title":"monaco grid girls sebastian vettel","story":"• Romain Grosjean says decision ‘was a good thing for women’• Formula One Management says women will still be seen on gridFormula One Management insists there will no ‘grid girls’ at this weekend’s Monaco Grand Prix, despite reports they were to make a return at the behest of the race organisers, Automobile Club de Monaco.F1 denies there was any conflict with Monaco and says that, while women will be seen on the grid, they are part of a promotional arrangement that had been discussed over time and agreed upon amicably. FOM said they could not be construed as ‘grid girls’ and that they would not be holding board numbers nor standing in front of cars. The issue remains isive among drivers, with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel saying he believed dispensing with ‘grid girls’ had been unnecessary.F1 decided to cease the practice this season, replacing them with ‘grid kids’– young karters selected by each race’s host nation. The commercial director, Sean Bratches, was unequivocal about the decision at the time, saying ‘grid girls’ were “at odds with modern-day societal norms. We don’t believe the practice is appropriate or relevant to Formula One.”Monaco has been seen as a direct challenge to the change in policy. However, a senior source at F1 management told the : “What is going to happen here is nothing new.” The women would be present as part of a long-standing commercial relationship between the race and watch manufacturer Tag Heuer and would only be taking pictures and showing messages from social media.The ‘grid kids’ will still be present and FOM insisted there had been no change in policy. Of the five races held this season four have had a promotional presence on the grid. In Melbourne it was children selected by the organisers to promote Australia in Bahrain, Gulf Air hostesses and stewards in China, men and women representing Heineken and in Spain, air hostesses from Emirates Airlines.FOM said it has been in discussions with promoters on the decision and with Monaco for at least eight weeks in what was described as a collaborative process. It was suggested similar promotional activity might occur at other meetings this season but F1 had no intention of returning to using ‘grid girls’.Vettel, who trails Lewis Hamilton by 17 points in the world championship, said he believed the original decision had been an overreaction. “I think all the women that took part as a grid girl in the past did it because they want to,” he said. “I’m sure if you ask any grid girl on Sunday if they’re happy to stand there, their answer would be: ‘yes’. I don’t think there’s anybody that forces them to do it. It speaks a little bit of our times that sometimes there’s a lot of noise for nothing.”Hamilton was non-committal. “I definitely don’t think that we should ever be supporting or pushing these women in general to feel uncomfortable and, if they are, then we shouldn’t do it. If they’re comfortable doing it, I don’t really know,” he said.Haas’s Romain Grosjean disagreed with Vettel and thought F1 was right to dispense with what is seen by many as an archaic tradition. “When it was removed I thought it was a good thing for women in the 21st century because they were not used as just a board holder,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5c9edd10142de8da8cdff3b3e18bc2fa290140/136_520_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e62089d8d78c158d10dae4b1a22f3e4","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

It’s a timely decision for a work that charts a clash of generations between Enid, who has moved from Jamaica to make a life in England and give her children the opportunities she never had, and her teenage daughters – born in the UK – who know nothing of the West Indies and see England as home.There is a line about an immigrant who is told his papers are not in order and who faces deportation. “That was written 30 years ago,” says Pinnock, wryly. Her frustration with the slow pace of change in general, and theatre in particular, is quietly but potently expressed.“We need to honour these journeys that are so old. Hundreds of years old. We must honour the sacrifices made by my parents, but also by our great, great, great, great grandparents. There is a link with this country that goes back generations,” she says, referring to slavery. “We deserve opportunities and access because our history and sense of being is part of this country’s history. It’s important not to forget that, because our history is one of being overlooked and silenced. It’s a continuing cycle and unless it’s broken there can be no progress. You can’t get away from the fact that we have been oppressed.”This production will mark the first time Leave Taking has been staged in London since 1997, and Pinnock’s only regret is that her mother is no longer around to see it. She died three years ago, and her last words to the daughter who had asked her mum endless questions about life in Jamaica when creating the play was to urge her to keep writing. “She had Alzheimer’s, but her saying I must keep going, keep writing, made me realise how important it was to her.”It’s important to Pinnock, too. She may once have been described by this paper as “the godmother of black British playwrights”, but despite accolades – including the George Devine award, and numerous well-received plays including Talking in Tongues and Mules at the Royal Court in the mid-1990s – she has been sorely neglected. In recent years, she has written shorts for the Bush and the Tricycle and had several radio plays broadcast, but her last major play in the theatre was One Under, more than a decade ago. “I felt forgotten. It’s painful. Writers are so powerless. We have a directors’ theatre, and if you are going to get plays seen, you have to have people in buildings championing you – and I didn’t have that.”Now she does, in Madani Younis, who is directing Leave Taking and has commissioned her to write a new play. She has also just finished a draft of Rockets in Blue Light, which she describes as “a conversation between the past and the present” set in contemporary London and the 19th-century capital just after the abolition of slavery. She remains fascinated by the craft of writing, which has led to a fruitful life in academia teaching playwrighting (“I learn as much as I teach,”), but while she knows she has achieved a great deal and that every hard-won gain should be celebrated, she is also acutely aware of how far there is to go for writers of colour.“I never imagined I’d ever have a play on. I grew up in Islington, in the poor bit, in a single-parent household and I was educated in the inner city. When I was told I was the first black woman to have a play on at the National Theatre, I thought, ‘That’s great, that’s progress.’ But then I thought, ‘Why did it take so long?’” We meet in the week in which Natasha Gordon’s debut play, Nine Night, opened at the National to rave reviews, but Gordon is still one of only a handful of black female writers, including debbie tucker green and Michaela Coel, who have had their work staged at the National. It’s hard for any young playwright to progress, but without a strong champion for writers of colour – Pinnock’s early work was supported by Jules Wright and the Women’s Playhouse Trust – the invisible barriers further lessen the opportunities. “You are always finding yourself cast as a beginner, always a young writer, even though I no longer was,” she says. “There was a sense for me and my peers, other black women writers, of feeling we weren’t allowed to grow up and progress – the feeling that I constantly had to prove myself over and over, and never getting to the point when people said, ‘You can do this.’” Pinnock argues it is not just the inidual who suffers, but the entire culture, leaving each new generation of black female writers to feel that nothing came before them. “Always feeling that you are the first is a lonely place to be,” she says.“If writers like me are denied a full career and the opportunity to reach our mature voice and fulfil our creative potential or tell our stories, it’s not just a censoring of that inidual but the censoring of an entire community. I feel this far more passionately than I ever did. You leave a trace of yourself as an unresolved history. It’s not enough that you now have black actors playing parts not necessarily written for them. There is a culture and history that should be told and seen on stage. I used to think we needed change to progress. Now I think we need a revolution. I was a shy kid, full of self-doubt when I wrote Leave Taking. I’m no longer that shy kid. I’ve got stuff to say. Let me say it.” She smiles. “What can be so dangerous about that?”• Leave Taking is at the Bush theatre, London, from 24 May.

What started off as something timely and necessary has given way to out-and-out torture porn. The first episode of the second series – which variously included muzzling, nooses, freezing, chaining, burning and graphic, closeup self-mutilation – was essentially one liquidised pig’s carcass away from becoming Saw III: The Series. The Handmaid’s Tale is now so relentlessly grim, so spectacularly, queasily bleak, that it overwhelms any point it might be trying to make. I would be much happier if I gave up on it now and never looked back. But guess what? I am still here, because it is a big important show, and that apparently overrides whether or not I like it.This is not to say that I am entirely hamstrung by apathy. There have been a couple of moments this year where I have victoriously given up on a programme. The first was Amazon’s The Crossing, billed as The New Lost, but which ended up being a honking great mess of too many ingredients hurled at the screen with a shrug. Yes, it might have taken five episodes for me to get there, but turning to my wife at the conclusion of another hour of nothingy bullshit and asking “Do you actually want to keep watching this?” felt like a moment of genuine triumph. Same goes for BBC One’s’s Hard Sun, which I bailed from two episodes in because I’m only human.There was a time when I would have persevered more aggressively with these programmes. I might have even made a sport of it, turning Westworld into a hate-watch endurance test, gleefully yelling at the TV whenever Jeffrey Wright murmurs another faux-intellectual phrase with all the pretend idiot profundity his stupid robot body can muster. But what is the point, when there are dozens of better shows I could be watching instead? Or a new show that I would otherwise never get around to watching? To hate-watch Westworld in 2018 would be even more self-indulgent than Westworld itself, if you can imagine such a thing. So here I am, trapped in purgatory. This is what I want to know: at what point do you summon the courage to give up on a show? Is there a tipping point, a moment of no return, where you can happily cash in your chips and move on from a series you no longer enjoy? If there is, for God’s sake tell me, because I would love nothing more than to stop watching Westworld and The Handmaid’s Tale. I won’t stop watching them, obviously, but I would love to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0573824a1e4de66481dfd5f9d18f931af9d3ec/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=863cfb3a6a204fd1b6951e279d4d6f59","title":"italys president invites populist coalition to form government","story":"Government formed by anti-establishment Five Star Movement and far-right League will be led by political novice Giuseppe ConteItaly’s president has given his blessing to the creation of a new populist government in Rome to be led by Giuseppe Conte, a political newcomer who will serve as Italy’s next prime minister.The ascension of a virtually unknown law professor to Palazzo Chigi, who will lead a government that has been cobbled together by two rival populist parties – the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League – represents an unprecedented development in one of Europe’s biggest economies. The decision by Sergio Mattarella, Italy’s president, to grant Conte a mandate to form a government, despite serious last-minute questions about the professor’s academic credentials, means he will now be given the power to choose ministers for a new government, which could be sworn in in coming days.“I am conscious of confirming Italy’s European and international position,” Conte said, in his first remarks to the nation on Wednesday evening. “I propose being the defence lawyer of the Italian people.” He made the short address in front of cameras in the presidential palace following a two-hour meeting with Mattarella.For weeks, it was uncertain whether the M5S’s Luigi Di Maio and the bombastic Matteo Salvini of the League, who is expected to take the role of interior minister, would be able to form a government. But the agreement of a shared agenda late last week, which included slashing taxes, increasing spending, and tougher laws on migration, followed by the decision to nominate Conte, has put the coalition on track to lead Italy, albeit with a slim parliamentary majority.Mattarella, the head of state, reportedly had doubts about Conte’s nomination but on Wednesday evening gave his blessing to the choice after both Di Maio and Salvini indicated that the professor, who has served as a lawyer for Di Maio, was the only candidate they could agree on. Mattarella has also voiced concern about the pair’s choice for finance minister, Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old Eurosceptic economist who has said that Italy’s entry into the eurozone was a mistake.The question dominating Italy now is how Conte, an enigmatic figure who is a member of the M5S but has never been seen as a political force within the anti-establishment party, will govern and what the rise of two non-traditional populist parties, who won the most votes in Italy’s 4 March election, will mean for the eurozone’s third largest economy. Markets have dropped sharply in recent days on concerns about whether the new government is on a collision course with Brussels over its spending plans, with Italy’s 10-year bond yield, a measure of the market’s concern, hitting a 14-month high.“The big issue is, how do you govern a country like Italy, an industrial giant, with a populist government, in a large democracy within the constraints of the eurozone?” said Sergio Fabbrini, director of the LUISS School of Government in Rome.“This is a laboratory in a way. Nobody knows what will happen, because this is a government without precedent, and the two parties of this government are virtually incompatible,” he added.The March election split Italy in two. The wealthy north sided with the League, a formerly secessionist party that campaigned on a xenophobic platform and has called for mass deportations of undocumented migrants. Poor regions in southern Italy voted for the M5S, which has called for a basic minimum income and is a proponent of so-called “direct democracy”, in which big decisions are put to online votes for members to decide.Experts say voters in both parties are united by anger towards Brussels and the view that economic constraints have held Italy back. Both parties also support building closer ties to Russia and have accused the EU of abandoning Italy in the face of the migrant crisis.Among the many unknowns were the leadership style of the new prime minister and whether the M5S-Lega coalition would be able to govern cohesively, he said. Italy was – not unlike the UK’s Brexit vote – possibly on the precipice of a sweeping change that would steer the country toward a far more antagonistic relationship with the EU, Orsina said. But the new government’s slim majority, and fiscal limits, made it more likely that sweeping change would be constrained, he added.“My expectation is that this thing cannot go on for a very long period of time. And of course there are very strong limits of what they can do because they have a lot of objective limits. So my expectation is that in a few months time someone will say, we pull out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba6300a048ed2765e4250060d712c8641f8b0c0/0_0_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c4976c4ee2a4a2a74d0eec78f8e1ef6","title":"parents of lawyer nominated as italys pm worry about political mudslinging","story":"Giuseppe Conte respected by friends and colleagues but his parents are a little worried The man nominated as Italy’s prime minister may be respected in the legal and academic realms but he is far-removed from the complex, messy world of Italian politics - something that is of mounting concern to his parents.“They are a little worried,” Vittoria Macchiarola, a childhood friend of his mother, told the . “He is already very important in his career, but look what happens when you get into politics: they throw mud.”There was a lot of mud thrown this week when Giuseppe Conte, 53, emerged as the surprise pick to lead a coalition of Luigi Di Maio’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League, headed up by Matteo Salvini.The lawyer and professor at the University of Florence was accused of embellishing his university studies on his CV, while reports emerged that he had supported Stamina, a discredited stem cell therapy invented by the disgraced former professor Davide Vannoni. Beppe Grillo, the comedian who founded M5S, slammed the claims as “malicious gossip”. Conte’s ex-wife, with whom he has a 10-year-old son, also leapt to his defence, saying accusations over his CV and Stamina were “rubbish”.Patrizia Giunti, a friend and colleague at the University of Florence, described Conte as “attentive, generous and very graceful”. “He’s much loved by his students,” Giunti told the .“We have been friends and colleagues for years and I have never heard him speak with a raised voice or get angry – he’s always soft, someone you mostly see with his mouth shut rather than open, but at the same time he is very effective.”Conte graduated from Rome’s Sapienza University in 1988 and now lives in the capital, where he runs a law firm. He is an expert in arbitration, particularly in the areas of civil and commercial law. Between 2012 and 2015 he served on the board of the Italian Space Agency.Conte came into contact with M5S in 2013, the year the party entered parliament for the first time, when he was asked to become a member of its council for administrative law. Di Maio, 31, had also earmarked him for the role of minister of public administration when he announced the party’s would-be cabinet lineup ahead of the elections. Conte told reporters in February that until 2013 he had been a left-wing voter.He is thought to be the mastermind behind Di Maio’s pledge to abolish 400 “useless laws” in order to cut Italy’s infamous red tape and free up the economy.A passionate fan of AS Roma, Conte is said to also be deeply spiritual and devoted to Saint Padre Pio.Italian media reported that he is also a fan of John F Kennedy, with his WhatsApp profile containing a quote from the assassinated US president: “Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3506197.1527106944!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mini heatwave is forecast for the rest of the week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople enjoy the warm weather in Merrion Square, Dublin, on Wednesday.

Photograph: Vincenzo PintoAFPGetty ImagesGiuseppe Conte has been given a formal mandate to become Italy’s next prime minister, heading a coalition of two populist parties that is set to take power amid fears that it will challenge Rome’s relationship with Europe.The 53-year-old civil lawyer and academic, received assent from Sergio Mattarella, Italy’s president, to become premier after fending off criticism about his lack of political experience and allegations that he embellished his curriculum vitae.The anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League sealed an alliance to govern the euro zone’s third-largest economy last week, after separately posting big gains in Italy’s March general election.Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star leader, and Matteo Salvini, the head of the League, identified the little-known Mr Conte as a compromise choice for prime minister this week after the two Eurosceptic parties struck a deal on a common platform of fiscal expansion, curbs on immigration and a pro-Kremlin foreign policy shift.Policymakers across EU capitals have grown increasingly concerned as Five Star and the League have grown ever closer to power. Investors have abruptly sold Italian assets – a trend that continued on Wednesday, with shares falling and bond yields rising in a reflection of economic uncertainty.However Eurosceptic politicians from across the continent have hailed the ascent of Five Star and the League – the first time one of the euro zone’s largest economies will be government by such avowedly anti-establishment parties.The mandate handed to Mr Conte on Wednesday night is not final. The law professor from the University of Florence – who hails from a small town in the southern province of Puglia – will have to return to Mr Mattarella with an acceptable slate of ministers to fill key cabinet positions.If Mr Mattarella does not agree with the names, a stand-off could ensue.Doubts have already surfaced over Five Star and the League’s proposal of Paolo Savona, an octogenarian Eurosceptic economist, for the key position of finance minister. Mr Mattarella had opposed the choice.Giancarlo Giorgetti, Mr Salvini’s top aide and a senior MP, is now the frontrunner to lead the finance ministry, according to one person familiar with the talks.“Mattarella may say – Conte is okay but I want my hand on the ministers,” said Lorenzo Pregliasco, co-founder of Youtrend, a political analysis firm.Once the cabinet is approved by the president, Mr Conte and the new government will be sworn in, with the final hurdle being a vote of confidence in both houses of parliament.After Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini proposed Mr Conte as prime minister on Monday, doubts about his suitability to the post flared up, raising questions about whether the populist duo would back away from their candidate.However Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini stuck by Mr Conte, putting pressure on Mr Mattarella to give him the mandate.Mr Di Maio said Mr Conte’s appointment sealed the beginning of a new political era – which he has described as Italy’s “Third Republic” – in which traditional ideologies have been supplanted by direct democracy.“We’re ready to go,” the League said in a statement.Analysts have questioned how effective Mr Conte will be as a political novice in a government where Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini – two young, vocal and ambitious leaders – would expect to make many decisions behind the scenes.“Five Star and the League made a deal on a platform but being in government means making hundreds of decisions every day,” said Mr Pregliasco. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505994.1527097742!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexiteers customs option could cost businesses up to 20bn a year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe  chief executive of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs told the House of Commons treasury committee there were about 200m consignments going into the EU in 2016, with a similar number coming from the EU, suggesting a cost of about £13bn. Photograph: Victoria JonesPA Wire\u0026nbsp The customs option favoured by Brexiteers in Theresa May’s cabinet could cost businesses up to £20 billion a year and take years to implement, the head of Britain’s Revenue and Customs has told MPs. Jon Thompson, chief executive of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), said the maximum facilitation model, or “max fac”, would require businesses to pay £32.50 for each customs declaration on goods moving between Britain and the EU.Mr Thompson told the House of Commons treasury committee that there were about 200 million consignments going into the EU in 2016, with a similar number coming from the EU, suggesting a cost of about £13 billion.“You’ve then got the question about what might be the requirements from the European Union on rules of origin. Is this cheese from Cheddar? It’s quite difficult to estimate that, but it would be reasonable to think that it is several billions pounds more. So you need to think about the highly streamlined customs arrangement costing businesses somewhere in the late tens of billions of pounds, somewhere between £17 billion and £20 billion. And the primary driver here is the fact that there are customs declarations,” he said.Mr Thompson said Ms May’s favoured option of a new customs partnership, which would keep Britain more closely aligned with the customs union, would cost about £700 million to set up but would prove net neutral for businesses. Brexiteers in the cabinet have been pressing the prime minister to opt for the “max fac” model, which would use technology to reduce friction at Britain’s borders.Downing Street dismissed Mr Thompson’s calculation as “speculation” but his evidence has raised the temperature in the debate over the future customs arrangement and the backstop to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Earlier on Wednesday, Brexit minister Suella Braverman admitted that MPs would have to vote on whether to approve Britain’s exit payment of £39 billion to the EU before a free trade agreement had been agreed.Ms Braverman, who was a leading Brexiteer on the Conservative backbenchers before becoming a minister, told the Brexit committee that the withdrawal agreement was not conditional on securing a satisfactory trade deal with the EU.“The withdrawal agreement text has been nearly finalised and agreed, that contains issues relating to the financial settlement. At present, it doesn’t contain aspects you talk about on conditionality. There is agreed a duty of good faith and that is an important aspect of the withdrawal agreement which obliges both parties to co-operate in a way, which means we are working constructively towards a future framework which is mutually beneficial and meets our objectives,” she said.“The prime minister has made very clear that the offer on the financial settlement is made as part of a broader package relating, and in the spirit of our future partnership the two will be connected when we vote in October.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503426.1526927646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers should hope for another election and soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU in January last year. Photograph: Thierry RogeEPAIt was a long, repetitive exercise that kept the British establishment waiting some of them willing it on, some of them concealing distaste. Bishop Michael Curry’s sermon at the royal wedding was a truer metaphor for Brexit than any journalist has coined these past two years.As the second anniversary of the referendum nears, there is more exasperated checking of watches left to go. A transition period from membership to non-membership will run until the end of 2020. The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country. Voters who were not exasperated by last year’s election might yet have their patience tested with a fifth major democratic event in as many years.

it is travelling in the wrong direction.It is the first time an interstellar space rock has been found to be permanently residing in the solar system. Earlier this year, a tumbling cigar-shaped object named \u0027Oumuamua\u0027, hit the headlines after flying into earth\u0027s galactic backyard, but it merely passed through and out again.But the new 1.8 mile wide rock - code-named 2015 BZ509 - appears to be a long-term resident, according to a study in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.The first clue that it was not a native of the solar system came from its retrograde orbit of the sun, the opposite the direction of travel taken by all the planets and almost every other object in our system.Scientists have concluded it survived by orbiting the sun exactly in step with Jupiter, but in the opposite directionDr Fathi Namouni, from the Cote d\u0027Azur Observatory in France, lead author of the study, said: How the asteroid came to move in this way while sharing Jupiter\u0027s orbit has until now been a mystery.If 2015 BZ509 were a native of our system, it should have had the same original direction as all of the other planets and asteroids, inherited from the cloud of gas and dust that formed them.Scientists have concluded it survived by orbiting the sun exactly in step with Jupiter, but in the opposite direction.Co-author Dr Helena Morais, from the Estadual Paulista University in Brazil, said: The close proximity of the stars, aided by the gravitational forces of the planets, help these systems attract, remove, and capture asteroids from one another.Computer simulations suggest that the asteroid made the jump to our solar system 4.5 billion years ago when the sun was part of a tightly packed star cluster.“That was completely unexpected...it means it is an alien to the solar system,” said Dr Namouni.Since asteroids and comets carry organic chemicals and water, the discovery could shed light on the origins of life on Earth, the scientists believe.Please review our commenting policyUK puffins may go the way of the dodo with fears of extinction in 50 yearsFederal prosecutors \u0026#39open criminal investigation into Harvey Weinstein\u0026#39 Childline must receive more funding to cope with demand from suicidal children say 130 MPs in open letter\u0026#39Local\u0026#39 meat may have travelled hundreds of miles, say groups calling for \u0026#39mobile abattoirs\u0026#39Airline pilot guilty of wife\u0026#39s murder after battering her to death with a saucepanPolice chief launches scathing attack on BBC over \u0026#39inaccurate\u0026#39 Manchester Arena terror documentaryTheresa May: \u0026#39Appalling\u0026#39 that Scottish Government put pressure on M\u0026ampSDonald Trump\u0026#39s lawyer \u0026#39paid $400,000 to arrange meeting with president of Ukraine\u0026#39Yulia Skripal says she is lucky to be alive in first appearance since \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39Duchess of Cornwall visits ITN to mark Five News anniversaryPiracy returns to Caribbean as Venezuela turmoil spurs rise in attacks on yachtsWhistleblower claims she was taped to a chair by colleagues in Scottish Government agencyBritain to demand money back after being frozen out of Galileo satellite projectScottish pupils \u0026#39not being offered a fair choice\u0026#39 of subjects under the SNPScottish deer found dead tangled in discarded fishing gearDonald Trump can\u0026#39t block people on Twitter, judge rulesAdmiral Nelson paedophile slurs forces auction house to withdraw telescope from saleComment: This doesn\u0026#39t have to be the death of the high street -

It\u0027s very clear that people are looking for more women.Ms Abrams, who has a law degree from Yale University and a masters from the University of Texas is considered a rising star within Democratic party\u0027s progressive faction. Hillary Clinton, whom Ms Abrams strongly backed in the presidential election, recorded a robocall for her ahead of Tuesday\u0027s race. A number of other prominent Democrats, including Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand, have backed the Georgia nominee.Ms Abrams, who was elected to Georgia\u0027s state House of Representative in 2006, has also written eight romantic novels under the pen name Selena Montgomery.Please review our commenting policyFederal prosecutors \u0026#39open criminal investigation into Harvey Weinstein\u0026#39 Childline must receive more funding to cope with demand from suicidal children say 130 MPs in open letter\u0026#39Local\u0026#39 meat may have travelled hundreds of miles, say groups calling for \u0026#39mobile abattoirs\u0026#39Airline pilot guilty of wife\u0026#39s murder after battering her to death with a saucepanPolice chief launches scathing attack on BBC over \u0026#39inaccurate\u0026#39 Manchester Arena terror documentaryTheresa May: \u0026#39Appalling\u0026#39 that Scottish Government put pressure on M\u0026ampSDonald Trump\u0026#39s lawyer \u0026#39paid $400,000 to arrange meeting with president of Ukraine\u0026#39Yulia Skripal says she is lucky to be alive in first appearance since \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39Duchess of Cornwall visits ITN to mark Five News anniversaryPiracy returns to Caribbean as Venezuela turmoil spurs rise in attacks on yachtsWhistleblower claims she was taped to a chair by colleagues in Scottish Government agencyBritain to demand money back after being frozen out of Galileo satellite projectScottish pupils \u0026#39not being offered a fair choice\u0026#39 of subjects under the SNPScottish deer found dead tangled in discarded fishing gearDonald Trump can\u0026#39t block people on Twitter, judge rulesAdmiral Nelson paedophile slurs forces auction house to withdraw telescope from saleComment: This doesn\u0026#39t have to be the death of the high street -

They also promised that Mr Ewing “would respond positively” if M\u0026ampS did so.Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Tory MSP, said at the time there was “not a person in the world who doesn’t know whisky is Scottish”.A separate briefing on Tesco strawberries recommended that “no formal action is taken at Cabinet Secretary level at present”, but asked whether Mr Ewing wanted a meeting “in the near future” with the supermarket.Both cases prompted a series of SNP supporters to write to Scottish ministers, with one questioning whether it was “an attempt by Westminster at a spot of brainwashing or is there something more sinister going on.”The Scottish Government said the documents showed it had raised public concerns “in a constructive manner”.Please review our commenting policyChildline must receive more funding to cope with demand from suicidal children say 130 MPs in open letter\u0026#39Local\u0026#39 meat may have travelled hundreds of miles, say groups calling for \u0026#39mobile abattoirs\u0026#39Airline pilot guilty of wife\u0026#39s murder after battering her to death with a saucepanPolice chief launches scathing attack on BBC over \u0026#39inaccurate\u0026#39 Manchester Arena terror documentaryDonald Trump\u0026#39s lawyer \u0026#39paid $400,000 to arrange meeting with president of Ukraine\u0026#39Yulia Skripal says she is lucky to be alive in first appearance since \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39Duchess of Cornwall visits ITN to mark Five News anniversaryPiracy returns to Caribbean as Venezuela turmoil spurs rise in attacks on yachtsWhistleblower claims she was taped to a chair by colleagues in Scottish Government agencyBritain to demand money back after being frozen out of Galileo satellite projectScottish pupils \u0026#39not being offered a fair choice\u0026#39 of subjects under the SNPScottish deer found dead tangled in discarded fishing gearDonald Trump can\u0026#39t block people on Twitter, judge rulesAdmiral Nelson paedophile slurs forces auction house to withdraw telescope from saleComment: This doesn\u0026#39t have to be the death of the high street - there\u0026#39s still life in the old dog yetCouncil bans families of suicide victims from leaving shrines at Beachy HeadPolitical novice confirmed as Italy\u0026#39s next prime ministerCare homes should prioritise wifi to make sure grandchildren come to visit says care minister Chelsea football club change name to \u0026#39women\u0026#39 as players deem \u0026#39ladies\u0026#39 old fashionedComment: Water is the UK\u0026#39s super-power - you won\u0026#39t catch me swapping my bath for a shower, thanks Sir James BevanWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/23/TELEMMGLPICT000164398145_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwSGx2L8KjiFCkP5mLgZe63M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tiny cross provides clue reunites renaissance masterpiece half","story":"The bottom panel, \u0026#39Descent into Limbo\u0026#39 is now thought to be part of a bigger painting worth millionsA tiny golden cross provided the clue that enabled art historians to piece together two halves of an oil painting by an Italian Renaissance master, in a discovery that has multiplied by 1,000 times the value of one of the pieces.One half of the oil painting, entitled “The Resurrection of Christ”, had been kept in a museum storeroom in Bergamo, northern Italy, for more than a century.It was considered to be a copy of the work of Renaissance painter Andrea Mantegna, or at best a painting produced by his son.But an Italian art historian noticed, at the bottom of the painting, the faint outline of a golden cross, and begun to suspect that it was not only a genuine Mantegna but part of a larger painting.The top panel is the painting newly attributed to the Italian artist Andrea Mantegna—\u0026#39The Resurrection of Christ.\u0026#39 The bottom panel is a long-recognised Mantegna painting called \u0026#39Descent Into Limbo\u0026#39Giovanni Valagussa, the museum’s curator, discovered that the barely-visible cross at the base of the painting matched a staff held by a figure in an acknowledged Mantegna work, “Descent into Limbo”, completed in 1493.That work sold to a private buyer at Sotheby’s in New York in 2003 for more than $28 million.Further backing up his hunch, Prof Valagussa noticed that a rocky arch in the Resurrection painting matched stonework and the interior of a cave in the Limbo painting.He realised that the two had once been part of a single work which had been cut in two, as sometimes happened to paintings in the Renaissance era.“This has been a compelling story of attribution, which retraced all the hypotheses and work of past centuries,” said Prof Valagussa. “It restores to the world of culture a great masterpiece. It is the most important discovery relating to Mantegna in 30 years.”The linking of the two works means that the top Resurrection panel, newly attributed to Mantegna, is likely to be worth $28-$30 million.\u0026#39The Resurrection of Christ\u0026#39 spent more than a century in a storeroom in a museum in northern Italy. The golden cross, circled, was the clue that led to the painting being reunited with its other halfWhile kept in storage in Bergamo’s Accademia di Carrara, it had been insured for €20,000-30,000 – meaning that it is now worth about 1,000 times more than was previously thought.The new attribution has been confirmed by Dr Keith Christiansen of the politan Museum of Art in New York, the world’s foremost expert on Mantegna.He described the Resurrection painting as “an absolutely top-quality work by one of the defining artists of the early Renaissance.”Italian experts are now restoring the newly-attributed panel, removing centuries of grime and bringing out the original colours of the painting, which shows Roman soldiers looking astounded by Christ’s resurrection.Whether the two pieces will ever be reunited in a gallery or museum remains uncertain – the private buyer of the lower, Limbo half is said to be reluctant to allow it out of his hands.“We’d love to bring the two pieces together after all these centuries of separation and organise an exhibition. We’re hoping to trace the collector,” said Prof Valagussa.Mantegna was born around 1431 in the village of Isola di Carturo near Padua in northern Italy.At the age of 10 he was apprenticed to a painter, Francesco Squarcione, who later adopted him.He then established his own studio and spent much of his life in the city of Mantua, where he died in 1506.  Please review our commenting policyFederal prosecutors \u0026#39open criminal investigation into Harvey Weinstein\u0026#39 Childline must receive more funding to cope with demand from suicidal children say 130 MPs in open letter\u0026#39Local\u0026#39 meat may have travelled hundreds of miles, say groups calling for \u0026#39mobile abattoirs\u0026#39Airline pilot guilty of wife\u0026#39s murder after battering her to death with a saucepanPolice chief launches scathing attack on BBC over \u0026#39inaccurate\u0026#39 Manchester Arena terror documentaryTheresa May: \u0026#39Appalling\u0026#39 that Scottish Government put pressure on M\u0026ampSDonald Trump\u0026#39s lawyer \u0026#39paid $400,000 to arrange meeting with president of Ukraine\u0026#39Yulia Skripal says she is lucky to be alive in first appearance since \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39Duchess of Cornwall visits ITN to mark Five News anniversaryPiracy returns to Caribbean as Venezuela turmoil spurs rise in attacks on yachtsWhistleblower claims she was taped to a chair by colleagues in Scottish Government agencyBritain to demand money back after being frozen out of Galileo satellite projectScottish pupils \u0026#39not being offered a fair choice\u0026#39 of subjects under the SNPScottish deer found dead tangled in discarded fishing gearDonald Trump can\u0026#39t block people on Twitter, judge rulesAdmiral Nelson paedophile slurs forces auction house to withdraw telescope from saleComment: This doesn\u0026#39t have to be the death of the high street - there\u0026#39s still life in the old dog yetCouncil bans families of suicide victims from leaving shrines at Beachy HeadPolitical novice confirmed as Italy\u0026#39s next prime ministerCare homes should prioritise wifi to make sure grandchildren come to visit says care minister We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"whistleblower claims taped chair colleagues scottish government","story":"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick was allegedly taped to a chair by colelaguesA whistleblower who complained of a racist and misogynistic culture in a Scottish Government agency claims she was taped to a chair and gagged by two male colleagues.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick said the restraint took place during years of bullying and harassment at Marine Scotland\u0027s Scrabster office.The fisheries officer has taken her case to an employment tribunal and claims she was taped up as a warning to keep quiet.The photograph, said to have been taken by one of the two men allegedly responsible, was obtained by BBC Scotland.Ms Fitzpatrick, 49, a Canadian national, said the incident happened in 2010 as a result of her speaking out about a threatening and misogynistic culture at the quango’s office in Scrabster, on the north coast of Scotland.In evidence to the tribunal, she said that one of the men told her: This is what you get when you speak out against the boys.”DeeAnn Fitzpatrick has been giving evidence at a tribunalHowever, the employment tribunal in Aberdeen is unable to consider the restraint incident as it occurred more than three years before the case was brought.The Scottish Government is responsible for the agency which acts as the watchdog for the fisheries and aquaculture industries.Rhoda Grant, a Labour MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said the photograph was “horrific”, adding: “I’m kind of speechless.“In some of my dealings with DeeAnn it\u0027s very clear that there is a culture in that office that people can get away with what they say and what they do. It seems to me that it\u0027s out of control.”In an email from a manager after Ms Fitzpatrick raised the alleged incident, it was claimed that it was a case of “boys just being boys”.Ms Fitzpatrick claimed that over a period of almost 10 years she had been subjected to behaviour including being mocked about having a miscarriage, being told certain staff didn\u0027t want a foreign woman”, and subjected to racist language.One of the men allegedly involved, who has left the agency, told the corporation: “These are false allegations. I can\u0027t remember the event you mention, but if it did happen, it would have been office banter. Just a craic. Certainly nothing to do with abuse.”Ms Fitzpatrick, of Janetstown, near Thurso, is understood to have been signed off from work since her father died in November 2016.She is understood to be facing a disciplinary hearing from her employers at the end of May, over charges of being overzealous in her job and rude to clients.A spokesman for the government said it had “clear standards of behaviour which apply to all staff”, adding: Any concerns raised by staff are taken seriously and investigated fully.” It also said that in addition to the ongoing tribunal there were internal procedures underway, and it would be wrong to pre-empt the outcome.Law and orderFederal prosecutors \u0026#39open criminal investigation into Harvey Weinstein\u0026#39 Childline must receive more funding to cope with demand from suicidal children say 130 MPs in open letter\u0026#39Local\u0026#39 meat may have travelled hundreds of miles, say groups calling for \u0026#39mobile abattoirs\u0026#39Airline pilot guilty of wife\u0026#39s murder after battering her to death with a saucepanPolice chief launches scathing attack on BBC over \u0026#39inaccurate\u0026#39 Manchester Arena terror documentaryTheresa May: \u0026#39Appalling\u0026#39 that Scottish Government put pressure on M\u0026ampSDonald Trump\u0026#39s lawyer \u0026#39paid $400,000 to arrange meeting with president of Ukraine\u0026#39Yulia Skripal says she is lucky to be alive in first appearance since \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39Duchess of Cornwall visits ITN to mark Five News anniversaryPiracy returns to Caribbean as Venezuela turmoil spurs rise in attacks on yachtsBritain to demand money back after being frozen out of Galileo satellite projectScottish pupils \u0026#39not being offered a fair choice\u0026#39 of subjects under the SNPScottish deer found dead tangled in discarded fishing gearDonald Trump can\u0026#39t block people on Twitter, judge rulesAdmiral Nelson paedophile slurs forces auction house to withdraw telescope from saleComment: This doesn\u0026#39t have to be the death of the high street - there\u0026#39s still life in the old dog yetCouncil bans families of suicide victims from leaving shrines at Beachy HeadPolitical novice confirmed as Italy\u0026#39s next prime ministerCare homes should prioritise wifi to make sure grandchildren come to visit says care minister Chelsea football club change name to \u0026#39women\u0026#39 as players deem \u0026#39ladies\u0026#39 old fashionedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"ms marks spencer ftse 100 index share price store closures profits down","story":"Falling out would be \u0027hugely symbolic\u0027, says analyst\u0026nbspMarks and Spencer could be on the verge of dropping out of the\u0026nbspFTSE 100 for the first time since the UK’s index of leading shares was created in 1984.The company’s share price has tumbled in recent months, leading it to the bottom of the FTSE 100, which is made up of the largest publicly listed companies.The retailer could fall out of the index next Tuesday, if its own share price falls further or if a number of other smaller companies hovering just below the top 100 increase in value.

Secretary\u0026nbspDeVos\u0026nbspis once again wrong’Civil rights groups have heavily criticised US education secretary Betsy DeVos for saying that schools can decide whether to report undocumented students to immigration enforcement officials. They said her statements conflict with the law and could raise fears among immigrant students.Ms DeVos’s answers came during testimony before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. New York Democrat Adriano Espaillat, himself an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who was at one time undocumented, pressed the secretary for her positions on immigration enforcement.“Inside the school,” Mr Espaillat asked, “if a principal or a teacher finds out that a certain child is undocumented, or his or her family members are undocumented, do you feel that the principal or teacher is responsible to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to have that family reported?”M DeVos replied:“Sir, I think that’s a school decision. That’s a local community decision. And again, I refer to the fact that we have laws and we also are compassionate, and I urge this body to do its job and address or clarify where there is confusion around this.”Not so, say civil rights groups. The Supreme Court made clear in Plyler v. Doe that public schools have a constitutional obligation to provide schooling for children, regardless of immigration status. That means schools also cannot enforce measures that would deter undocumented children from registering. They cannot ask about immigration status and according to the American Civil Liberties Union, they cannot report students or their families to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.“Let’s be clear: Any school that reports a child to ICE would violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court has made clear that every child in America has a right to a basic education, regardless of immigration status,” Lorella Praeli, the ACLU’s director of immigration policy and campaigns, said in a statement. “Secretary DeVos is once again wrong.”The Supreme Court ruling has not prevented some states from attempting to bar undocumented children from their schools. California voters in 1994 passed Proposition 187, which required schools to kick out undocumented students and to report students they suspected of being undocumented to federal authorities, but the law was struck down in federal court.Alabama in 2011 passed a measure requiring school districts to ask all students about their immigration status and report their findings to the state. The federal government and others challenged the law, saying it violated Plyler because it preceded an uptick in absenteeism among Latino students. A federal appellate court blocked its implementation two years later.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople protest outisde the Tamil Nadu House after at least 10 people were killed when police fired on protesters seeking closure of plant on environmental grounds in town of Thoothukudi in southern state of Tamil Nadu, in New Delhi.People demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

Under the Plyler decision, “Any public school or school district that denies an education to any undocumented child – whether by refusing to enroll, by limiting access to the programs and benefits provided to other students, or by reporting a child to ICE – has violated the United States Constitution.”Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, declared the matter “settled constitutional law”.“Betsy DeVos should know better, and to suggest otherwise only serves to frighten children,” Ms Eskelsen García said.Asked to respond to the backlash, Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said: Ms DeVos has repeatedly said that DACA students have the right to a K-12 education, as ruled on by the Supreme Court”. Ms Hill used the acronym for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides two-year, renewable work permits and deportation protections for about 690,000 “dreamers,” undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children.“She has tremendous compassion for DACA students and has said repeatedly she hopes that Congress would do its job and give these students the certainty they deserve,” Ms Hill said.The exchange comes as the immigration debate reaches a fever pitch, with President Trump threatening to jail leaders of sanctuary cities and an increase in immigration enforcement. In some places, schools have also reassured community members that they will not permit immigration agents on school grounds, nor will they turn student records over to the immigration agency without a subpoena.Historically, immigration agents have avoided schools.

The Pew Research Center estimates 3.9 million schoolchildren had an unauthorized immigrant parent in 2014 – or 7.3 percent of all schoolchildren. About 725,000 of those children were unauthorized immigrants.Mr Espaillat also grilled Ms DeVos about accounts of immigration agents arresting parents near schools. DeVos declined to say whether she supported the Trump administration’s enforcement actions.“We are a nation of laws and a nation of compassionate people,” Ms DeVos said. “I think it’s important that we follow the laws of the land, and if it’s important that laws be changed, this body can do so.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The agency emailed a notice to all US citizens in China about the employee at the consulate in Guangzhou who said there were “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure”. It advised Americans to contact medical professionals if they experience any “unusual auditory or sensory of phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises”. The incident harkens back to when nearly two dozen US employees working in Havana had sought medical treatment between December 2016 to May 2017 for headaches, ear pain, dizziness, and hearing issues. Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person. Some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported.A subsequent FBI investigation did not reveal evidence of a “sonic attack”. However, the reports put the largest strain on US-Cuba relations since former president Barack Obama forged closer ties in 2014. Recording of \u0027sonic weapon attack\u0027 on US diplomats in Cuba releasedBetween September and October 2017, US President Donald Trump expelled 17 Cuban diplomats from the US, ordered US staff in Havana to come back, and issued a travel warning to the small, island nation - all implying the administration believed Cuba had some role in the mysterious illnesses of the diplomats. Cuba, for its part, denied any wrongdoing and attributed the illnesses to a possible psychological cause. The State Department said it is not aware of any similar situations in China and did not identify the person who reported the systems or when that information was relayed to the agency.

The Home Office remains tight-lipped and government spokesmen have offered little of substance. Visa applications are “rigorous and proper”, Downing Street has suggested, while a security minister has noted that “more cases over the next few weeks could be on their way”. Many questions remain – has Mr Abramovich been denied a visa? If so, on what grounds? Is this a demonstration of muscle before the inevitable new documents are issued? Or has this been directed by Downing Street?Roman Abramovich must reveal finances to get back into the UKAnd this, says the Russian exile businessman Vladimir Ashurkov, is highly problematic. “If the British are trying to send out a message, it is a really weak one,” he says. “Mr Abramovich is one of richest men in Britain, owns a football club, and is a prominent public figure. The public deserves to know what the government really thinks about him.” Mr Abramovich has held British visas for several years. But the rules on his Tier 1 investor visa were tightened in 2015, after his last renewal. Applicants now have to show that £2m of the investments they make into the UK are from legal sources.The oligarch is unlikely to have much problem in doing this, if that is indeed the only hurdle he has to leap. But whatever the British decision actually is, it suffers for being non-transparent, says the author and security expert Mark Galeotti. It would be one thing if he was targetted for being a Russian oligarch, and quite another if the government was acting on intelligence.“If they have some specific information about Abramovich, they should make it public, so the punishment actually has some deterrent effect,” he says. It is also unclear whether the British government decided to move against Mr Abramovich because of coincidence – a visa renewal so soon after Skripal – or due to his proximity to power. Russia warns UK it is \u0027playing with fire and will be sorry\u0027 over Salisbury spy poisoningMr Abramovich is considered to be very close to the Kremlin, but he is not unique in that regard, and is not quite in Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.But the oligarch is also considered a reliable go-to and source of finance for many projects, says Valery Solovei, Professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. And that link has been enough for Moscow to draw its own conclusions. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople protest outisde the Tamil Nadu House after at least 10 people were killed when police fired on protesters seeking closure of plant on environmental grounds in town of Thoothukudi in southern state of Tamil Nadu, in New Delhi.People demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

By attacking Russia’s vulnerabilities – the nexus of money and politics – the conflict with Britain has become not only serious, but also highly personal. “The mood in the Kremlin is that they want to have nothing more with this British government,” he says. “There is no way back for Theresa May or Boris Johnson as far as Moscow is concerned they are waiting for the next elections.” Why it’s a big problem for Putin if the Balkan countries enter the EUThe British moves have been heavily ridiculed in state propaganda. News programmes have suggested the UK is out to punish Russia, whatever the grounds, with Theresa May portrayed as the main bogeywoman. “The average Russian isn’t going to shed tears over poor oligarchs, but the lack of clear reasons has allowed the Kremlin can put whatever spin they want on it,” says Mr Galeotti. “But the rich Russians who once thought London was open to them have begun will now look to find somewhere to go. It doesn’t modify behaviour at all.”  Following tightened legislation and warnings of an impending crackdown, hundreds of millions of pounds of Russian cash has already left British shores over recent months. The trend looks set to continue. “The UK was once considered a safe haven for Russians, but no more,” says Mr Solovei. “Well-off Russians have begun to look for other places to put their cash, nervous about the possibility of new and unpredictable sanctions.” John Woodcock disagrees over comment Jeremy Corbyn was ‘a robust critic of the Russian governmentt for more than 20 years’A parliamentary report published on Monday raised the prospect of a further strengthening of the sanctions regime against Russia. It claimed “dirty money” was in danger of undermining the reputation of the City of London. In its most radical sections, it suggested coordinated moves to make it harder for Russia to raise money on the markets. One of the people interviewed for that report, Mr Ashurkov, said that it is unlikely the UK would gain broad agreement for a move that would likely enrage Moscow further. “That, at present, seems an unwarranted step,” he said. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And the politicians realise the scaremongering isn\u0026rsquot working.\u0026ldquoOf course Britain can be successful after Brexit, we were before and we will be again.When asked whether this signalled the failure of Project Fear, Mr Morehouse said: \u0026ldquoI would hope so. People have woken up to the fact they have been lied to by Remoaners, scaremongering, this that and the other.\u0026ldquoQuite obviously, if we get out, if we\u0026rsquore not thrashed by the House of Lords, we will be successful.Brexit news: Despite Project Fear, the British public believe Brexit Britain will not sufferThe poll also revealed, while 32 per cent of respondents said they feared jobs would move from the UK to the EU, 33 per cent disagreed. The remaining 35 per cent were uncertain.There was more good news for Mrs May when considering the fate of the UK-based workforce itself. When asked whether British workers will become \u0026ldquoless talented and skilled after Brexit, 39 per cent of respondents disagreed while just 31 per cent agreed.And while 35 per cent of people agreed they were \u0026ldquoworried about the lack of up-skilling of the UK workforce after Brexit, 36 per cent said they were unsure while a further 29 per cent said they did not agree.Outside of London\u0026rsquos Remain bubble, confidence in the UK\u0026rsquos economic future was particularly high.When asked \u0026ldquodo you believe high-skilled jobs will leave the UK for the EU?, 37 per cent of respondents in London said yes.This figure shrunk to 33 per cent in Manchester, 32 per cent in Glasgow, 29 per cent in Newcastle and just 19 per cent in Birmingham - where Brexiteers outnumbered Remainers in June 2016\u0026rsquos in-out referendum.The poll also showed a difference of opinions when broken down by gender. Women, for the large part, appeared more positive about the future of Britain\u0026rsquos economy than men.Just 11 per cent of women, compared to 17 per cent of men, said they were considering leaving the UK after Brexit. And only 16 per cent of women, compared to 25 per cent of men, said they considered the UK private sector less attractive after Brexit."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Scottish-independence-supporters-963879.jpg","title":"scottish independence nicola sturgeon snp indyref2","story":"Ms Sturgeon has laid out plans for her summer offensive despite being warned Scots have no appetite for Indyref2.A 354-page report, Scotland \u0026ndash The New Case for Optimism: A Strategy for Inter-generational Economic Renaissance, examines growth, public finances and currency in an independent Scotland.Each section of the report will be discussed by SNP National Assemblies throughout the summer.But the campaign is already mired in controversy after Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos economy secretary Keith Brown suggested Scotland could ditch the pound as its currency.Scottish independence supporters                Tory MP says Sturgeon will use ANYTHING to break Britain apart                PM must admit DEFEAT on Brexit Bill in Scotland or risk breaking up UKAppearing in front of Holyrood\u0026rsquos economy committee, Mr Brown was asked by Conservative MSP Dean Lockhart to confirm whether the new Scottish National Investment Bank would use sterling over the next 10 to 15 years.Mr Brown said the decision would not be for him to make.He said: \u0026ldquoI think that would be the person that\u0026rsquos got the job of trying to establish certainty going forward to a 15-year period \u0026ndash nobody else can do that.\u0026ldquoWho knows what changes are going to happen over the course of that time?

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit negotiators should remember this.An exciting new era awaits the happy couple, and us, as a truly global Great Britain.SHADOW Chancellor John McDonnell is a sinister politician who would wreck Britain’s finances.Yesterday he outlined how he wants to overthrow capitalism and introduce socialism.He and Jeremy Corbyn would take us down a very dark path. Just look at once-rich Venezuela, where socialism resulted in the poor starving to death and there being no medicine for the sick.Madly, McDonnell yesterday claimed the South American country’s problem was that it was not socialist enough. He also said he wanted a “zero- tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism, yet defended Labour’s appointment of Martha Osamor to the House of Lords.That’s the same Martha Osamor who claimed the party’s anti-Semitism row was manufactured as “a tool to intimidate activists on the Left”.We wouldn’t expect anything less from McDonnell, a man who glorified the IRA, described London rioters as “the best of our movement” and joked about lynching a Tory minister.There are rumours the Government is insanely considering calling a snap election — risking handing this scary clown the keys to the country finances.The Tories would not just be gambling their future, but Britain’s.CULTURE Secretary Matt Hancock is right to get tough with the social media giants.For far too long Facebook and Google have shown no concern for the youngsters using their sites.Mr Hancock invited 14 of the internet giants to a consultation.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring.

I’ve not sold it and that’s all I’m saying.”A man, believed to be her father, also answered the door but declined to comment.Claire apparently sold off the thoughtful gift after being one of the 1,200 non-VIP­ members of the public invited to share in Meghan and Harry’s big day outside St Georges Chapel on Saturday.The Daily Mail reported she had shared her excitement about the big day, reportedly tweeting: I got to watch the royal wedding right outside Windsor Castle in this amazing setting. Such an amazing day #Golden ticket #Royal connections.But the excitement apparently didnt last long as her complimentary goodie bag was posted on eBay hours later where it eventually went for £21,400.The hessian bags, inscribed with the couples initials, contained a welcome letter, commemorative chocolate coin, bottled Windsor Castle water, fridge magnet, official order of service and a tin of shortbread.Claire received more than 80 bids on her listing - with one bid of £60,000 retracted - before managing to sell it.The young woman is not believed to have received the cash yet.According to eBay rules, bids can only be retracted within one hour if there is less than 12 hours in the auction to go. The decision to allow a bid to be cancelled is up to the seller.But Claire isnt the only opportunist to sell off the commemorative bag, with a number of other bags put up for sale just hours after the wedding that saw everyone from the Queen to the Clooneys attend.One seller called Chrisofwilliams, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, stands to make more than £40,000 after putting his commemorative bag on eBay.The gift was initially listed for 99p on Sunday, with the seller saying: Buy a piece of history and memorabilia to celebrate a momentous special day for Britain’s and the royal family.I am selling my limited Goody bag for guests of Royal wedding of Meghan and Harry 19th May 2018.Official bag with full contents containing commemorative chocolate coin unopened sealed and in original condition, labelled spring water bottle unopened and sealed in original condition: royal wedding fridge magnet unopened in original packaging, the castle spectator badge and a tub of ‘handbag shortbread’ unopened as well as a Marriage order of service booklet and a 20% off voucher of middle ward shop in Windsor castle.Don’t miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history.”The hessian gift bag was given to the 2,640 guests who were invited to the wedding of the year.But many saw the monetary value in flogging off the bag, selling it online.So what does the bag actually contain? - Bottle of Windsor Castle Still Spring Water 500mL- Harry and Meghan Traditiaionl Handbag Shortbread Biscuits- Royal Wedding 2018 Belgian Milk Chocolate Coin 90g- Royal Wedding Commemorative Magnet- Voucher for royalcollectionshopAnother online listing has reached £420 while another hit £411.One of of the listings, the seller declared proudly: “At the wedding today I received this wonderful gift bag for guests.”And the post promised: “I forgot to mention all money raised will go to charity.”Another seller has even been trying to flog PDFs of the Royal Wedding order of service - for £5 each.As the non-VIP guests departed on Saturday the wedding reception turned into an ­outrageous party with a very royal dance-off and “beer pong” games. The Sun can reveal that chat-show superstar James Corden — who was compering the event — instigated an extraordinary dance routine which featured Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry.The royal couple chose I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the fun-filled, early-hours wedding bash.Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36 — now the Duke and ­Duchess of Sussex — let their hair down to the hit by Whitney Houston at Frogmore House, Windsor, where telly’s Corden hosted dinner and fireworks for 200 guests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like. If Theresa May formed a position fully honouring the result, and told the EU to like it or lump it, the unease would end overnight.Our economy would take off like a rocket.IT is disgraceful that Google is revealing rape victims’ names via the “autocomplete” function on its searches.

Fine words are well known for not buttering parsnips, and we are not getting our parsnips buttered at the moment.”His withering attack continued: “In terms of these negotiations, particularly as they’re led by someone who backed Remain, trust is very important. And it’s very important that the Government maintains faith with those who voted leave.To go into the negotiations to say to Mr Barnier, We will kowtow before you in every way you possibly want if we cannot get everything ready by the due date, encourages him to say, Just kowtow, Im quite happy.No10 hit back to say Mrs May making “good progress” on leaving the EU in an attempt to play down the latest outbreak of government civil war over Brexit. Last night Mrs May was backed by Boris Johnson who said she was the “custodian” of Brexit.Speaking in Argentina, the Foreign Secretary said: “The Prime Minister is the custodian of the plan, which is to come out of the customs union, out of the single market and to get on with it, to get on with that project with all convenient speed -- and that is what we are going to do.He added: “What people like Argentina, Peru, Chile, outward, free-trading countries, what they want to hear from us is that we are getting on with it with confidence and brio and zap and dynamism.”In a further embarrassment for the Govt its own immigration minister admitted she had never read the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland.The Home Office minister with responsibility for the Irish border Caroline Nokes said she was “probably giving birth” when it was signed 20 years ago.The pro-EU Best for Britain campaign hit back: “It seems that ministers have no idea of history or even policy.“It is scandalous that ministers can deliver answers like this.

Its two engines and generators are functioning, said Abdul-Zahra Abdul-Mahdi Saleh, its captain. It only needs periodic maintenance.But authorities have now decided to moor it permanently as a hotel and recreation facility for the southern ports pilots, many of whom live in distant cities.The port needs the boat to be a station where sea pilots can rest, said Basra port spokesman Anmar al-Safi.Built by a Danish shipyard while Iraq was at war with Iran, the yacht was passed on to Saudi Arabia - then a Saddam ally - to protect it from air strikes on Basra.The kingdom, which fell out with Saddam after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, then handed the vessel over to Jordan.Its subsequent movements were unclear until Iraq tracked it down in the French resort of Nice, where a court seized it and sent it home.While the Basrah Breeze survived the turmoil of Saddams decline and demise, its sister ship al-Mansur - which he also never boarded - suffered a different fate, sinking in the Shatt al-Arab waterway that passes through Basra after it was hit by US planes and then stripped bare in the chaotic aftermath of his overthrow.Saddam had ordered it in 2003 to leave Umm Qasr, Iraqs biggest port outside Basra, where it had been moored, to Basra in a vain attempt to avoid air strikes.I told the captain of the yacht, who was a brigadier, to get rid of the military uniforms of the crew, weapons and munitions and pose as civilian ship in case it is caught by the American warships, said Ali Hussein, a port pilot who guided the yacht at the time.As regards Basrah Breeze, Basra museum has not given up hope of persuading the port to allow it to dock the vessel next to its exhibition halls in one of Saddams former palaces overlooking the Shatt al-Arab.Future generations could see how a dictator lived, said Jawad Abdul Kadhim, the museums deputy director."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407467154-e1527071508182.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"male labour activist suspended after he tries to become womens officer because hes female one day a week","story":"David Lewis said that he feels like a man six days a week, but becomes a woman on the other day.He stood to be the Labour womens officer in Basingstoke in a bid to highlight the partys policy which allows members to define their own gender.But now party chiefs have suspended him and launched an investigation into claims hes undermining Labour.Rules which were confirmed by the partys executive committee last night state women-only positions are open to anyone who self-identifies as female.Mr Lewis told the Spectator he intended to highlight what this policy means, what happens when you say that someones gender depends only on what they say and nothing else.He added: Anyone elses criticism or questions about my gender identity are just not relevant to the Labour party at the moment, given the current policy. If I say Im a woman, Im a woman.But he insisted he didnt actually want to win the contest to become womens officer.After he was suspended, a Labour spokesman said: The Labour party is committed to upholding the principle of affirmative action for women.Anyone attempting to breach Labour party rules and subvert the intention of all-women shortlists, women’s officers or minimum quotas for women will be dealt with via our established safeguards, selection procedures and disciplinary measures.Activists say trans people shouldnt have to get legal recognition to be able to identify as a particular gender within Labour.But some feminists claim that undermines the point of women-only positions because it allows men to pretend to be female."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000289419229.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"2464\" width=\"3960","title":"china population controls scrapped babies one child policy","story":"Communist Party officials are reportedly on the verge of relaxing government rules surrounding the number of children a family can have.Authorities are concerned that a dwindling workforce will not be able to support Chinas ageing population as it tops 1.38billion  people — a fifth of the world total.Government research is expected to recommend abandoning the policy, which was first introduced in 1979.Chinas then leader Deng Xiaoping wanted to control the countrys population boom, which was sparked by predecessor Chairman Maos Great Leap Forward.The Great Leap saw rapid industrialisation in the late fifties and early sixties but lead to widespread famine as the the country struggled to feed its fast-growing population.Most urban couples were limited to one child while rural couples could have two if their firstborn was a girl.Women were encouraged to take long-term contraception or even be permanently sterilised after their first child.Refusal could see them lose their government job and forfeit their childs education and healthcare.The one-child policy also contributed to a stark gender imbalance, with 32.66 million more males than females at the end of 2017.News agency Bloomberg reported on Monday that Chinas State Council, or cabinet, may make a decision on the policy as early as later this year.The number of births in China fell by 3.5 percent to 17.23 million last year — despite earlier moves to relax its policy.In 2015 couples were freely allowed to have a second child for the first time, leading to a brief spike in the birth rate of 8 per cent.Demographer Liang Zhongtang told the Times: I don’t think our government will make a fuss about abolishing the birth-planning policy.

up by four million from 2010 – a number which locals feel is overwhelming the resident population of just over one million."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000384877157.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour chairmans aide says theresa may would look better with a noose around her neck","story":"Paul Robertson has kept his job as an assistant to Ian Lavery despite his vile comments about the PM.The parliamentary aide posted a photo of Mrs May on his Facebook page over the weekend, blasting her for appointing new Tory peers, MailOnline reported.A friend then said to Mr Robertson: Do you have to keep putting pictures up of that ugly harridan?He replied: She would look better with a noose around her neck.After the comments came to light today, Mr Robertson issued a grovelling apology as Labour bosses gave him a public rebuke.The aide said: I apologise unreservedly for making this highly inappropriate and offensive comment over the weekend, which I have now deleted.I also apologise to Mr Lavery for having caused embarrassment to his office.A spokesman for Mr Lavery said: This comment is wholly unacceptable.All those working for the Labour party or for Members of Parliament have a particular responsibility to ensure the highest possible standards of behaviour and this has been reiterated to all of Mr Laverys staff.Tory MP James Cleverly raged: Once again we see violent language towards Conservative women from the very top of the Labour party.Just yesterday a local Labour chief was suspended for saying that Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry is too old to be an ISIS sex slave."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000004065635.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"30000 brits havent been told theyre about to lose a key benefit worth 1650 a year","story":"Homeowners who get cash from the Government to help with the cost of their mortgage are having the benefit withdrawn as a result of a new law change.But more than a quarter of those affected havent been directly contacted to let them know theyll lose £1,650 a year on averageMinisters were today blasted for the cack-handed rollout of the change to Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) amidst warnings the blunders could leave people homeless.The handout is currently paid to more than 100,000 households, with each one getting an average of £138 per month.It is available to homeowners who are receiving certain benefits such as Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance or Pension Credit.But a new law which came into effect this week means that the benefit is now a loan which has to be repaid.All of the 104,000 SMI claimants are supposed to have received a letter telling them about the change, and asking whether they want to accept the loan or stop receiving cash altogether.But only three quarters have had a phone call with outsourcing firm Serco, which is administering the credit for the Department for Work and Pensions.Contractors tried calling another 25,000 but failed to get through - while 4,000 claimants havent had a phone call at all.That means 29,000 people still havent been directly told that they will lose the benefit or asked if they want to be lent the money instead.Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood told The Sun today: “The Tories’ change of Support for Mortgage Interest from a social security payment to a loan is proving a complete failure.“There is little evidence that ministers are treating this issue with the seriousness it deserves. The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000180243126.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"flight mh370 photo mystery latest news conspiracy theories","story":"Christine Negroni said pics of washed up wreckage shows the Boeing 777s wing flaps were retracted when it smashed into the sea in March 2014.It means that the plane was not being fully controlled when it landed — casting further doubt on bombshell claims made by former Canadian air crash investigator Larry Vance.He told Australias 60 Minutes earlier this month that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah flew off course on a suicide mission and planned to kill himself and the 238 others on the journey from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur.Mr Vance said: He [the pilot] was killing himself unfortunately, he was killing everybody else on board, and he did it deliberately.And in his new book MH370: Mystery Solved, Mr Vance says evidence suggests Shah cruelly tried to ditch the plane as gently as possible to avoid creating wreckage that would make it easier to find.But Ms Negroni has blasted his conclusions as preposterous and absurd — and says photos prove her point.In a post on her website following the show, she fumed: Ladies and gents, thanks to 60 Minutes, pilots Vance and Hardy are in the cockpit.They’ve fuelled up with alternative facts and are taking us on a flight to the absurd.“Will we ever return from this remote region of reality? Stay tuned.”She accused the show of airing “far-fetched”, “hokum” details — in particular is claims about the wing flap suggesting a controlled landing.Vance had said the wings flaps, that washed ashore in 2016, were extended as they would be in a controlled landing.Mr Vance told Australian show 60 Minutes that the flaps were extended, just as they would be during a controlled landing.It lent weight to his theory that the pilot flew on a sinister murder-suicide mission, trying to ditch the plane gently in the water to prevent floating wreckage that could be visible to search teams.But his claim that the flaps were extended has been refuted — as photos show they were in fact in the retracted position.Flaps remain retracted during a flight and are deployed in controlled landings.If they are not extended, it suggests the pilot was not fully in control when the plane went down.MH370 search director Peter Foley said: “If it was being controlled at the end, it wasn’t very successfully being controlled. The flaps weren’t deployed.But Ms Negroni wrote Vance should have revisited that statement when a forensic examination showed the flaperon was very likely stowed, not deployed when the plane crashed.”She pointed to an October 2017 report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which said: It was established from the debris that the aircraft was not configured for a ditching at the end-of-flight.Analysis indicated that the flaps were most likely in a retracted position at the time they separated from the aircraft making a controlled ditching scenario very unlikely.Ms Negronis view has been backed by MH370 search director Peter Foley.He said: “If it was being controlled at the end, it wasn’t very successfully being controlled. The flaps weren’t deployed.One flap is being withheld by French authorities as they carry out their own criminal investigation.But a second flap that washed up in Tanzania in 2016 shows it was “probably not deployed”, according to Australian analysts.Mr Foleys agency did confirm that “it’s absolutely evident” someone had initially flown the plane off course, ruling out some mechanical or electrical malfunction.Various governments and private agencies have scoured the ocean for the main wreckage of the doomed flight but have failed to find it.A total of 239 people were on board, including 153 Chinese nationals, 50 Malaysians, seven Indonesians and Australian, French, Canadian, New Zealander, India, Iranian, Dutch, Russian, Taiwanese, Ukrainian and American nationals.Parts of this article originally appeared on News.au"},{"url":null,"title":"red marks girls ankles nursery staff taped shoes on","story":"Jessica Hayes was horrified to discover staff at the North Carolina daycare centre tied the 17-month-olds feet with masking tape because she kept taking them off.She shared images of her daughters skin bulging over the tightly wrapped tape and clear, dark bruising on her feet.Does anyone see an issue with this? she wrote alongside the photos.

This is untrue and is an unwarranted attack on GMP police officers who, as the actual footage showed, acted bravely in response to this horrific attack.The documentary featured unseen mobile phone video and unheard audio recordings, as well as exclusive access to the emergency services.Mr Hopkins said he and his staff were most deeply concerned about the impact on families of viewing this footage.He added: I fail to see any public interest in footage of such an explicit nature being aired with disregard to the feelings of those who matter most.The GMP chief suggested the material in the documentary breached the BBCs editorial guidelines.The programme, at least by inference, wrongly suggested that GMP officers and staff were held back on the night of the attack. This is untrue and is an unwarranted attack on GMP police officers who, as the actual footage showed, acted bravely in response to this horrific attack. At no point were GMP officers and staff held back and they were immediately deployed to the Arena to save life and protect people. In fact, GMPs Force Duty Officer made a decision not to withdraw officers contrary to national plans, a decision highlighted as courageous in the Independent Review into the response to the attack conducted by Lord Kerslake.I want to make it clear that Greater Manchester Police working within the framework of the National Counter Terrorism Network have had primacy over the response to the attack from the moment the attack occurred and the ongoing live criminal investigation. This is not made clear in the documentary and the style of reporting of this is entirely misleading. As the lead police force, for the response and the criminal investigation, GMP has significant constraints on what we can discuss publicly. The production company approached GMP in Autumn 2017 and after a face-to-face meeting we respectfully explained in detail the legal constraints we worked under and highlighted to the production company their own responsibilities. The production company approached us again sometime later and we reaffirmed this constraint and again declined to participate. It is within this context that the reference at the end of the programme that GMP refused to cooperate, is wholly misleading and was focused only on creating journalistic drama rather than accurately portraying the constraints we have repeatedly highlighted. We became aware, just days before the anniversary, that the documentary was going  to be broadcast and this came from a third party who disclosed the potential content of the programme. At this point, we expressed to the BBC our very serious concerns for the families, especially in relation to any footage of the scene that would show victims regardless of whether these were blurred out or not.We also explained again that GMP is leading a live murder investigation and a warrant was issued in October for the arrest of a suspect. We explained this means proceedings have started and as such we are very mindful of undermining a prosecution. In addition to this, we pointed out that there is an ongoing coronial process and we are again very clear that we should not make comment on matters within the jurisdiction of HM Senior Coroner.We asked repeatedly to view the footage so that we could work with the CPS, Coroner and our own family liaison officers to assess what legal implications it may have, but most importantly so that we could inform  and support families. We were not permitted to do this at any point before broadcast. Consequently the first time the investigation team saw the documentary was at the time of its broadcast last night.In the recent independent review into the response to the Arena attack from Lord Kerslake he voiced specific concerns over the conduct of the media in the aftermath of this tragedy and this documentary serves, in my view, to further illustrate the media’s irresponsibility. This documentary, in our view failed to accurately depict the events of the night, and is a partial reconstruction at best. The production company no doubt will say that organisations were offered the chance to cooperate and they chose not to, but these very organisations have an overriding duty to families and the courts and so cannot cooperate with a production company whose only aim is to provide newsworthy viewing at the expense of the families, coronial process and indeed a criminal trial.Most importantly when I became aware of the content of this documentary, my staff and I were most deeply concerned about the impact on families of viewing this footage. I fail to see any public interest in footage of such an explicit nature being aired with disregard to the feelings of those who matter most. Whether families wish to view such footage is a private matter and is not something that should be publicly aired on national television taking away any choice. Some families are left with the question -  is this my loved one on the floor?.Before the broadcast, I am aware that the CPS and the Coroner expressed serious reservations. I am also aware that having understood the potential enormity of the impact of the programme British Transport Police withdrew support and refused the BBC authority to use the material. Despite all this the broadcast went ahead.The duty of Greater Manchester Police is to support the families, search for evidence of what happened and present this evidence objectively to the courts. This takes time, there is an ongoing extradition process good reason for us being unable to provide detail. Thankfully the vast majority of the media understand and respect this. The broadcast of this programme and the material within it appears to breach the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines.This documentary however, is in our view entirely inappropriate and I deeply regret the impact the actions of the production company and the BBC may have on those who matter most - the victims’ families and survivors of one of the worst terrorist attacks this country has ever seenYours sincerely,Ian Hopkins, QPMChief ConstableGreater Manchester PoliceFeaturing interviews with counter-terrorism police and friends of Manchester-born bomber Salman Abedi, the film also explored what could have driven him to kill.He grew up in Britain, where his friends claim he lived a wild youth of booze and drug-taking, but his parents are originally from Libya.The killer is thought to have visited the North African country – a haven for ISIS fighters – regularly in the six years leading up to the Manchester bombing.It was claimed he rang his nuclear scientist mum Samia moments before detonating the rucksack bomb to say: Forgive me.Yesterday, the people of Manchester fell silent as bells rang out across the city at 10.31pm to mark the exact time of the attack one year ago.Thousands gathered in the darkness of St Ann’s Square on Tuesday night, where moving song lyrics were projected onto the side of the church.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From a financial point of view, that is certainly the case.M\u0026S was the first British retailer to make pre-tax profits of \u0026#1631bn under the legendary Sir Richard Greenbury back in 1998. The now Lord Rose of Monewden hit the same benchmark a decade later. Over the two decades, though, that achievement looks more and more like an upward blip in a downward spiral.Few would dispute Mr Rowe\u0027s diagnosis of the headwinds facing M\u0026S: the \"continued migration of clothing and home online, the development of global competition, the growth of home delivery in food and the march of the discounters\", along with a challenging consumer backdrop. The problem is that M\u0026S has known about some of these issues for many years and, with the benefit of hindsight, has failed to address them.Of particular disappointment is that, as Mr Rowe admits, M\u0026S\u0027s online capability is not as good as its competitors and its website is too slow.That is an implied criticism of Mr Bolland, who invested \u0026#1631bn in M\u0026S\u0027s logistics and technology, including \u0026#163200m alone on an automated warehouse at Castle Donington in Leicestershire. Mr Rowe admitted today that \"Castle Donington has struggled to cope with peak demand\".There have been other self-inflicted wounds, as well. Mr Rowe noted that in both food and in clothing and home, M\u0026S has seen its customer base narrow, with the loss of market share particularly acute among younger families.That may partly reflect the push towards high-end fashion under Mr Bolland and a failure, in the past, to identify and react to the rise of so-called \u0027fast-fashion\u0027 retailers like Zara, H\u0026M and Primark, the latter of whom has seen its share of the UK clothing market, by value, rise from 4.4% to 7% during the last decade while M\u0026S has seen its share fall from 9.7% to 7.6%.Of particular concern will be that food, the part of M\u0026S that Mr Rowe ran from 2012 to 2015, and which was the one unalloyed success during Mr Bolland\u0027s time at the helm, is starting to go backwards.While overall food sales were up, thanks to the opening of new Simply Food outlets, like-for-like sales, which measure sales from outlets trading under the same format for a year or more, fell in every quarter during the last final year, with the rate of decline accelerating during the final January to March quarter, although that may well reflect the \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 factor.So, Groundhog Day, then?Not necessarily. Mr Rowe, doubtless under the guidance of M\u0026S\u0027s hard-driving new chairman, Archie Norman, is stepping up the store closure programme. As the company announced on Tuesday, it will have 100 fewer stores by 2022, by which time it expects a third of its sales will be coming online. These are drastic measures.Some in the City are optimistic. Clive Black of Shore Capital, one of the best retail analysts around, told clients: \"The business, now in the hands of Messrs Norman and Rowe, is starting to make decisions that have arguably been needed for many years... the current lead [management] team appear, to our minds, to be the best chance that the business has had for some time to stabilise and press on.\"He said investors would doubtless be frustrated that M\u0026S has been in \"perpetual transition\" but that they would need to show \"more patience\".That patience is likely to be tested in coming weeks as M\u0026S faces possible relegation from the FTSE-100, a largely symbolic illustration of the company\u0027s fall from grace, but one that will no doubt sting the group\u0027s hundreds of thousands of loyal staff and more than 325,000 small shareholders.The big question, which some may find odd in the wake of the store closures just announced, is whether M\u0026S is being radical enough in its downsizing of the estate.Even after these store closures, it will still have 200 food, clothing and home stores, which looks too many for a business looking to accelerate its move to online.The second question concerns the dividend. This has been held at 18.7p a share for the full year and paying it costs \u0026#163303.4m.The dividend is less than one-and-a-half times covered by underlying earnings - a level of cover skimpier than model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley\u0027s M\u0026S lingerie. It would be interesting to know whether there has been any discussion of cutting the dividend.A lot of comment on these results will, inevitably, be negative."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-shahid-khan-wembley-stadium_4293190.jpg?20180426154131 ","title":"theresa may calls wembley stadium sale private matter as she dismisses calls to intervene","story":"He asked: \"When the Premier League has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on wages and transfers does the prime minister agree with me there is actually more than enough money in the game for there to be no need to sell off this asset?\"Mrs May retorted: \"That is a decision for the owners of Wembley.

It came as SNP MP Pete Wishart described the House of Lords as the circus down the corridor, embarrassing this nation and mocking any notion of democracy. An overwhelming 73% felt the Lords had become too big, with its 800 peers making it the second biggest parliamentary chamber after China’s National People’s Congress. The scathing judgement on the bloated Upper Chamber comes after Theresa May used the cover of the Royal Wedding to cloak another nine cronies in ermine, along with three Labour peers and for the DUP.  No 10 insisted Mrs May had shown “restraint” in appointing new peers. But a Comres survey for the Daily Mail revealed seven in 10 voters believe there should be fewer peers.  Thirty-seven per cent wanted all peers to be elected, with 24% saying the Lords should simply be scrapped and not replaced. And 79% said there were too many cronies or failed or retired politicians packing the Upper House. Speaking at Prime Minister’S Questions, SNP Commons spokesman Pete Wishart told MPs: “As the nation’s attention was on the Royal Wedding, the Prime Minister was busy stuffing the House of Lords with 13 new members - apparently we need more of the ‘right’ type of legislator. “How many more is she going to appoint and when will enough be enough?” Later, he linked the decision to a succession of Government defeats in the Upper Chamber. He said: “Creating more peers is cynical even for this Tory government and it is a real affront to democracy.  “The Tories are not even trying to disguise this - it is a complete fix. “There will now be over 800 – making it substantially larger than the House of Commons. “Every time the Tories face choppy waters over losing votes, they just stuff the place with more peers. “It is ludicrous that we have yet more Lords - and it is no surprise that there is growing anger about the role and power of these unelected cronies.”  Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said Labour wanted the Lords abolished and replaced with an elected Chamber. He added: “It is absurd that we still have this undemocratic anachronism in the 21st Century. “When Labour is elected we will carry through that pledge.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa been accused creating generation","story":"NewsTheresa May has been accused of creating a \"generation of undocumented people\" through her \"hostile environment\"SNP MP Ian Blackford said the Tories\u0027 immigration crackdown has \"targeted those who legally live here\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent21:00, 23 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May has been accused of creating a generation of undocumented people through her hostile environment immigration policy. SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford said that the Windrush Scandal had revealed that the Tories\u0027 immigration crackdown has targeted those who legally live here. And he raised the plight of young people who have grown up in the UK and know of nothing else face losing their lawful settled status because they simply cannot afford the paperwork. Mr Blackford, who has been damning in his criticism of the Government\u0027s attitude to immigrants, raised the issue at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions. Speaking in the House of Commons he warned that they are struggling to find the money to secure their immigration status because Home Office fees have increased by 148% since 2014.  These children have the right to be here the UK is their home, he said. I am giving the Prime Minister the opportunity today: will she scrap these fees for young people, as she has done for the Windrush generation? The Prime Minister insisted that a minor who has indefinite leave to remain will have access to benefits and entitlements which put them on an equal footing to their British citizen peers, so a grant of British citizenship is not therefore required. But Mr Blackford insisted there were about up to 120,000 young people in the UK in this difficult position. We are talking about young people who live here, who have to wait 10 years and pay up to \u0026pound10,000 to achieve permanent right to remain. It is shocking.  The Government are guilty of creating a generation of undocumented citizens without the rights that many of us take for granted. Will the Prime Minister change her policies that target young people? The Prime Minister said she did not recognise the \u0026pound10,000 figure he quoted. And she repeated the point that a minor who has indefinite leave to remain will have access to the benefits and entitlements that put them on an equal footing to their British citizen peers. A grant of British citizenship is not required in order for someone to access those rights and benefits.

She was urged to speak out after American billionaire Shahid Khan tabled a multi-million pound bid for the national stadium. Mr Khan owns the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL American football team, and wants to make Wembley their official home.  It would be the first NFL side to be based outside of the US in a deal reportedly worth \u0026pound1bn. But speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour’s Justin Madders said: I\u0027m sure the Prime Minister, like millions of other people, was glued to her TV set on Saturday watching an event of national importance. Sadly, there was not a fairytale ending, as Chelsea won the FA Cup.  But that could be the last FA Cup final played at Wembley before it is sold to an overseas owner. When Premier League clubs spend hundreds of millions of pounds every year on wages and transfers, does the Prime Minister agree with me that there is actually more than enough money in the game for there to be no need to sell off this iconic national asset? The Prime Minister said: Can I say to him, that is a decision for the owners of Wembley. It is a private matter, it is not a matter for the Government.  Labour deputy leader Tom Watson blasted May’s response. He said: “The sale of Wembley is not a \u0027private matter\u0027 as Theresa May has just said at PMQs. It\u0027s our national stadium and fans have to be heard. We are deeply sceptical of the proposal to sell Wembley.

And now, for the Duchess of Sussex, the serious work begins.  She and Prince Harry were already back on royal duties yesterday at a Buckingham Palace garden party celebrating Prince Charles’ 70th birthday .  But she has made it clear that her role in “the Firm” will be to do more than wear stylish dresses or just be arm candy for her husband.  Shortly after the wedding, her official biography on the Buckingham Palace website was out and in it she boldly announced she is “proud to be a woman and a feminist”. It was a signal she will be using her huge platform to support causes that help the advancement of women. Insiders say she has the blessing of the palace to do so.  It didn’t take long for the haters to pile in at the mention of the word feminist and I must admit that I initially groaned at the thought.  Of course I believe in equality of men and women which, by definition, makes me a feminist. But I’ve always felt excluded from feminism and feminist debates because they’re always dominated by one voice – well-off middle-class women. Instead of being inclusive, it is exclusive and rarely addresses the views and needs of ethnic minority or working-class women. It seems those who benefit most are usually already well paid and well connected. I’ve been to networking events about gender equality in business or the media and I can usually count the number of non-white women on one hand. During panel discussions I never hear anyone talking about tackling the lack of social or racial diversity. Instead it’s a certain group of women fighting for women like themselves. Women of colour have fought against sexism and racism, but their voice is rarely heard. I believe Meghan can change that. Yes she’s well-off and privileged, but her background, and the fact she was raised by a black woman, gives her a different perspective.  As her bio says, she’s had a keen awareness of social issues from an early age, instilled by her wonderful mother Doria Ragland . “Those early experiences helped shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment,” it says.

Leah was just 17 years old when the coaster crashed into a test car, crushing her leg amongst the twisted metal of the ride. Brave Leah was taken to hospital where doctors failed to save her injured leg. Now, three years on, Leah, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, has shared footage of her running for the very first time. She shared a video of her smiling while running alongside her physio Carolyn - captioning the clip: \u0027This is my first time running since my accident. it felt amazing\u0027. Leah was on a first date with her now long-term boyfriend Joe Pugh on the day of the crash.  Joe today congratulated Leah on the milestone moment, tweeting: YES GAL. Such a achievement.    Leah spoke earlier this year about the horrific accident and the moment doctors told her they had to remove her leg. Describing the ill-fated rollercoaster ride to Cosmopolitan, Leah said: I started yelling, no no no, and then...there was nothing. Only blackness, The next thing I remember was the screaming and the blood. There was so much of it. The metal of the safety bars had folded into our bodies. When she was finally freed Leah was taken to hospital, but doctors could not save her leg. The doctor came over in a white coat, she told Cosmo. He had kind, sad eyes and spoke to me slowly.  \u0027I’m so sorry. I had to amputate your left leg. It was seriously injured. It was the only way I could save you.\u0027 The 24-year-old has started blog, Limbitless , and documented her journey from being afraid she might not be able to run, to ordering prosthetics blades and taking on a 10k race. “Everybody is unique and people should be proud of that. I would love to help other people and that is my aim really.

As police arrive to arrest Dylan Harries he can be seen cradling the youngster - after stabbing Katrina Evemy multiple times in a savage attack on April 13 last year. The teenage mum was stabbed in the eyes, throat, leg and stomach - slicing her liver - and she was also badly bitten during the vicious assault. The 19-year-old was declared brain dead after ‘catastrophic and irreversible’ brain damage two days later on April 19. The footage - which has never been seen before today - features in a documentary which airs tonight with how Dyfed-Powys Police investigated the murder of the young mum from Llanelli is to be aired on S4C tonight.  It includes the moment Harries is arrested. He is seen being frisked by officers, initially appearing calm until the officers attempt to place him in handcuffs. At that point, Mr Harries makes demands to see “his daughter”, and is subdued on the sofa. Harries - who denied murdering his partner of seven-months - was eventually convicted of murder and jailed for 27 years last October. Harries protested his innocence - claiming he found the young mum covered in blood on the floor when he arrived at the house. But he was found guilty by jury after a two-week trial. Just over a year since the attack, Dyfed-Powys Police has partnered with S4C for a Welsh-language documentary on the police’s work on the case. A dramatic collection of police bodycam footage includes the moment officers arrested Mr Harries at Katrina’s address on Graig Avenue in Llanelli. Police reveal tonight how they proved their case against Harries, retracing his movements on CCTV and establishing a motive after digital forensic work on his phone. Just over a year since the attack, Dyfed-Powys Police has partnered with S4C for a Welsh-language documentary on the police’s work on the case. Detective Sergeant Kim Harries said that the case was “difficult and emotional”.  “She was a normal girl, going about her normal day, a young mum with a young daughter,” she said. “The injuries were horrific, like I’ve never seen before. It was very upsetting. “[Harries] was a very jealous, controlling person. And that drove him to a fit of jealous rage. “We instructed a forensic odontologist to look at a bite mark on Katrina’s arm as well as a cast of Dylan Harries’ teeth. His opinion was that it was conclusive that the bite mark had been made by him.” Detective Chief Inspector Ifan Charles added: “There are no winners when it comes to a murder investigation. You have a 19-year-old woman, Katrina Evemy who has tragically died, a daughter who won’t have a mother for the rest of her life and then Dylan Harries had his life ahead of him but made a terrible decision that day. “But I think at least now Katrina’s family have some closure, knowing that Dylan Harries has received justice for what he did.

She says he showed her she had received only six minors and told her: You’ve got yourself an early birthday present- you’ve passed!

I feel like the unluckiest person ever because they told me it hasn’t happened to anyone but me.”  The mum-of-two had thought she had passed with half a dozen minors after taking the test at Herne Bay driving test centre.

Kelsie claimed: “My examiner said ‘congratulations you’ve got yourself an early birthday present- you’ve passed!’ “I was so happy, nearly crying, but holding myself back because I didn’t want to embarrass myself. “I’ve been through a lot in my life and I was over the moon that things were finally going well for me.  “My driving instructor came running over to me because she could see the smile on my face. “The examiner went through the paper with us, showing me that I only had six minors.” Kelsie, from Broadstairs, Kent, was ecstatic to have \u0027passed\u0027 the test after previously failing on her first attempt. She returned home to celebrate with her family and friends, where she was greeted with congratulatory balloons, banners and cards. Her mum had helped her to buy a car, and she sent her papers off to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to get her driving licence. But a day later, while celebrating her birthday, she received a call from the test centre asking her to return the pass certificate to them.  Shockingly, she says they then told her she hadn’t passed after all. A letter addressed to Kelsie, from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency’s (DVSA) Operational Delivery Manager, Mark Aston, said a serious fault had been recorded during her test. The letter, dated April 14, read: “After your test on Wednesday 11th April at 13:35 our in-house checks identified a serious fault had been assessed and recorded during your test but due to an administrative error, your examiner issued a pass. “You can only pass your test if you receive fewer than 15 driving faults and there are no serious or dangerous faults recorded. “With this in mind, I am sorry to confirm that you have not passed your driving test and that you should only be driving in accordance with the provisional licence regulations.” It added: “Finally, please accept my sincere apologies for any upset and inconvenience that this error may have caused.” "},{"url":null,"title":"no one speaks dad us","story":"News\u0027No one speaks for me and my dad but us\u0027: Read poisoned Yulia Skrpial\u0027s powerful statement in fullThe 33-year-old said she has declined support from the Russian Embassy in the aftermath of the \"assassination attempt\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDave Burke18:57, 23 MAY 2018NewsYulia Skripal said she wants to return to Russia one day (Image: REUTERS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Yulia Skripal, who was left fighting for her life after she and her father Sergei were poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury, has spoken publicly for the first time since the attack.  The 33-year-old is in a secret location under the protection of the British government. She and her father, a former Russian military intelligence Colonel who betrayed dozens of agents to MI6, were found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury on March 4. In her first media statement since it happened, she defiantly said she has declined support from the Russian Embassy in the aftermath of the assassination attempt. Yulia was discharged from hospital on April 9, but said her treatment has been invasive, painful and depressing.  Yulia Skripal\u0027s statement in full I came to the UK on the 3rd of March to visit my father, something I have done regularly in the past. After 20 days in a coma, I woke to the news that we had both been poisoned. I still find it difficult to come to terms with the fact that both of us were attacked. We are so lucky to have both survived this attempted assassination. Our recovery has been slow and extremely painful. The fact that a nerve agent was used to do this is shocking. I don\u0027t want to describe the details but the clinical treatment was invasive, painful and depressing.  I am grateful to all of the wonderful, kind staff at Salisbury hospital, a place I have become all too familiar with. I also think fondly of those who helped us on the street on the day of the attack. I was discharged from hospital on the 9th of April and continue to progress with treatment but my life has been turned upside down as I try to come to terms with the devastating changes thrust upon me both physically and emotionally. I take one day at a time and want to help care for my Dad till his full recovery. In the longer term I hope to return home to my country.  I wish to address a couple of issues directly and have chosen to interrupt my rehabilitation to make this short statement. I ask that everyone respects the privacy of me and my father. We need time to recover and come to terms with everything that has happened.

Hannah Langton, 26, had been told that at 27 weeks pregnant she was a medical priority, and a rescue vehicle would be with her in 90 minutes. But when ‘help’ arrived the RAC van drove straight past her – despite having switched on the hazard lights on her large silver seven seater vehicle. When Hannah called back the RAC she was shocked to be accused of not being at the location when they turned up. “Where else was I meant to go? I couldn’t drive off. The whole clutch was gone and I couldn’t even get the car in gear, Hannah said. “I was terrified. I was at the side of a 70mph road and when lorries drove past feet away, the whole car really shook. “I had only just managed to freewheel off the road into a little layby that luckily was right there. I avoided a complete catastrophe but I was still really shook up.  “It was dark and the heater in my car was broken so the temperature kept dropping the later it got. I had no jacket and I was afraid I’d have to sleep there for the night. “I was crying. I was really worried about the baby. The road was quite isolated and I felt really desperate. Hannah had been suffering from hip and back pain and at 27 weeks pregnant she felt unable to abandon her mum’s car at the side of Welsh Road on the A550 and walk the one and a half hour trek back to her home in Deeside, Wales. So she decided to stay in the vehicle, unable to move for five hours as she was too scared to open the door and step out onto the fast moving dual carriageway. Her boyfriend, Thomas Johnson, said he called the RAC to try to get help for his pregnant partner about 4 times, and each time he was kept on hold for 40 - 100 minutes before his calls were answered.  “They told me she had not been there when they called. And she was stuck there petrified the whole time. “I was in Liverpool and I can’t drive so I called everyone I knew who might be able to collect her but because it was a bank holiday everyone was away,” he said. After midnight, the RAC sent out a third party operator to tow Hannah and her vehicle back to safety. “I was so relieved when I was collected. I was really shaken up. I had stomach cramps and fake contractions from the stress, Hannah said. The experience on May 6 has left Hannah afraid of driving alone, which is difficult because she relies on her car to get to her job at a dog kennels. “I’m nervous now. I can’t drive alone and I will definitely not renew my membership with the RAC,” she said.

The couple tied the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel on May 19 in an extravagant - but touching - ceremony. Their family and friends gathered - along with millions of people around the world - to see the happy pair say I do. With so much going on though you may have missed a few things. It\u0027s a little frightening when you consider how much work went into a single day. We\u0027ve taken a look at the facts and figures to break it all down for you. Meghan followed in Princess Diana\u0027s footsteps Harry and Meghan read traditional vows from the Common Book of Prayer, though Meghan left out the word obey - just like Diana did. Kate Middleton also left the word out when she married William in 2011. Meghan made history  Meghan began her wedding procession alone - after her father remained in the USA or an operation - though she was joined by Prince Charles at the Quire. She\u0027s the first royal bride to walk down the aisle without an escort. Meghan and Harry got new titles Hours before the wedding, the Queen announced they were now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. There were a ton of celebs at the wedding and reception  David and Victoria Beckham were there, as were Amal and George Clooney. James Corden rocked up with his wife, and compered the reception later, even getting the royals to dance off. Meghan\u0027s friends, including Serena Williams, Priyanka Chopra and her Suits co-stars also were invited to the wedding.  Harry\u0027s exes were at the wedding Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davis both attended, but everyone was fine with it, because that\u0027s what the royals do. Meghan\u0027s veil had intricate details  The 15-ft long veil was designed by Givenchy\u0027s Clare Waight Keller. She had flowers for every single commonwealth country as per Meghan\u0027s request. Meghan had two dresses The first was by Givenchy, the second was by Stella McCartney and was more Hollywood in its look - a lily white halter neck. Meghan wore shoes from Aquazurra made in silky satin, with nude mesh and soles painted in baby blue.  Meghan\u0027s tiara was her something old She wore Queen Mary\u0027s old tiara which was lent to her by Queen Elizabeth II. She deliberately had subtle make up Just like Kate, Meghan had her close friends do her makeup rather than a professional.  Meghan\u0027s dad wasn\u0027t there Thomas Markle Snr had causes quite the drama beforehand. He was set to attend the wedding, but caused controversy when it was revealed pap pictures of him reading a book about London and googling his daughter were set up. It later emerged he needed a heart operation and would be unable to fly to the wedding or walk Meghan down the aisle. He told TMZ: My baby looks beautiful, and she looks very happy. He added: I wish I were there, and I wish them all my love and happiness.  Though her mum was - and alone   Doria Ragland sat alone, though it\u0027s thought the Bride and Groom sorted the seating. Harry\u0027s family were on the right, Meghan\u0027s on the left. She had a tear in her eye as she watched her daughter get married. What Harry said to Charles When Prince Charles reached Harry at the altar , Harry looked at him and said: Thank you, Pa. The entertainment in the church was amazing There were 23 boy choristers from St George\u0027s School as well as Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the 19-year-old who won BBC Young Musician of the Year, who was the cellist at the wedding. There was also a gospel choir who sang Etta James and Stand By Me. There were twins as page boys  The son of Meghan\u0027s best friend Jessica were page boys - Brian and John held her veil and looked very excited about it all. Prince George was also a page boy and his sister Charlotte was a bridesmaid. There were no adult bridemaids.  There was an A-list guestlist 600 invitations were made by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood for the event, though only 200 were invited to Frogmore House. The couple also invited members of the public, with 2,640 people getting an invite. Made up of 1,200 nominated by nine regional Lord Lieutenent officers 200 people from charities and organisations 100 pupils from local schools the Royal School and St George\u0027s School 610 Windsor Castle\u0027s community members 530 members of the Royal Households and Crown Estate. Bishop Michael Curry went down a storm  The preacher gave a stirring sermon, that had the royals looking a little shocked. People seemed to love it though, and the message about civil rights, love and the power to change the world. It was a big logistical event Volunteers helped out on the day, with 140 Royal Borough Ambassadors stewarding. It cost \u0026pound30 to park at the Review Ground on the day, and there were 6,000 spots. Security operation About \u0026pound30m was spent on security for the wedding. The Met Police identified 160 \u0027stalkers\u0027 before the event.  TV channels All the channels from around the world descended on Windsor. Most impressive though was Sky who laid 27km of cable to broadcast the coverage in UHD, making them the first broadcaster to televise it in 4k. Their first dance was to Whitney Houston They went for something a bit different and had I Wanna Dance With Somebody - instead of dancing alone they invited their guests to the dancefloor with them. They went into a bit of jive and lindy hop. Jaguar E-Type  The number plate was the date of the wedding. The car was a silver blue classic convertible Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, originally made in 1968 but made into an electric car. The reception was at Frogmore House ...so called because of the frogs that live in the low lying marshy area. It\u0027s only open on three ticketed charity days. Guests partied in a glass marquee, it was also where they had their sit down meal.  The cake was massive There was quite an ingredients list for the cake.   The flowers were donated to a hospice  Floral designer Phillippa Craddock directed a team, including florists from St George\u0027s Chapel and Buckingham Palace, to create the wedding displays. The flowers have gone to St Joseph\u0027s Hospice in Hackney, East London.   They had a great evening reception  There\u0027s so many details from the reception we gathered them all together in our behind-the-scenes break down of what happened . Highlights included a firework display at 11pm, George Clooney dancing with Meghan, but being shunned by Fergie and a special cocktail being created for Harry with ginger in it as a nod to his red hair.  Dirty burgers were served with candyfloss. Serena Williams played beer pong Apparently she played it like it was tennis.  Idris Elba had a turn on the decks While DJ Sam Totolee provided the music in the main, Idis did a stint as well. Think 80s and R\u0026ampB. Elton John sang a Disney song  He also sang Tiny Dancer, Your Song, and I\u0027m Still Standing. The Disney song was Circle of Life. Meghan gave a speech Harry gave a speech as did Prince William, where he teased his brother, but Meghan also stood up to talk. She thanked Charles for walking her down the aisle and for such a warm welcome. Awww.

Daniel Doherty pocketed at least \u0026pound75,000 by providing fake health and vaccination documents for the designer puppies. The animals had been bred in puppy farms in Ireland but the paperwork gave the impression they came from local loving homes. Many later fell sick and died.  The 49-year-old vet was given a 12-month sentence suspended for a year and ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud. The prosecution at Isleworth crown court followed a three year investigation by the RSPCA following complaints from families whose new puppies became ill.  Among those appalled by the sentence is Yonni Wilson of the group Say No To Pet Shop Pups. “This is more of an encouragement than a deterrent to other gangs who want to try their hand at puppy fraud,” she said, adding that she now hopes he will at least be struck-off as a vet. The two ringleaders, Simon O’Donnell, 30, and Thomas Stokes, 26, were each jailed for three years for fraud and animal welfare offences. Thomas O’Donnell, 29, was given a two year suspended sentence, while Margaret McDonagh, 27, and Mary McDonagh, 29, were given community orders. “We feel that these penalties are groteseque for gang members who fraudulently made a colossal amount of money and only two got custodial sentences, and those were extremely lenient,” said Ms Wilson, a former managing partner at a vet\u0027s practice.  “The reaction from people who follow our campaign to say no to pet shop puppies is that they feel betrayed and let down.” The gang was stopped after raids by the RSPCA and politan Police in which dogs were found crammed into sheds and garages and at one address four dead Yorkshire terrier puppies were discovered in black bin bags in a garden.  RSPCA inspector Kirsty Withnall, who led the investigation, described the crime as “a complex and sophisticated network of organised fraud and cruelty to dogs”. “Four of the gang members are siblings and, together with their partners, launched this network of puppy sellers and dealers in west London, with Edward and Mary Teresa Stokes later continuing to sell dogs from their new address in Reading, Berkshire, while Thomas Stokes went on to sell again from another property in Feltham, she said.  “This was a complicated and multi-faceted, high volume conspiracy whereby the gang has misrepresented commercial, puppy-farmed dogs imported from abroad as family-bred pets to con members of the public out of money. “Puppies were illegally imported from southern Ireland before being transported to the defendants’ homes where they were kept in plastic sheds, outbuildings and garages. They were advertised online and sold for between \u0026pound350 and \u0026pound650 each. “The gang were generally dealing with fashionable breeds and designer crossbreeds such as Yorkies, cavapoos and Labradoodles.”  She described how the gang went to great lengths to give the impression that the puppies had been born and raised in loving homes. The sellers would appear to be caring couples with children, and “stooge” bitches were used to give the appearance of being the mother of the puppies. A total of 5,097 puppies are know to have been sold over five years, though the RSPCA suspect the true figure could be much higher. All of the dogs that were seized as part of the investigations went into foster homes and were later signed over to the RSPCA to be rehomed.  *The campaign Say No To Pet Shop Pups focuses on Linton Pet Store, a pet shop at a garden centre in Theresa May\u0027s Maidenhead constituency that sells puppies. It previously used Daniel Doherty as its vet. Yonni Wilson is now calling on it to contact all customers who bought puppies during this period to warn them that their pet\u0027s immune system might be compromised by inadequate treatment by Doherty. Store owner Jean Pierre Caruana previously said that he knew nothing about Doherty\u0027s fraud, describing it as “A really big shock”, adding: “His case is not connected to us, we are doing nothing wrong, we have a licence from the council.” Say No To Pet Shop Pups supports our Lucy\u0027s Law campaign which is calling for an immediate ban on the sale of puppies by pet shops and other third parties who are not the breeders. The only exception would be rescue centres.

Instead Mr Hewitt, 60, was spotted shopping at Sainsbury\u0027s in Exeter, the city where he lives with his mother Shirley in a two-bedroom flat.

Charlotte Bonwick, who has a permanent stoma bag and is fed through a tube, claims she was told by the service to instead get her clean needles from an exchange usually reserved for drug addicts. The 23-year-old, who was born with her intestines outside her body, needs to inject medication every eight hours to stabilise her body, which has been ravaged by sepsis a shocking six times. The West Sussex woman claims she was recently told by her doctor she could no longer have a NHS script for hypodermic syringes.  She also says her regular prescription for anti-sickness drug, Cyclizine, which she needs to inject to help keep water down and weight on, had been reduced to meagre rations and was having negative impacts on her health. Due to absorption problems, I cannot just take a tablet. I have to have medication in other forms, eg. patches which stick onto the skin and release the drug, injections, medication that melts under the tongue, IV through my central line. These medications are so important when trying to live life as normal as possible. Too fearful to visit a needle exchange, the young woman, who is so ill she cannot work, has begun borrowing money from her parents to afford the \u0026pound500-a-month private prescription for syringes. She said: This whole thing came out of the blue, I had no warning whatsoever - it\u0027s made me really upset because now I can\u0027t rely on them.  Whenever I went to go and pick up my prescription they said they lost it - that\u0027s how it started. They couldn\u0027t tell me where the prescription was - it came across a bit strange. I have been on drugs since I was born - it seems they are just phasing me out, they told me that the drugs were just too expensive, but these are the only ones that work.” How am I supposed to take my medication.  Free charity needle exchanges are usually set up to improve the health of drug addicts by giving them a free way to get new needles, rather than having to share. She contacted Mid Sussex East Shoreham CCG to raise her issue . She added: They told me to go the needle exchange.

Mum-of-two Becky Marks didn\u0027t kiss her partner for more than six months in case she came into contact with caffeine. The mother from Cornwall also feared \u0027cross-contamination\u0027 if she kissed her children.  She was even afraid of swallowing her own saliva in case that had been contaminated and avoided all cutlery and plates - eating only sealed microwave meals, Cornwall Live reports.    Becky sought help from Nik and Eva Speakman, regular therapists on ITV\u0027s This Morning program - and incredibly by the end of their three hour therapy session she had overcome her phobia.  At the start of her session Becky told the Speakmans: I haven\u0027t kissed him on the lips for six and a bit months. I have tried in the past [to kiss the children] but it just causes too much anxiety.  The therapists believe Becky\u0027s phobia and contamination OCD was triggered by the traumatic loss of a premature baby girl when she was 16.   The baby only lived for a short while after birth, just 10 minutes, and Becky sought help for grief and anxiety. She said: All I remember is that the doctor said caffeine makes anxiety worse. A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent and excessive fear of an object or situation.  The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person will go to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, to a degree greater than the actual danger posed.  If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress. Occasionally they are triggered by a negative experience with the object or situation. It is recommended that specific phobias be treated with exposure therapy where the person is introduced to the situation or object in question until the fear resolves.  Medications are not useful in this type of phobia. Specific phobias affect about 6–8% of people in the Western world and 2–4% of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in a given year. Typically onset is around the age of 10 to 17. Rates become lower as people get older.

She is reported to have gone into the fast food restaurant after a night of partying. The woman is wearing a sheer top and tiny black skirt that is hitched up around her waist. German newspaper Bild said she was filmed in the Majorcan town of Inca at 11am on Sunday. Majorcan newspaper Ultima Hora also carried the picture, linking it to the drunken tourism the island is fighting against. The newspaper also mentioned the party resort Magaluf , which is 29 miles away from Inca. Inca is in the centre of the island and is not a mass tourism hotspot.  Bild claimed the woman was with with two friends and needed the burger as a hangover cure and headlined its article “This is how you ask for a hamburger in Majorca”. It added: “Her already tight skirt has probably slipped over her buttocks.”  It was previously reported how boozy British tourists had been warned to think twice before stripping naked in Magaluf as they could be fined hundreds of pounds. Officials on the Spanish island introduced new laws in 2015 to clean up its image as a wild party town for stag and hen dos and tanked-up teens.  Anyone found committing alcohol-fuelled rowdy acts like balcony hopping, urinating in public and skinny-dipping can now be given an on-the-spot fine. CCTV and police patrols were also beefed up, as well as a ban on drinking in the street between 10pm and 8am, and shops can no longer sell booze after midnight. Anyone found urinating in the street and being naked in public could be made to pay €750 (\u0026pound658). Spanish authorities have been cracking down on unruly behaviour on the streets of Magaluf in recent years.  In April it was reported Magaluf cops have banned a pub crawl by 90 boozy Brits in a clampdown on “uncivic” behaviour. Police said the outing was “totally against” regulations put in place to combat public drunkenness by visitors to the popular tourist island.

It wasn’t exactly encouraging.\u0026#8221Mark was 19 when he left Dundee and decided to travel Europe by rail, and it was those experiences that prompted him to write a book, titled Changing Trains.\u0026#8220The main character in the story is Sam, but much of it is based on my own experiences travelling alone in Europe in 1985,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’m a big fan of the novelist Christopher Isherwood, whose books formed the basis for the film Cabaret.\u0026#8220My title is a nod to his book Mr Norris Changes Trains.\u0026#8220Isherwood’s Fraulein Schroeder is remembered in my book as Madame Gilbert and all the young female characters that Sam encounters in my book kind of collectively represent Isherwood’s Sally Bowles.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220When I travelled across Europe in 1985, we were still in the cold war era \u0026#8211 weird to think we could heading that way again now \u0026#8211 and it was pre-Shengen, so I had to go through border controls as I entered and left each country and there was no euro at this point, so I had to get my head around constantly changing my currencies \u0026#8211 pounds to francs to pesetas to lira. This is all described in the book, and I have a little fun with it.\u0026#8221Mark began writing the book in 2010, while he was travelling between his work in London and a small house in France.\u0026#8220I’m a huge fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories and when I travelled to places like Paris, Monte Carlo, Venice and the French Riviera \u0026#8211 all places that have appeared in Fleming’s novels \u0026#8211 it really felt like you were in the world of Bond, so I play with this a bit too,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And when I went Interrailing, I travelled \u0026#8211 as everyone did back then \u0026#8211 with a number of compilation tapes for my Walkman, so the soundtrack to the book is also very 80s.\u0026#8220Everything from Duran Duran’s Bond theme ‘A View to a Kill’ to Simple Minds’ Glittering Prize album. Fab music.\u0026#8221The story starts in Dundee, and Mark said it was central to the story of Sam\u0026#8217s journey from uncertain, undecided small-town boy to a modern, outward-looking European with a sense of direction in his life.\u0026#8220Once the main character Sam has left Dundee and is discovering new cities like Paris, Barcelona and Monte Carlo, he often compares them with his origins. His experience of ‘otherness’ opens new possibilities to him, ones that weren’t available in Dundee at that time,\u0026#8221 Mark said.He initially started looking for a publisher for the book but decided instead to self-publish and said the reviews had been great.\u0026#8220I’ve been amazed at how many people have said it really took them back to that period and reminded them of their own lives back then. I love that it resonates with them,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’ve also done some readings in London and a few guest spots on blogs.

ferrie","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoung Dundee goalie Calum Ferrie says getting his first start at senior level was a massive confidence boost – now he’s looking to use that to springboard a successful career at Dens Park.The 19-year-old, signed from Port Vale two years ago, impressed manager Neil McCann enough to see him made second-choice behind Elliott Parish, despite the signing of Jeremy Malherbe in January.That brought a debut at Ibrox in April after Parish was hurt late on before Ferrie was rewarded with a new contract and then his first start on the final day of the season.That ended in frustration for the Dark Blues as they were beaten 1-0 by Partick Thistle after a limp performance and left Ferrie “annoyed” that his hopes of keeping a clean sheet had been dashed.He said: “The result wasn’t what we wanted and we could have done better.“However, on a personal note it was a great achievement to play and I feel I did alright.“It was a good confidence booster for myself to get that full start under my belt, I really enjoyed it.“It’s always frustrating as a keeper because you can’t really influence the play in front of you.“That’s just the life of the goalkeeper – it can be a lonely position. Sometimes you just have to look after yourself, make sure you give your team the best chance to go and win a game by making saves when you need to.“All I did really in that Partick game was do my job.“I conceded a goal which is very annoying because I just want to keep clean sheets – that’s what goalkeepers are built on.“I wasn’t happy about that but, overall, it was a pleasing performance for myself.”And Ferrie did impress, making timely saves as well as commanding his area with Partick quickly putting the rookie keeper under pressure from the off.An early save that saw him claw an Adam Barton header out of the top corner set him on his way and, although he couldn’t stop Kris Doolan poking in the winner, he was happy with this performance.On that Barton header: “It had me worried when it was looping over me! I was thinking ‘oh, no, it’s looping, it’s looping, please get there!’“I managed to just get there and then, after that, there was a corner and with a young keeper they were going to put it on me. That’s what anyone does with a young keeper, and I got a good punch on it.“I felt that was important because it meant they maybe didn’t put it on me as much. I found in the second half they didn’t. The crosses were a bit further out, which was good.“Teams might look at that because I’m maybe not as big as other goalkeepers. I’m 6ft 1in but it doesn’t matter, you just have to be dominant and you get yourself out for crosses.“I’ve always tried to do that because I always think if you attack it 100% you can get there even if they are six foot seven or eight.“If you want that ball more than them then you can go get it.”His displays in training and for the successful U/20 side, saw him handed another year’s deal by Dundee and Ferrie is determined to make the most of the chance he’s been given.He added: “It was good to get that signed, get secure for next year knowing I can come back and work 100% again to make sure that gets me as far as I can go.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/SMac_Invertay_House_Maule_Monifieth17100501.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"fresh hope of building facility for local community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to build a new community centre in the local area could be back on the table.The Monifieth Community Resource Group (MCRG) suffered a huge setback in March when a £1 million request to the Big Lottery Fund to refurbish Invertay House was rejected.The former school building was earmarked to be turned into a multi- purpose centre to hold sports and community events.Angus Council had most recently used the premises to process benefit inquiries, but agreed to the community asset transfer in August last year.Jean Lee, chairwoman of MCRG, said: “Before Invertay House was declared surplus to requirements by Angus Council, and we began the whole process, we had done a huge amount of work on the potential development of a community hub on land beside the Blue Seaway.\u0026#8220We were at the stage of being ready to apply to the Big Lottery for funding. Our plans were well advanced and we were very enthusiastic about them.“However, the decision was made to shelve those plans and pursue the option of Invertay House because it was accepted it had always been first choice of building by the community.”However, £2m was needed to realise the ambition, and with the Big Lottery grant application having been turned down, the MCRG is now considering the previous plan to build a brand new facility in the Blue Seaway park area, near to the waterfront, in conjunction with Monifieth Athletic FC.Jean said: “The Blue Seaway option is now again our best option.“We can have a fit-for-purpose building in a magnificent setting – a building that provides for local groups, community events and individuals who just want to have somewhere to socialise, an activities space that will ensure the viability of the whole community project.“Monifieth needs this building and we are ready again to start work on making it happen. We have had very positive preliminary discussions with Monifieth Athletic to take this forward as a joint project.“They had ambitions to create a sports hub down at the riverfront and we had always shared the understanding that we would support them in this ambition after we had secured our community centre.

They started to chase after the car in case he injured someone and the bouncer told him to give him the keys.Police were called and Palade disappeared, however when police attended, he returned with a spare set of keys and tried to get into his car and start it up.Officers prevented him from doing so and a roadside breath test showed a reading of 134 mics. He was then taken to Bell Street HQ but would not agree to provide two further specimens of breath and would not provide any explanation, Mrs Bruce said.Solicitor Nicola Brown told the court Palade had “panicked” when told what the roadside breath test reading was and had failed to provide further tests.She said in terms of the driving offence, he had driven about 300 metres.Ms Brown said he had gone to the pub for a drink with a colleague but ended up consuming far more than he had intended and had foolishly decided to move his car away from the restricted parking area he was in to avoid getting a parking ticket the following day.She said he intended to sell the car to pay for any fine that was imposed.Sheriff Alastair Carmichael fined Palade £800 and banned him from driving for 16 months.

selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03eb105ae54.jpg ","title":"zimbabwe international striker macauley bonne tops dundee wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the border.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the
