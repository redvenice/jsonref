Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.          Field learned not to talk about previous lovers and later became \u0027terrified\u0027 of running into any man she knew, regardless of whether or not she was in a relationship with him priorDuring the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.Field writes: \u0027This could not have been a good thing and I couldn\u0027t understand why everyone around him acted so nonchalant while this man was writhing in pain, panicked that his heart was about to stop\u0027.Field gave Reynolds a brown paper bag to breathe into and wrapped hot towels around his feet, face and hands. Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist. Clearly I didn\u0027t have my wits about me\u0027.\u0027This would hurt him\u0027: Sally Field is relieved that Burt...Sally Field reveals she was repeatedly sexually abused by...Hidden agony of America\u0027s sweetheart: Sally Field was abused...\u0027It was instantaneous, four days felt like four years\u0027:...Share this articleHis episodes led Field to take Reynolds to the Miami Heart Institute for a checkup on his heart, which came back all clear.Reynolds dismissed her attempts to get him into therapy for his anxiety, which she thought was causing his heart palpitations, because he thought it was \u0027self-delusional poppycock\u0027.But Reynolds thought that drugs could cure Field\u0027s health issues, and when she had a headache he offered her a strong Percodan.When she asked for an aspirin instead, his voice turned to irritated impatience, which Field calls his \u0027how dare you doubt my know-how\u0027 tone.Field says the message he was sending her was \u0027do it now, go!\u0027 so she took the pill and felt sick with her heart pounding.           Reynolds dismissed her attempts to get him into therapy for his anxiety, which she thought was causing his heart palpitations, because he thought it was \u0027self-delusional poppycock\u0027          Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.As the months went by Reynolds became \u0027louder, short-tempered and impatient,\u0027, she writes. Field was doing all the cooking and cleaning in his Los Angeles home, buying things and \u0027fulfilling every wish before he could even wish for it\u0027.She was paying for everything out of her own pocket but when she finally got up the courage to ask Reynolds for some money, he refused.He said: \u0027My business manager gives me only a thousand dollars a week. If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/14/50214AD000000578-6180733-image-a-14_1537277545387.jpg","title":"Midterms 2018 need know November elections","story":"    The fate of the U.S. Congress hangs in the balance as the 2018 midterm elections loom largeWhat are midterm elections?Midterm elections in the United States are elections held on a quadrennial basis every four years during the midpoint of a U.S. President’s four-year office term.In the United States, all 50 states receive two Senate seats irrespective of their population for a total of 100 seats while the 435 House of Representatives seats are delegated based on population, with a larger state such as California receiving far more representation in the chamber than states with much smaller populations like Wyoming, Vermont and Delaware.All 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives are contested in midterm elections, while 33 to 34 Senate seats out of 100 total are also up for grabs, meaning that midterm elections can have a major impact on which party controls Congress.Midterm elections also have a key impact on state and local level politics, as 36 out of the 50 governorships in the U.S. hold elections during the midterms while many mayoral elections are also held throughout the U.S.Historically, turnout for midterm elections in the United States has been lower than presidential elections, with roughly 40 percent of eligible voters going to the polls as opposed to 50 to 60 per cent for presidential elections.In addition, the President’s party typically loses seats during most midterm elections, with notable examples being the ‘Republican Revolution’ of 1994 in which the Republican Party took control of Congress and the 2006 midterm elections, which saw the Democrats seize control of both houses of Congress in what was seen as a major rebuke to former President George W. Bush.In the United States, more rural areas tend to favor the Republican Party while more urban, erse areas typically favor the Democratic Party.When are the 2018 midterm elections?The 2018 midterm elections will be held on Tuesday, November 6.          The election will soon have a major impact on political issues like taxes, immigration and moreSenateThe Republicans currently hold a narrow 51 seat majority in the Senate and are facing strong headwinds, though have one clear advantage: the Democrats will be on the defensive. The Democratic Party is currently defending 26 seats while the Republican Party is only defending nine, possibly giving them an edge going into the election.The Senate will see a number of key elections to watch closely as the 2018 midterms draw near.One key race is in Arizona for the seat held by the late Senator John McCain, which is currently being targeted by the Democrats for a potential pickup. Republican candidate Martha McSally is thought to face a tough challenge from Democratic candidate Kyrsten Sinema.The state’s shifting demographics, notably its large and growing Latino population, and isions between traditional Republicans like McCain and pro-Trump populists have threatened to weaken the Republicans’ long-held grip on the state.Other key Senate races to keep an eye on include a surprisingly competitive race between sitting Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke, who only narrowly trails Cruz according to most polls in the traditionally-Republican state.In Nevada, Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Dean Heller are locked in a tight race, as are Republican Josh Hawley and Democrat Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrat Phil Bredesen and Republican Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, another traditionally-Republican state.In Florida, one of the most famous bellwether states in the U.S., the race between Democrat Bill Nelson and Rick Scott is also extremely competitive.House of RepresentativesThough the Republicans currently control the House of Representatives, the Democrats are seen as having a strong chance to retake the congressional chamber, needing 24 seats to gain majority control of it.Republicans currently hold 240 seats compared to 195 for the Democrats.However, over the past 50 years, the Democrats have only gained more than 24 seats twice: in 1974, in the wake of the infamous Watergate scandal, and in 2006, when opposition to former President George W. Bush over the Iraq War reached a fever pitch.Fortunately for the Democrats, a record 39 sitting Republicans in the House of Representatives have opted to not seek reelection, giving them a chance to pick up seats in many states, including longtime swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida.A key race to watch closely is in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, where Democrat Conor Lamb stunned observers to win a special election in March 2018 for a seat that had been held by Republicans from 2003 to 2017 and was considered to be in Trump-friendly territory.Lamb will now be facing off against Republican Keith Rothfus after court-ordered redistricting in a new district that’s thought to be considerably friendlier to the Democrats.          Democrat Beto O\u0027Rourke is putting up a very strong challenge against Texas Senator Ted Cruz GovernorsKey races are also slated to get underway at the gubernatorial level as Democrats and Republicans face off in key swing states like Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Colorado.Republicans currently hold 33 governorships, although the Democrats are looking to build on their anticipated momentum and make gains at the state level as well as in Congress.A key race to watch is in Florida, as Democrat Andrew Gillum, fresh off an upset victory in the primaries, is looking to become the first African-American to become governors of the state. The outspoken progressive and Tallahassee mayor will face off against Republican Representative Ron DeSantis, a vocal proponent of Donald Trump’s policies.Other notable races to watch closely include competitive elections in Georgia, where Democrat Stacy Abrams is looking to become the first African-American woman to win a gubernatorial race in the U.S. as she faces off against Republican Brian Kemp and in the swing state of Iowa, where Republican Kim Reynolds is locked in a tight battle with Democrat Fred Hubbell.2018 midterm election predictionsThough the 2018 midterm election is still several weeks away, both historical and current trends have helped pollsters and election prognosticators draw up what they believe is a likely scenario for the outcome of the election.Given the fact that the sitting President’s party generally loses seats in midterm elections and President Donald Trump is hobbled by fairly low approval ratings, many election forecasters believe that the upcoming election will produce strong results for the Democrats and favor them taking at least one house of Congress, both of which are currently controlled by the Republicans.According to FiveThirtyEight, the Senate has a more than 67 percent chance to remain in Republican hands as of September 17. This is largely due to the fact that the Democrats have to defend a much wider range of seats during the election, including ones in states won by Trump in the 2016 election.Having to defend so many seats could blunt the ‘blue wave’ that many election forecasters have predicted for the Democrats and possibly leave the Senate in Republican control, though many races are thought to be especially competitive and could easily swing one way or another.The Democrats are thought to have much better odds in the House of Representatives, where FiveThirtyEight is forecasting the Democrats’ chances of retaking the chamber of more than 82 percent as of September 17.Although the Republicans currently have a solid majority of 240 seats, the Democrats have a clear historical advantage and are also buoyed by strong and persistent opposition to Trump, meaning that their odds of retaking the chamber are considerably higher than in the Senate.International Talk Like a Pirate Day 2018: All you need to knowWho is Orla Kiely?

We are so used to the likes of Rod Steward on a carefully choreographed airport stroll (for the press, naturally) complete with loving wife holding his hand, (she probably selected his on-trend Gucci slippers), perfectly pressed trousers and precisely ruffled hair, that Johnny Lydon’s tramp-like persona comes a bit of a rude reality check.

This is what sixty-something men look like when they can drink large amounts of beer without a partner giving them the ‘forget it’ stare. This is what men of a certain age look like when they are away from home and can eat the crap they really like (fast food full of grease and carbs- which is all you can get anyway at 11pm after a gig and you’ve signed hundreds of autographs and posed for selfies).John does look as if touring with his band and publicising a new documentary (The Public Image is Rotten) has impacted on his waistline. It might have expanded but I very much doubt there’s be much change in his mental outlook- this isn’t someone who is going to turn into a docile pensioner any day soon.We met back over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge. It was early days- the band sounded appalling, and their performance came to an abrupt end when the PA system failed. The road crew started to fight with the sound technicians and I left before it got nasty.That autumn, I made a television documentary about the rise of Punk Rock, filming the Clash and then the Sex Pistols- it was to be their first TV appearance. I tried to film an interview with John in a squat in Soho and got a stuffed rat chucked at my head as he spouted ‘I don’t have no heroes, they’re all useless’. What an anthem for anyone under 21, back in the days when Maggie Thatcher was leader of the Tory party and the British government was male, middle aged and mediocre- not to mention white.          Janet Street-Porter\u0027s television documentary gave Johnny Rotten his first television exposureThat footage has now been shown around the world, along with the Sex Pistols’ performance in a church hall we hired for the occasion. Lydon’s stage presence was simply electrifying- and Elton John rang me one Sunday, asking to meet to discuss the revolution that was going on in pop music. Elton was totally bowled over by punk, realising that nothing in pop would be the same again.John Lydon didn’t just take on the establishment with hits like God Save the Queen, his alternative National Anthem (which topped the charts in the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Year in 1977) and Anarchy in the UK, he sent shock waves through the world of popular music- he mouthed off about Queen and ‘pomp’ rock, played in a pubs and small village halls where kids could get up close- everything mega stars like Rod Stewart had left behind long ago.          John Lydon aka Jonny Rotten performing with The Sex Pistols in 1977I’ve known him through three of my marriages, while he’s always been devoted to one partner for almost 40 years. Nora has been his rock and his soul mate, a woman who shuns the limelight and gets on with her life. A man of many contradictions, a shy sensitive soul who carefully keeps that aspect of his personality hidden, a loud mouth who can terrify any hard-bitten interviewer with one withering F*** off. From Vogue to your local newspaper, he doesn’t discriminate, but behind that belligerent façade lurks a highly intelligent bloke.At my 50th birthday guests like Stephen Fry, Ruby Wax and Ian McKellen and the boss of the BBC all queued up to be insulted by the king of Punk. What an inspiration.

Nobody really understood what I was doing or wanted, and they were like, “That’s crazy – I would never go on camera and say that”.‘But if you’re there – and I’d say I was there three days a week probably for four years – you’re around (not that I stayed at the hotel, but I was around the hotel, in the lobby and getting to know people.) And once you’ve become familiar, people open up, and they tell you stories off-camera – and then they agree to go on camera.’And some of the people he got to agree to interviews are more than familiar with being in front of – or even behind – the lens: box office names like Naomi Campbell, George Clooney, Harrison Ford, Jon Hamm, Anjelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones, Lenny Kravitz, and Wes Anderson all happily shared their experiences at the hotel, good-naturedly bantering about the place, the staff and the Carlyle’s embodiment of an old-world class that is so quickly disappearing in today’s society.‘It has a unique, unique heritage,’ designer Vera Wang says in the film. ‘As a native New Yorker, there’s really nothing that is more emblematic of elegance, history, romance, scandal than the Carlyle.’The late Anthony Bourdain – who Miele believes died before seeing the finished film – similarly gushes: ‘I stay in many different type of hotels, and I’m reasonably happy in a lot of them, but we’re talking about love like someone you fall in love with, it’s the eccentricities you embrace as much as everything, if not more so.’He later adds: ‘It’s like you’re holding your breath: How much longer can this exist? It’s completely awesome and frankly nuts.’The staff discuss the hotel with a mixture of pride and reverence, whether a doorman named Ernesto is explaining how Jack Nicholson, one of the favorite guests, refused to pose for paparazzi unless the doorman joined him in the pic – or elevator operator Allen laughing about how he was once cast as the lead in an off- off-Broadway play in which Bruce Willis was an extra (the story made for an amusing exchange when Willis and his family stepped into the elevator Allen was operating.)

Trump, one cheeky bellman named Danny concedes after significant prodding, allegedly once disparaged the Carlyle, sniffing: ‘This place is a joke’. It’s about the only twinge of negativity in the documentary, which even interviews the children of a former manager who spent their youth growing up at the Carlyle and Donald Ginsburg, the grandson of builder Moses Ginsburg, who conceived of the hotel in 1930.‘My grandfather included his daughters in everything he did, even though the women never worked in the business,’ Ginsburg says in the film, adding that his aunt Diana chose the hotel’s name because she was reading and enjoying Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle.The Carlyle enjoyed its upsurge in popularity under the ownership of hotelier Peter Sharp, who bought the property in 1967 and whose family were real estate magnates in the city.‘My dad recognized that there was a need, at that time, that people who were coming to New York who were socially connected, as well as connected in business, didn’t want to stay down at the St Regis,’ his son, also named Peter, says in the film. ‘They didn’t want to stay at the Plaza, which was a zoo. They were usually here for relatively long periods of time, and they wanted to stay where their friends lived – and the Carlyle really became their second home.’He praises his father’s attention to and insistence on detail, saying: ‘I did learn that, the ability to walk into a room – it’s almost Conan Doyle-ish, in the sense of being able to pick out 15 things wrong in a room. My dad could do that in spades. He would say … this was imbued into us: “Even though the guest doesn’t see it, they see it.”’           In addition to being an iconic feature of the Manhattan skyline, the hotel became an alternative to busier establishments such as the St. Moritz or Plaza hotels, the son of former owner Peter Sharp says in the documentary, adding that his father was \u0027almost Conan Doyle-ish, in the sense of being able to pick out 15 things wrong in a room.

Entertainment has included everyone from long-time performer Bobby Short to Eartha Kitt to, more recently, Alexa Ray Joel, daughter of Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley, and Woody Allen, who regularly plays clarinet at the establishment.The ambience and artistry at the hotel even inspired a new generation of talent, as revealed by Lenny Kravitz – in yet another Carlyle connection of which the filmmakers were completely unaware before the project began.‘I’ve been coming to the Carlyle since I was about three or four years old,’ Kravitz says on camera he grew up just blocks away from the hotel and his parents were very friendly with Bobby Short.‘I was brought to this room as a small child, made to put on a suit, which I didn’t like, as I remember it was very itchy. And I used to sit in this room and listen to Bobby Short,’ he says. ‘I didn’t really get it, and you’re in a room full of adults and it’s quiet it’s dark … but one day, I got it. I understood it, and I fell in love with Bobby and this room.’He says: ‘This would be a place where I would bring a date, like: Let me see if this girl can hang, if she understands this and enjoys it. And if I brought a girl here and she liked it, it was very major for me.’He later adds: ‘It’s definitely been a fantasy of mine to be on this stage and to grace this institution … not yet, but it’ll happen.’Filmmaker Wes Anderson, for once on the other side of the camera, says in his interview that he, too, equates the Carlyle with dating.‘The first time I came to the Carlyle, it was to Bemelmans Bar,’ he says. ‘I actually was on a date, and I’d been told to go here – and I think it made me look good. I actually didn’t know the place, but when I walked in, I thought: This is good. This is a good idea.’He adds: ‘I really spent most of my time kind of creeping around the room, leaning over people’s martinis, staring at these walls. And I thought, I know this artist, but I didn’t know the name.’Is this the best hotel room on the east coast of America?...No wonder the WAGs love it!

Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority.          Mrs May (pictured leaving Downing Street today) called on associations to build more high-quality social housing and urge them to help change attitudes\u0027On the outside, many people in society – including too many politicians – continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.\u0027We should never see social housing as something that need simply be \u0027good enough\u0027, nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better.\u0027Whether it is owned and managed by local authorities, tenant management organisations or housing associations, I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home … our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens.\u0027The new money – which will become available in 2022 – is an attempt to send a signal to housing associations that they can build homes with the confidence Government funding will continue in the long term. As well as encouraging home ownership, Mrs May said she wants to ensure those who cannot afford to buy have somewhere they are proud to live.Housing associations should \u0027lead major developments\u0027 instead of just taking a share of private sector projects, she argued.Mrs Thatcher\u0027s right-to-buy allowed hundreds of thousands of council house tenants to buy their homes at a discount.          Theresa May was last week pictured watching The Chase with husband Phillip, at Chequers. BBC producers filmed the \u0027a day in the life\u0027 documentary for an episode of Panorama. Mrs May will say politicians should never see social housing as \u0027something that need simply be good enough\u0027Under David Cameron the Tories proposed extending this to housing association tenants, a pledge shelved after the 2015 election.Housing association chiefs have urged ministers to give them long-term funding. Mrs May will point out that eight associations have already been handed deals worth almost £600million.She will say the new money \u0027will give you the stability you need to get tens of thousands of affordable and social homes built where they are needed most\u0027.David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said: \u0027The announcement of £2billion of new money for social housing is extremely welcome – but the really big news here is the Prime Minister\u0027s long-term commitment to funding new affordable homes. This represents a total step change. \u0027For years, the way that money was allocated meant housing associations couldn\u0027t be sure of long-term funding to build much-needed affordable housing.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/11/05937BC9000007D0-0-The_Prime_Minister_pictured_at_the_EU_Council_in_June_has_made_c-a-3_1537265559498.jpg","title":"Captain James Cooks HMS Endeavour finally nearly 250 years Australian voyage","story":"    Marine archaeologists believe they have pinpointed the exact place where the scuttled remains of Captain James Cook\u0027s HMS Endeavour ship (a replica of the ship is pictured) are located          Captain James Cook (pictured) commanded the HMS Endeavour to Australia during his voyage of discovery in the late 1700sThe Friday announcement will involve archaeologists from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANNM).\u0027The event will review how the 25-year-long archaeological study of the Newport transports has narrowed the search for the Endeavour from a fleet of thirteen vessels to five and now possibly to one or two archaeological sites,\u0027 a statement posted on the RIMAP website said.\u0027RIMAP and the ANMM researchers will discuss the 2018 fieldwork results, and release to the public a 3-D photogrammetric image of a promising site located in the Limited Study Area, just off the Goat Island shore near Gurneys Resort.\u0027The identification of the vessel\u0027s final resting place has raised hopes the HMS Endeavour will be able to be excavated next year.   From a Japanese tea party to camping on the Great Plains......Solar-powered yacht capable of sailing around the world...Share this articleDirector of RIMAP, Kathy Abbass, said the discovery would be significant for a number of countries, including Australia, the US, Britain and New Zealand.  \u0027It is exciting, we are closing in,\u0027 she told Fairfax Media. The latest development comes after the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project made an important discovery, saying the ship was scuttled in Newport Harbor in 1778 by British forces in the lead up to the Battle of Rhode Island.The HMS Endeavour was then discovered to be among 13 other ships in a massive archaeological investigation that combined high-tech mapping of the seabed with analysis of historical shipping documents found in London.           The event will take place on Goat Island, a small island in Narragansett Bay, off Newport, Rhode Island, near to where the scuttled remains are believed to be located          Pictured, a replica of the HMS Endeavour. The HMS Endeavour is one of the most famous ships in naval history and was used for Captain Cook\u0027s discovery of the East Coast of Australia in 1770          This chart from 1893 shows tracked the HMS Endeavour\u0027s journey But the website statement added more detailed work would have to be undertaken.  \u0027Now that RIMAP and the ANMM have identified a possible site in Newport Harbor that might be the Lord Sandwich ex Endeavour, the detailed work must begin to prove it,\u0027 it said.             The HMS Endeavour is one of the most famous ships in naval history and was used for Captain Cook\u0027s discovery of the East Coast of Australia in 1770.The last sighting of the HMS Endeavour was around 1778 when it is believed the ship was sold, renamed the Lord Sandwich, and then used to transport British troops during the American Revolution. The HMS Endeavour was first launched in 1764 as the Earl of Pembroke, and then renamed His Majesty\u0027s Bark the Endeavour after it was purchased four years later by the British Royal Navy.

Pictured, the Earl of Pembroke leaving Whitby Harbour in 1768It was sent out to explore the Pacific Ocean in August 1768 both to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun and in the search for the continent which was then called Terra Australis Incognita, or unknown Southern land.The previous transit of Venus in 1639 had provided a vast amount of the information astronomers and scientists had about the size of the solar system and universe. The ship departed from Plymouth with 94 people on board, including Captain James Cook.It traveled down the coast of Africa before cutting across the Atlantic and arriving in Rio de Janeiro in November of that year.The boat then set out to round Cape Horn, which it managed to do on its third attempt in January after wind, stormy weather and difficult conditions foiled Cook\u0027s first two attempts.          Captain James Cook is pictured arriving at Queen Charlotte\u0027s Sound in New Zealand, in this A print from an oil painting attributed to J Clevely In April the ship reached Tahiti, where it stayed for the next four months and where astronomer Charles Green was able to study the transit of Venus in June.After months exploring the Pacific for islands, the Endeavour reached the coast of New Zealand in October, becoming the first European vessel to land on the island in over 100 years.Dutch explorer Abel Tasman had previously reached the islands of New Zealand and Tasmania during his 1642 journey while with the Dutch East India Company.Cook spent six months exploring and mapping the coast of New Zealand and claimed the land for Great Britain before sailing west.In April of 1770 iniduals on the ship first spotted Australia, and on April 29 the HMS Endeavour became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of the island.Cook spent four months charting the coast and at one point ran into trouble when the ship struck part of the Great Barrier Reef.The ship was 24 miles off the coast at the time with not enough life boats, but managed to clear the water from the hull of the ship and make its way safely back to shore.

Advertising posters from the Soviet-era have not been taken down          It looks like a monolithic space-city straight out of science fiction. In reality it was one of the jewels in the Soviet crown, but now even the lettering on the side of the tower is peeling          The architecture is of distinct Soviet-era design and was meant to impress the Kremlin VIPs and visitors from all over the USSR who touched down on its runway           No longer maintained, the abandoned offices are scattered with papers. Once important, they are now simply rubbishNow stepping inside Zvartnots, once the crossroads of Europe and Asia, is like being transported back four decades. The grand entrance hall and the soaring concrete and marble walls are now crumbling. The cracked ceiling is leaking, and the runway viewing windows are broken or missing.But British architects are leading international calls for it to be saved from the wrecking ball. These exclusive photographs show the iconic revolutionary building and capture the last pictures of its ghostly interior.Armenia was incorporated into the Soviet Union along with Georgia and Azerbaijan in 1922. Soviet Armenia\u0027s economy transformed in this period from a predominantly agricultural one into an industrial success.          After it was built in the 1970s, more than 2,500 passengers crowded through the country\u0027s most modern airport terminal every hour          Today the escalators are silent and broken and the heating system doesn\u0027t work. Stubs of old tickets to Moscow and beyond lie strewn on the dusty floor.In the post-war period the country\u0027s economic development further expanded to include military engineering, radio-electronics and an car industry and the Soviet Union centred a considerable part of their military electronic production and scientific research projects in production there. However in 1988, a democratic movement was set up in Armenia which demanded the return of disputed Karabakh territory which had been given to Azerbaijan by Stalin.  The Karabakh movement\u0027s success eventually led to Armenia\u0027s break from the Soviet Union in August 1990, a year before the collapse of the USSR, Armenia declared its independence.          Stubs of old tickets to Moscow and beyond lie strewn on the dusty floor           The baggage carousels lie frozen and gathering a thick layer of dust from the moment the airport saw its last flight in 2008Armenia\u0027s prime minister quits following 11 days of protests...Armenian-Americans flood the streets of Los Angeles as they...Share this articleLeading British architect Tim Flynn says the airport is an outstanding piece of architecture. His London-based international practice has had an office in Yerevan for 14 years.And he hopes that the new, more democratic government in Armenia which came to power after May\u0027s Velvet Revolution will decide Zvartnots is a historical building worth preserving.And yet he warns the longer it\u0027s left to crumble away, the chances of saving it diminish.\u0027I realise the new prime minister has a lot on his plate, but I hope his conscience will lead to a change of plan. Whatever you think of the old Soviet Union, the buildings from this period were extraordinary and adventurous, a piece of history.\u0027Inside Zvartnots, the baggage carousels lie frozen at the moment the airport saw its last flight in 2008. By then the Soviet empire had collapsed and Armenia was an independent country.Today the escalators are silent and the heating system broken down. Stubs of old tickets to Moscow and beyond lie strewn on the dusty floor.          The grand entrance hall and the soaring concrete and marble walls are now crumbling. The lifts are quiet and the whole place is eerie          Alongside derelict check-in desks and security machines, old signs for trolley hire, shopping, and the city-centre hang forlornly in the grim half-lightAlongside derelict check-in desks and security machines, old signs for trolley hire, shopping, and the city-centre hang forlornly in the grim half-light.Abandoned offices are scattered with papers, once important, now simply rubbish.Maintenance manager Karen Torosyan shows us round by flashlight, up and down dark concrete stairways. He said: \u0027This airport was the best of its kind. When I worked here it was always busy. It\u0027s sad to see it like this, but time moves on. A road flyover and some metal bridges connecting arrivals and departures, have already been pulled down. They were in a dangerous condition.\u0027The owners want to demolish more of the old airport to make way for a multi-million pound expansion of the new international terminal. But they are being fought by the daughter of the original airport architect.          Rubbish is strewn across the floor, the remains of now-outdated electrical devices and the windows are covered in dirt          Anahit Tarkhanyan believes the airport still has huge potential and that many don\u0027t realise what they\u0027re giving up.  She says land-locked Armenia  could benefit from a new renovated airport which could become the centre of a network of regional airports          Anahit Tarkhanyan\u0027s, whose father Artur, was part of the team that made the original terminal, is running for mayor of Yerevan, with a mission to fight the demolition          Clem Cecil, of SAVE Europe\u0027s Heritage and director of London\u0027s Pushkin House, the Russian cultural centre, said the terminal has been under-appreciated and should be saved Anahit Tarkhanyan\u0027s father, Artur, was part of a prize-winning team that made the original Zvartnots terminal a symbol of Armenia, featured on postcards and tourist brochures.Now Anahit is running for mayor of Yerevan, with a mission to fight the demolition. \u0027The airport has been stolen from the people. It\u0027s part of our heritage and history, but many don\u0027t realise what they\u0027re giving up. We\u0027re a land-locked country with poor roads. The old airport could be renovated to be the centre of a network of regional airports. We\u0027ve got the backing of international architects, including British.\u0027The airport was truly revolutionary – it was just 15 metres from your car to the plane. There was a special underground luggage delivery system, and a plane refuelling pipe that ran round the airport, emerging at the underbelly of each aircraft. Unheard of in 1976.          The original arrivals balcony looked down on waiting families below and were designed to create very emotional homecomings for Armenians          The owners want to demolish more of the old airport to make way for a multi-million pound expansion of the new international terminal          The Zvartnots building is a classic of its kind and part of the unique history and culture of Armenia. It was built in an era when Soviet architects were experimenting with international influences\u0027Also, in Soviet times everything was regulated – even the thickness of the paint on the wall. But my father got round all that by always leaving room in his designs for later expansion.\u0027Most of all, he designed for the people. Armenians are scattered all over the world, so for homecomings he made sure the arrivals balcony looked down on waiting families below. It was all very emotional.\u0027Clem Cecil, of SAVE Europe\u0027s Heritage and director of London\u0027s Pushkin House, the Russian cultural centre, said: \u0027The Zvartnots building is a classic of its kind – it should be saved. It was built in a period when Stalin\u0027s grip had been broken and Soviet architects were experimenting with international influences.She added: \u0027Zvartnots is very cutting edge and reflects the excitement of the times. The problem is it\u0027s been under-appreciated and vulnerable. The fact there\u0027s a growing effort to save it is good news. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/15/504D1FBA00000578-0-image-a-52_1537194775369.jpg","title":"Footy players disgrace donning blackface","story":"    Three Australian amateur league football players (pictured) have painted their bodies black in a shocking case of Blackface for their club\u0027s Mad Monday celebrationThe image was shared online to a Facebook page where costumes from Mad Mondays across the country were regularly featured.Mr Grundy posted the photo to the page with the caption, \u0027William sisters and Aliir Aliir #MadMonday\u0027.Controversial feminist Germaine Greer compares rape to a...Mad Monday saga reaches new low: Claims Bulldogs stars...REVEALED: Woman who claims Rabbitohs stars flashed her on...Two Rabbitohs players investigated over claims they exposed...Share this articleAliir was the first Sudanese player to be selected NAB AFL National Draft and the second to make an AFL list after North Melbourne\u0027s Majak Daw.The controversial photo came a week after a \u0027disgustingly racist\u0027 cartoon of Serena Williams being published in the Herald Sun.

Pictured:  The couple together on the set of Hooper in 1978              The Oscar-winning actress (pictured on Monday) has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died on September 6 aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoirField has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died earlier this month aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoir. And now that the book is out, it is clear what she meant.Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14.Field describes how being with Reynolds was \u0027exorcising something that needed to be exorcised\u0027 but she was \u0027trying to make it work this time\u0027.The actress writes that from the beginning Reynolds was presumptuous and arrogant, introducing himself as \u0027Burt Reynolds, movie star\u0027 when he called her. It was 1976 and he had asked her to star in Smokey and the Bandit she had already found fame with films like Gidget and Stay Hungry, while Reynolds was the biggest star in the world at the time, thanks to films like Deliverance.Field writes she did not understand why Reynolds wanted her in the film because she was not his typical leading lady and she thought that the \u0027script stinks\u0027.But his motives became clear when, to her surprise, he announced they were going on a date for their first meeting.Field writes: \u0027By the time we met, the weight of his stardom had become a way for Burt to control everyone around him, and from the moment I walked through the door, it was a way to control me. We were a perfect match of flaws\u0027.Their affair was \u0027instantaneous and intense\u0027, Field writes.          Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.          Field learned not to talk about previous lovers and later became \u0027terrified\u0027 of running into any man she knew, regardless of whether or not she was in a relationship with him priorDuring the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.Field writes: \u0027This could not have been a good thing and I couldn\u0027t understand why everyone around him acted so nonchalant while this man was writhing in pain, panicked that his heart was about to stop\u0027.Field gave Reynolds a brown paper bag to breathe into and wrapped hot towels around his feet, face and hands. Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist.

If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/16/4EABD51300000578-0-image-m-17_1533136441030.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Lets salute King Punk John Lydon letting hang out","story":"    Janet Street-Porter met John Lydon over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge          janet Street Porter and Johnny Rotten in 1978.

I can hear the howls of pain emanating from ageing former punks all over the world, the devotees who still keep their ripped tee shirts and Sex Pistols memorabilia carefully folded in boxes. They put on Anarchy In the UK and re-live those happy days of 1976, the hours spent chucking yourself into the mosh pit front of the stage at Sex Pistols gigs, only to get covered in a large amount of spit.JANET STREET-PORTER: If boys are growing up to become...JANET STREET-PORTER: With their broken Heathrow promises,...Share this articleNaturally, critics have sneered that the King of Punk looks ‘shockingly unrecognisable’ as if he must be on permanent stand-by on to pop on a multi-coloured tartan suit and strut his stuff for a Vivienne Westwood fashion show or a highly paid butter commercial. We are so used to the likes of Rod Steward on a carefully choreographed airport stroll (for the press, naturally) complete with loving wife holding his hand, (she probably selected his on-trend Gucci slippers), perfectly pressed trousers and precisely ruffled hair, that Johnny Lydon’s tramp-like persona comes a bit of a rude reality check.          Sex Pistols\u0027 John Lydon aka Johnny Rotten, 62, waits for his luggage at LAX airport in Los Angeles, California          Given his personality, recent photos of the King of Punk looking rather overweight at LA airport, slumped next to his battered wheelie case are bound to be dismissed as a ‘whatever’ moment, says JANET STREET-PORTER          This is what men of a certain age look like when they are away from home and can eat the crap they really like, says JANET STREET-PORTERWake up everyone! This is what sixty-something men look like when they can drink large amounts of beer without a partner giving them the ‘forget it’ stare. This is what men of a certain age look like when they are away from home and can eat the crap they really like (fast food full of grease and carbs- which is all you can get anyway at 11pm after a gig and you’ve signed hundreds of autographs and posed for selfies).John does look as if touring with his band and publicising a new documentary (The Public Image is Rotten) has impacted on his waistline. It might have expanded but I very much doubt there’s be much change in his mental outlook- this isn’t someone who is going to turn into a docile pensioner any day soon.We met back over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge. It was early days- the band sounded appalling, and their performance came to an abrupt end when the PA system failed. The road crew started to fight with the sound technicians and I left before it got nasty.That autumn, I made a television documentary about the rise of Punk Rock, filming the Clash and then the Sex Pistols- it was to be their first TV appearance. I tried to film an interview with John in a squat in Soho and got a stuffed rat chucked at my head as he spouted ‘I don’t have no heroes, they’re all useless’. What an anthem for anyone under 21, back in the days when Maggie Thatcher was leader of the Tory party and the British government was male, middle aged and mediocre- not to mention white.          Janet Street-Porter\u0027s television documentary gave Johnny Rotten his first television exposureThat footage has now been shown around the world, along with the Sex Pistols’ performance in a church hall we hired for the occasion. Lydon’s stage presence was simply electrifying- and Elton John rang me one Sunday, asking to meet to discuss the revolution that was going on in pop music. Elton was totally bowled over by punk, realising that nothing in pop would be the same again.John Lydon didn’t just take on the establishment with hits like God Save the Queen, his alternative National Anthem (which topped the charts in the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Year in 1977) and Anarchy in the UK, he sent shock waves through the world of popular music- he mouthed off about Queen and ‘pomp’ rock, played in a pubs and small village halls where kids could get up close- everything mega stars like Rod Stewart had left behind long ago.          John Lydon aka Jonny Rotten performing with The Sex Pistols in 1977I’ve known him through three of my marriages, while he’s always been devoted to one partner for almost 40 years. Nora has been his rock and his soul mate, a woman who shuns the limelight and gets on with her life. A man of many contradictions, a shy sensitive soul who carefully keeps that aspect of his personality hidden, a loud mouth who can terrify any hard-bitten interviewer with one withering F*** off. From Vogue to your local newspaper, he doesn’t discriminate, but behind that belligerent façade lurks a highly intelligent bloke.At my 50th birthday guests like Stephen Fry, Ruby Wax and Ian McKellen and the boss of the BBC all queued up to be insulted by the king of Punk. What an inspiration. Let’s raise a glass to John Lydon, for proudly letting it all hang out in sweat pants."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/19/14/5060084900000578-6182079-Jackie_Kennedy_was_a_frequent_guest_of_and_visitor_to_the_hotel_-a-1_1537364874200.jpg","title":"Behind scenes New Yorks famously discreet Carlyle Hotel host princesses presidents","story":"    The Carlyle Hotel, on Manhattan\u0027s Upper East Side, was built in 1930 and became particularly popular with high society during the 1960s and 1970s under the leadership of owner Peter Sharp the rich and famous continue to frequent the spot          Jackie Kennedy was a frequent guest of and visitor to the hotel, often enjoying lunch of a Cobb salad and a gin and tonic drink every president since Truman has been to The Carlyle          The Carlyle was also a favorite of Princess Diana in a new film about the hotel, Piers Morgan tells a story about a legendary Carlyle elevator journey shared by Princess Diana, Michael Jackson and Steve Jobs - in which Princess Di breaks the silence by singing Jackson\u0027s \u0027Beat It\u0027‘It was not easy,’ he laughs. ‘I was persona non grata for, I would say, at least a year and a half. Nobody really understood what I was doing or wanted, and they were like, “That’s crazy – I would never go on camera and say that”.‘But if you’re there – and I’d say I was there three days a week probably for four years – you’re around (not that I stayed at the hotel, but I was around the hotel, in the lobby and getting to know people.) And once you’ve become familiar, people open up, and they tell you stories off-camera – and then they agree to go on camera.’And some of the people he got to agree to interviews are more than familiar with being in front of – or even behind – the lens: box office names like Naomi Campbell, George Clooney, Harrison Ford, Jon Hamm, Anjelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones, Lenny Kravitz, and Wes Anderson all happily shared their experiences at the hotel, good-naturedly bantering about the place, the staff and the Carlyle’s embodiment of an old-world class that is so quickly disappearing in today’s society.‘It has a unique, unique heritage,’ designer Vera Wang says in the film. ‘As a native New Yorker, there’s really nothing that is more emblematic of elegance, history, romance, scandal than the Carlyle.’The late Anthony Bourdain – who Miele believes died before seeing the finished film – similarly gushes: ‘I stay in many different type of hotels, and I’m reasonably happy in a lot of them, but we’re talking about love like someone you fall in love with, it’s the eccentricities you embrace as much as everything, if not more so.’He later adds: ‘It’s like you’re holding your breath: How much longer can this exist? It’s completely awesome and frankly nuts.’The staff discuss the hotel with a mixture of pride and reverence, whether a doorman named Ernesto is explaining how Jack Nicholson, one of the favorite guests, refused to pose for paparazzi unless the doorman joined him in the pic – or elevator operator Allen laughing about how he was once cast as the lead in an off- off-Broadway play in which Bruce Willis was an extra (the story made for an amusing exchange when Willis and his family stepped into the elevator Allen was operating.)    Another long-time guest is George Clooney, who happily shares his memories of and fondness for the hotel in filmmaker Matthew Miele\u0027s documentary Always at The Carlyle, revealing that his wife, Amal, loves the hotel, as well  Celebrities such as Rihanna, left, and Priyanka Chopra, right, flock to The Carlyle each year on the evening of the Met Gala the hotel is a hopping after-party location for the eventEvery president since Truman has visited the Carlyle, and one of the now-retired bartenders - who began working at the hotel in 1958 – recalls on film how Truman was one of his first customers. John F. Kennedy was rumored to have slipped Marilyn Monroe in through a network of tunnels. Donald J. Trump, one cheeky bellman named Danny concedes after significant prodding, allegedly once disparaged the Carlyle, sniffing: ‘This place is a joke’. It’s about the only twinge of negativity in the documentary, which even interviews the children of a former manager who spent their youth growing up at the Carlyle and Donald Ginsburg, the grandson of builder Moses Ginsburg, who conceived of the hotel in 1930.‘My grandfather included his daughters in everything he did, even though the women never worked in the business,’ Ginsburg says in the film, adding that his aunt Diana chose the hotel’s name because she was reading and enjoying Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle.The Carlyle enjoyed its upsurge in popularity under the ownership of hotelier Peter Sharp, who bought the property in 1967 and whose family were real estate magnates in the city.‘My dad recognized that there was a need, at that time, that people who were coming to New York who were socially connected, as well as connected in business, didn’t want to stay down at the St Regis,’ his son, also named Peter, says in the film. ‘They didn’t want to stay at the Plaza, which was a zoo. They were usually here for relatively long periods of time, and they wanted to stay where their friends lived – and the Carlyle really became their second home.’He praises his father’s attention to and insistence on detail, saying: ‘I did learn that, the ability to walk into a room – it’s almost Conan Doyle-ish, in the sense of being able to pick out 15 things wrong in a room. My dad could do that in spades. He would say … this was imbued into us: “Even though the guest doesn’t see it, they see it.”’           In addition to being an iconic feature of the Manhattan skyline, the hotel became an alternative to busier establishments such as the St. Moritz or Plaza hotels, the son of former owner Peter Sharp says in the documentary, adding that his father was \u0027almost Conan Doyle-ish, in the sense of being able to pick out 15 things wrong in a room.

Entertainment has included everyone from long-time performer Bobby Short to Eartha Kitt to, more recently, Alexa Ray Joel, daughter of Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley, and Woody Allen, who regularly plays clarinet at the establishment.The ambience and artistry at the hotel even inspired a new generation of talent, as revealed by Lenny Kravitz – in yet another Carlyle connection of which the filmmakers were completely unaware before the project began.‘I’ve been coming to the Carlyle since I was about three or four years old,’ Kravitz says on camera he grew up just blocks away from the hotel and his parents were very friendly with Bobby Short.‘I was brought to this room as a small child, made to put on a suit, which I didn’t like, as I remember it was very itchy. And I used to sit in this room and listen to Bobby Short,’ he says. ‘I didn’t really get it, and you’re in a room full of adults and it’s quiet it’s dark … but one day, I got it. I understood it, and I fell in love with Bobby and this room.’He says: ‘This would be a place where I would bring a date, like: Let me see if this girl can hang, if she understands this and enjoys it. And if I brought a girl here and she liked it, it was very major for me.’He later adds: ‘It’s definitely been a fantasy of mine to be on this stage and to grace this institution … not yet, but it’ll happen.’Filmmaker Wes Anderson, for once on the other side of the camera, says in his interview that he, too, equates the Carlyle with dating.‘The first time I came to the Carlyle, it was to Bemelmans Bar,’ he says. ‘I actually was on a date, and I’d been told to go here – and I think it made me look good. I actually didn’t know the place, but when I walked in, I thought: This is good. This is a good idea.’He adds: ‘I really spent most of my time kind of creeping around the room, leaning over people’s martinis, staring at these walls. And I thought, I know this artist, but I didn’t know the name.’Is this the best hotel room on the east coast of America?...No wonder the WAGs love it!

More than 40,000 people in the UK are thought to die early every year because of air pollution.Earlier this week, scientists revealed they had found tiny particles of vehicle soot in the wombs of pregnant women, suggesting even unborn babies are at risk.The lead author of the new research, Professor Frank Kelly, calculated 7 per cent of cases of dementia could be attributed to air pollution. If applied to the 850,000 cases in the UK, his figures suggest 60,000 cases could be prevented if air pollution was eradicated.Professor Kelly, of King\u0027s College London and a government adviser on air pollution, said: \u0027This is a very serious problem. The more we look at all the chronic diseases in society, the more air pollution crops up as a recurring factor.\u0027We\u0027re not saying air pollution is the only cause of dementia. But by tackling air pollution, even if you merely delayed the onset of dementia, that would be of enormous benefit for families and the health service.\u0027The research team, whose findings were published in the BMJ Open medical journal last night, tracked 131,000 people aged 50 to 79 living within Greater London, and followed them for seven years.Using participants\u0027 postcodes, they looked at air pollution data and compared it to their health records. They found people living in the most polluted areas were far more likely to develop dementia.          As part of the study 131,000 people aged 50 to 79 living in the Greater London area were analysedThose living in areas with the highest 20 per cent of nitrogen dioxide emissions had a 40 per cent increased dementia risk. Diesel cars – particularly the older models – produce far more nitrogen dioxide than petrol vehicles.The scientists also found that people with the highest 20 per cent exposure to microscopic sooty particles – also linked to diesel – had a 26 per cent increased risk of dementia.Professor Kelly, who chairs the Department of Health\u0027s committee on the medical effects of air pollution, said: \u0027On the road, older diesel vehicles are by far the most polluting. It\u0027s not just cars – it\u0027s the buses and the taxis.\u0027Although the study focused only on people living within the M25, experts are convinced it is representative of the whole country.A wipe with a face cloth instead of a shower, unable to see...\u0027We realised things weren¿t going to be fine\u0027: Wife whose...Share this articleThe UK is notoriously bad at controlling air pollution, with 37 cities persistently displaying illegal levels and the Government repeatedly being hauled into court over the past few years.Simon Alcock, of environmental law firm ClientEarth, said: \u0027Air pollution is damaging our health from the womb to old age. It is unacceptable in 2018 for people to be risking dementia just by breathing. We need big, bold action from the Government to clean up the air and protect our health.\u0027The microscopic particles in air pollution are breathed deep into the lungs and enter the blood stream. Scientists believe they then travel into the brain where they provoke inflammation – a problem which may trigger dementia.          Several car giants including BMW, Mercedes and VW among others are being investigated over the emissions technologyThe commission said it would examine whether the group agreed to avoid competing against each other in the race to install \u0027clean emission devices\u0027 in diesel and petrol cars sold throughout Europe.Emissions-cutting devices are expensive and push up the cost of building cars, meaning there would have been a financial incentive for manufacturers to drag their heels.The European commission said if car makers did conspire with each other, this would amount to a breach of the EU\u0027s anti-trust rules which outlaw cartels.Commissioner Margrethe Vestager added: \u0027If proven, this collusion may have denied consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars, despite the technology being available to the manufacturers.\u0027VW, Daimler and BMW said they would continue to co-operate with the commission\u0027s investigation but could not comment on the ongoing case.                                                    \u0027Greater investment is also needed in alternatives to motor vehicles, such as safer cycling infrastructure, and affordable and convenient public transport.\u0027But Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer\u0027s Society, pointed out that the research had looked only at the chance of developing dementia, and had not actually proved that the pollution had caused the illness. \u0027There is evidence that exposure to air pollution can cause small particles to enter the brain, but it\u0027s a huge leap to say that air pollution could lead to dementia and this study had several limitations,\u0027 he said.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u0027Air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and while air quality has improved significantly since 2010, we recognise there is more to do.\u0027This is why we have put in place a £3.5 billion plan to reduce harmful emissions from road transport and have launched an ambitious Clean Air Strategy which has been commended by the World Health Organisation.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/16/4F974A7800000578-0-image-m-24_1535814600374.jpg","title":"100m backlash begins against Unilevers bid close UK HQ","story":"Unilever´s offices on Victoria Embankment in London It was also feared the move could land British investors with a £100million foreign tax grab.Last night NFU Mutual became the first minor shareholder to break cover and oppose the proposal.Unilever – the maker of household favourites like Marmite and Persil – wants to sever its links to Britain which have endured since Victorian times.The change needs the backing of 75 per cent of investors who own shares through the London Stock Exchange at a crunch vote next month.M\u0026ampG – which looks after £285.8billion of savers\u0027 cash and sponsors the Chelsea Flower Show – hit out at Unilever\u0027s failure to consult shareholders. Head of corporate finance, Rupert Krefting, said: \u0027We do not support Unilever\u0027s proposal to redomicile to the Netherlands as the company has not adequately persuaded UK shareholders.\u0027The traditional cuppa is going down the drain!

Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority.          Mrs May (pictured leaving Downing Street today) called on associations to build more high-quality social housing and urge them to help change attitudes\u0027On the outside, many people in society – including too many politicians – continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.\u0027We should never see social housing as something that need simply be \u0027good enough\u0027, nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better.\u0027Whether it is owned and managed by local authorities, tenant management organisations or housing associations, I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home … our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens.\u0027The new money – which will become available in 2022 – is an attempt to send a signal to housing associations that they can build homes with the confidence Government funding will continue in the long term. As well as encouraging home ownership, Mrs May said she wants to ensure those who cannot afford to buy have somewhere they are proud to live.Housing associations should \u0027lead major developments\u0027 instead of just taking a share of private sector projects, she argued.Mrs Thatcher\u0027s right-to-buy allowed hundreds of thousands of council house tenants to buy their homes at a discount.

Pictured, the Earl of Pembroke leaving Whitby Harbour in 1768It was sent out to explore the Pacific Ocean in August 1768 both to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun and in the search for the continent which was then called Terra Australis Incognita, or unknown Southern land.The previous transit of Venus in 1639 had provided a vast amount of the information astronomers and scientists had about the size of the solar system and universe. The ship departed from Plymouth with 94 people on board, including Captain James Cook.It traveled down the coast of Africa before cutting across the Atlantic and arriving in Rio de Janeiro in November of that year.The boat then set out to round Cape Horn, which it managed to do on its third attempt in January after wind, stormy weather and difficult conditions foiled Cook\u0027s first two attempts.          Captain James Cook is pictured arriving at Queen Charlotte\u0027s Sound in New Zealand, in this A print from an oil painting attributed to J Clevely In April the ship reached Tahiti, where it stayed for the next four months and where astronomer Charles Green was able to study the transit of Venus in June.After months exploring the Pacific for islands, the Endeavour reached the coast of New Zealand in October, becoming the first European vessel to land on the island in over 100 years.Dutch explorer Abel Tasman had previously reached the islands of New Zealand and Tasmania during his 1642 journey while with the Dutch East India Company.Cook spent six months exploring and mapping the coast of New Zealand and claimed the land for Great Britain before sailing west.In April of 1770 iniduals on the ship first spotted Australia, and on April 29 the HMS Endeavour became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of the island.Cook spent four months charting the coast and at one point ran into trouble when the ship struck part of the Great Barrier Reef.The ship was 24 miles off the coast at the time with not enough life boats, but managed to clear the water from the hull of the ship and make its way safely back to shore.

Mansur now weighs some 440lbs, stands almost 6ft tall and eats 45 lbs of food a day.            Best pals: Mr Ivanov and his colleagues are now building a proper enclosure near their airdrome to make sure they can keep Mansur safe          Friendly bear: Mansur licks the hand of one of his protectors who rescued him - twiceAfter recently outgrowing his  enclosure at the Orlovka airdrome, he has been moved to a new temporary home at a larger airdrome.Thanks to support from pilots across Russia, Mr Ivanov is now working on building a new bear permanent enclosure, incorporating a cargo container to make sure he can be moved if needed.\u0027Bears live for 30-40 years, and I am not going to abandon him,\u0027 vowed Mr Ivanov.\u0027I don\u0027t know what is going on to happen at the airdrome in some five years.\u0027But if I have a container, it will be possible to move the bear to any new place and provide the most comfortable adaptation for him.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/15/504426B100000578-0-Christine_Blasey_Ford_is_going_public_with_her_allegation_agains-m-6_1537280431902.jpg","title":"How one couple bought hideous run Victorian house","story":"    Chelsea Dixon and her husband Robert Bühler, 33 and 31, bought the crumbling Victorian terrace house in Shepherd\u0027s Bush, West London, at an October 2015 auction just three days after the birth of their son.

Two ladies on the ground floor were fairly tidy in comparison.\u0027We had to clear all the junk that had been left so we could see the wood from the trees. Then we stripped it back to the bare walls and plasterboard, and removed some old lime plaster that was falling from the ceiling.\u0027           The rubbish-strewn property had not been renovated in up to 30 years, had damp, and housed a drug den on the top floor but is now worth an estimated 3.5million           The house includes a long, open-plan ground floor which, like the rest of the property, has stylish walnut floors.

Upstairs there are four bathrooms in addition to a downstairs loo.A drafty, non-secured side alley was replaced with a larder and a wine room to take advantage of the cool temperatures in that part of the house.            The couple are pictured with their children, Forest and Vada, further towards the front of the house, which contains the living room in an open-plan format           There are four bathrooms in the upstairs of the house, in addition to a downstairs loo.

But my father got round all that by always leaving room in his designs for later expansion.\u0027Most of all, he designed for the people.

This was their farewell to football – and mine too’Football was everything to me in my teenage years. My father and grandfather played, so there was never any question that I would. But when I was offered football scholarships, I turned them down to study the arts. Coming back 20 years later to shoot the game I gave up for photography gave me a rush of nostalgia.This shot is of the Vikings, a high-school team in Phoenix, Arizona. I chose this school because it was like the one I attended, with the same vast array of social, economic and ethnic backgrounds. I spent the whole season with the Vikings, getting to know the boys and their families. I realised how much the game meant to them – and how much it still means to me.This was taken during the warm-up for the final home game of the season, known as seniors’ night. It was the last time they were putting on the pads and playing in front of fans, friends and families. It was pure pageantry: mothers brought flowers and walked the players on. Fathers embraced their sons when the pads came off. Playing football requires a military level of dedication, from parents as much as players, and this was a celebration of that.You can see the teams squaring up to each other. They got into formation, sang their school chants, tried to psych out their opponents. But it wasn’t just about intimidation. This also helped to solidify team identity, building the bonds that can mean the difference between victory and loss.For many of the young men, football offered a sense of identity and belonging they might not find in later life. In today’s political climate, watching kids unite across class and racial ides was especially powerful. But it was also deeply sad. In a school like this, maybe one or two would go on to play football at college, and probably none would play in the national league. This wasn’t just goodbye to high-school football, it was goodbye to the game itself.American football has become a source of controversy, some of it justifiable. Criticism of the kind of masculinity it encourages are legitimate. There’s a dark side to the game that encourages explosive aggression and lavishes praise on players, making them think they’re untouchable. But it’s also one of the few spaces where young men can express emotion. I saw these boys broken, weeping in their fathers’ arms, being vulnerable in public in a way society rarely allows.There has also been a focus on “locker room talk” since the tapes of President Trump leaked, which I think is deeply unfair to locker rooms. These young men were more culturally aware and had higher emotional IQs than my peers and I had at their age. Football might encourage machismo, but it also instils a sense of responsibility not to let team or school down.And the Colin Kaepernick debacle has politicised a game many of us thought was beyond politics. People have rallied behind the idea that taking a knee during the national anthem is somehow un-American. It’s completely ridiculous. As someone who loves the game and loves my country, it’s heartbreaking to see it become yet another source of ision.I think the game will weather those storms, but its future is still under threat. In the last few years, we’ve learned more about football’s impacts on players’ health. It isn’t just the sheer force of collisions. It’s the repetitive nature of the physical trauma. I’ve had shoulder surgery twice, hip surgery, my left knee is going to have to be replaced and my back is ruined. I’m 38, but my body and mind feel older than they should.The more stories I’ve read, the more times I have experienced the long-term effects of the game, the more I’ve realised football won’t be something I pass down to my children. This was a farewell for the players – and a farewell for me.Studied: “Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts, Arizona State University.”Influences: “Nadav Kander has an incredible range and I love Martin Parr’s humour and observational prowess.”Low point: “After the great recession when the phone stopped ringing.”High point: “After the great recession when the phone stopped ringing!

It would be a literary reimagining of their 1979 debut Unknown Pleasures – the only Joy Division album released during singer Ian Curtis’s lifetime – with each author assigned one of the songs and left free to interpret it however they liked. I was intrigued, especially when I was assigned New Dawn Fades, one of my favourites. I hadn’t listened to Unknown Pleasures properly since my difficult teenage years in the Welsh countryside, but I still remember the vertiginous feeling of hearing it for the first time and thinking, knowing, this album will change my life.In those days, Joy Division meant sitting on my overcrowded school bus with my Walkman on my lap, staring at the seat in front of me as I listened, and then walking through the corridors of my school with the music still in my ears. Sometimes I pretended I was in a film, a drama that warranted the oceanic rush of my emotions. It meant listening to the music far too loudly on evenings when my parents were not in the house. We had no neighbours, so I could put it up to full volume and let every drumbeat, every bassline, shiver through my whole body. I experienced a fevered kinship with anyone who seemed like they might get it. So when I got the email, and put on Unknown Pleasures for the first time in years, the first staccato, fizzing beats of Disorder took me back in a way I hadn’t anticipated. What sort of story would I write? What would it mean to create something new from something already loaded with meaning for me?Music and literature have long been symbiotic. The presence of the latter in the former peaked in the 1970s and 80s last year, Paul Genders mourned in the TLS for a time when the “habit of advertising in song the contents of one’s bookshelves suggested, too, that being widely read might even have a distinct glamour about it”. Joy Division never shied away from referencing everything from Nikolai Gogol to William Burroughs and beyond. Literary allusions are everywhere in Unknown Pleasures – even the title references Proust. The works of literature Curtis was passionate about show themselves through every song, and become new and remade.When I was younger, it didn’t occur to me to find Unknown Pleasures pretentious. It just made me feel seen. This was the sort of literature, music and connection I craved in my teens. I wanted there to be deeper meaning in everything. Ian Curtis read Sartre, Ballard, Kafka, Dostoevsky, and so did I. I don’t read this stuff any more. As we age, we grow embarrassed at our own seriousness, from remembering being that teenager sat in their bedroom, underlining words in a book. But as adults we can also forget the deep communion that music and literature can inspire, the sense of rightness clicking into place. Messages in a bottle, signals proclaiming who you are even as you first start to place yourself. It wasn’t surprising that Joy Division appealed to me: bookish, nihilistic, caught somewhere between timidity and self-destruction. There was intensity in every lyric, and even then I knew I wanted to be a writer, somehow, some sort.I chose music first: piano from the age of three, guitar from 13. Writing came later, but as a way to help instil meaning in the music. This means the two mediums have always been intertwined for me. When I write, I create a playlist that I will listen to obsessively for weeks. I see the scenes before I write them sisters in a swimming pool, a bus on a bleak mountain road. When I listened to New Dawn Fades, I saw a glowing computer screen in an empty room. A dark house made up of rooms in houses I had known.During the writing of my story, I returned to Wales to where I grew up. It’s a beautiful place, but one that could feel hopeless as a teenager. I love it, with a reluctant, fraught and passionate love – and yet how do you let go of the feelings that shaped you, the memories that music calls up, learning to accept the bad as part of the good?On a 90-minute bus ride to visit a friend, New Dawn Fades played on repeat in my ears as it had countless times before. There was snow on the mountain. Sheep blundered into the road. A change of speed, a change of style. There was a period of my late teens and 20s where going home meant failure. It meant my life had once more come crashing around me. It was me, waiting for me  Hoping for something more  Me, seeing me this time  Hoping for something else. It no longer means this.Writing from music is at once deeply personal and impersonal. It adds another degree of separation, because you’re using it as a jumping off point. Yet, no two people will listen to the same song in the same way, or interpret it identically. When it came to sit down and write the story, I was surprised by how personal it became. Others in the collection are more experimental, more abstract. It is pleasing now to read the stories and picture us all listening, refiguring, creating. Whatever we all did, the pathways mapped out in our stories mirror the territories mapped out in Unknown Pleasures: darkness and light, isolation and anxiety, the lovely mess of life. The legacy of the music, and what it meant to us, is laid out there on the page.Music gave me an opening into lives I didn’t know about, things I didn’t imagine. But more than anything, it taught me it was possible to write your way out of something. Stepping stones, starting with dirge-like songs on my guitar, led to poems, short stories and, finally, a novel. Writing pulled me through, will always pull me through, no matter where I go. Trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out, Ian Curtis sings on Interzone. Through writing and music, we make sense. We process. We find our ways, hopefully, to get out.• We Were Strangers: Short Stories Inspired by Unknown Pleasures (£12.99) is published by Confingo Publishing.

British buyers registered nearly 2m cars and vans from the continent in 2017, according to SMMT data.Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “Tariffs alone should be enough to focus minds on sealing a withdrawal agreement between the EU and UK but the potential impact of ‘no-deal’ means the stakes for the automotive sector are far higher. Without a deal, there can be no transition period and the complex issues surrounding tariffs and trade, customs, regulation and access to talent, will remain unresolved.“Our industry is deeply integrated across both sides of the Channel so we look to negotiators to recognise the needs of the whole European automotive industry and act swiftly to avoid disruption and damage to one of our most valuable shared economic assets.”The trade body said it was calling on Brexit negotiators on both sides of the Channel to prioritise a managed withdrawal for the UK that maintained a “status quo” transition for car makers.The SMMT has been a frequent and vocal critic of a no-deal Brexit, warning that the industry, which directly employs 186,000 people in the UK, is not ready for such an exit.Its latest intervention comes hard on the heels of a string of warnings by car makers operating in the UK, including BMW, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover.Honda said a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds a year, while BMW revealed plans to shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the official exit date on 29 March in 2019.Earlier in the week Jaguar Land Rover announced that about 2,000 staff would move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands. It revealed the decision only hours after its chief executive, Ralf Speth, was accused of “scaremongering” about the impact of leaving the EU by the Brexit-supporting Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4da7a91b1861e97fa8d732e70cb82f8f75dbd0/0_4322_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12df5569735511dd2a128a4f80749db5","title":"orla kiely queen of prints designer goes into administration","story":"High street woes continue as Irish designer’s fashion label closes website and storesOrla Kiely, the brand known for its 1970s-inspired prints and favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge and Alexa Chung, has closed its stores and website in the UK and Ireland after its parent company, Kiely Rowan, appointed administrators to wind down the company.The company, named after the Irish designer who owns it – known as the “queen of prints” – and her husband, Dermott Rowan, said it was entering voluntary liquidation “following various challenges that have faced the company over the past few years, both in the UK and abroad”.Insolvency practitioners David Rubin \u0026amp Partners have been appointed to handle the winding down of the handbag and fashion business, which includes stores on King’s Road and Seven Dials in London and one in Kildare, Ireland.A spokesman said the insolvency process, under which all assets of the business are sold to pay off creditors, had just commenced and the company would not be placed into liquidation until the beginning of October.It is understood that about 40 of the group’s 50-plus staff, half of whom work in the stores and the rest at the brand’s head office in Fitzrovia in London, have been made redundant.A spokesman added: “Orla Kiely’s home and design licensing business will not be affected, and its selection of accessories and homewares will continue to be sold through its distribution partners.”Julie Palmer, a partner at the advisory firm Begbies Traynor, said: “Orla Kiely had the backing of high-profile celebrities and clearly had appeal to the latest generation of shoppers. If this latest news shows anything, it’s that there is no magic formula to success. Celebrity endorsements and being on trend don’t always guarantee results.“Businesses must remain vigilant, adapt and innovate with a core strength if they are to rise out this distressing time for retail.”The problems at Orla Kiely come amid widespread difficulties on the high street that have pushed well-known retailers including House of Fraser and Toys R Us into administration. A whole string of retailers, including New Look and Mothercare, have embarked on mass store closures as they cope with the switch to online shopping and a slowdown in consumer spending.Kiely, who set up her own label 23 years ago after cutting her teeth as a wallpaper and fabric designer, was this year celebrated in A Life in Pattern, an exhibition at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London. Her breakthrough came in the mid-1990s with her signature laminated bags that featured a simplified plant print in bright and bold colours.In recent years the brand has become ubiquitous as its simple colourful graphics have played into the trend for mid-century furnishings. The label’s designs, once the preserve of well-heeled arty types, have appeared on bicycles, bedding, Tesco bags for life, budget fashion at the Uniqlo chain and on yoghurts.The homeware business, which accounts for about half the brand’s sales, will not be affected by the liquidation of Kiely Rowan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc3a26c640920f739221ba15c98c783aed7f2861/375_0_3181_1909/master/3181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7a3325f93374c15184be1a71696903f","title":"royal mail chair resigns amid boardroom turmoil","story":"Peter Long quits to focus on role at Countrywide as postal group aims to placate investorsThe chair of Royal Mail, Peter Long, has stepped down after one of the biggest executive pay revolts by investors in UK corporate history. The privatised postal service operator said Long had reviewed his board roles and decided to focus on his role as executive chair of the estate agent Countrywide.Royal Mail said Long had concluded it was no longer possible for him to remain executive chair of Countrywide and non-executive chair of Royal Mail.Long, who has served as non-executive chair of Royal Mail for the last three years, has been replaced by Les Owen, a board member, with immediate effect. Owen is a former chief executive of the insurer Axa Sun Life.Royal Mail will hope the boardroom reshuffle will placate angry investors. In July nearly three-quarters of the investors refused to support the pay package handed to the company’s new chief executive, Rico Back.Back was awarded an annual deal worth up to £2.7m if he reaches bonus targets, on top of a £6m “golden hello” for leaving the company’s European subsidiary.Trade union bosses warned that postal workers would be furious at seeing such lavish awards just months after they agreed to cuts to their pensions to help the company save money.Long, who is also deputy chair of the travel group Tui, has faced accusations of “over-boarding”. He stepped up to become executive chair of Countrywide in January after the UK’s largest estate agent issued its second profit warning in three months and ousted its chief executive Alison Platt.Countrywide, which operates under 50 or so brand names, including Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves, also faced a pay rebellion in August. It responded by scrapping a pay plan that could have handed its top executives, including Long, more than £20m.Owen’s appointment may raise some eyebrows, as he has been on the Royal Mail board since 2010. The UK corporate governance code states that where a director has served on a company board for more than nine years a clear explanation must be provided. Owen will receive an annual fee of £300,000, the same as his predecessor. Long will not get a payoff from Royal Mail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af479ec14fd4a04db8c5667d1c1598a018e72d57/0_166_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5347534e95a025884d8aededf888e01b","title":"world bank reports slower progress on extreme poverty","story":"Syrian war and population growth in parts of Africa hit drive to improve poverty rates The war in Syria and a population surge in sub-Saharan Africa have undermined efforts to reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty, the World Bank has said. But the decline was half the rate of previous years and had slowed further, according to preliminary figures that estimated a 1.4 percentage-point fall between 2015 and 2018.The agency, which aims to support sustainable development, added to the gloomy picture this year, with figures showing that those lifted out of extreme poverty struggled to make further progress up the income ladder.“Over the last 25 years, more than a billion people have lifted themselves out of extreme poverty, and the global poverty rate is now lower than it has ever been in recorded history. This is one of the greatest human achievements of our time,” he said.“But if we are going to end poverty by 2030, we need much more investment, particularly in building human capital, to help promote the inclusive growth it will take to reach the remaining poor. For their sake, we cannot fail.”Much of the reduction in global poverty over recent decades has been in China and neighbouring countries that have benefited from its spectacular growth rate. The global average has also benefited from the efforts of South American countries such as Brazil and Chile to lift people out of poverty.Poverty rates have improved in some east African countries, but much of sub-Saharan Africa has fallen back after a population rise, especially in Nigeria and other west African states.The first chapter of the report, Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2018: Piecing Together the Poverty Puzzle, which has been released in the run-up to the World Bank’s annual meeting next month in Bali, found that in the Middle East and north Africa, conflict in Syria and Yemen raised the level of extreme poverty from 9.5 million in 2013 to 18.6 million in 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number grew from 405 million people in 2013 to 413 million in 2015.Kim said alongside population growth, higher-than-expected poverty rates also reflected falling commodity prices, growing trade tensions, internal conflicts and political instability.Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to be the driving force behind the global population reaching 9.7 billion by 2050, from the current level of about 7.5 billion. By 2050, the UN expects about two-thirds of the global population to live in cities and more than half them to suffer shortages of basic commodities such as water.The World Bank has come under fire in the past from unions and anti-poverty agencies for backing mainstream economic policies that recommend weakening workers’ rights and cutting business taxes to drive economic growth.World Bank officials have countered that they are working with most countries in the sub-Saharan region with tailor-made policies to promote growth and alleviate poverty without having a one-size-fits-all agenda."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c15a49aa120cc90401265509d527e01fa33cd7a/23_102_1231_739/master/1231.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=371a180507b17db3badffdd966fe02e4","title":"everday memories of addis ababa a photo essay","story":"Beginning as a Tumblr page, website VintageAddis invites Ethiopians to share old photographs from family archives, and aims to document the lives of communities throughout the 20th century. The web project and Instagram feed started by Philipp Schütz, Wongel Abebe and Nafkot Gebeyehu, reveals an intimate view of the city.Terefe Berlie Asmare moved to Addis Ababa in 1980 and spent much of the next decade driving. He worked at a garage in the Ethiopian capital by day, and studied engineering by night. At weekends he would roam the countryside in his father’s car, with a tent bought from the German embassy in the boot, and a Konica in his pocket.“I always took the camera with me,” he says, standing in the garden of Addis Ababa’s iconic, though fading, Wabi Shebele hotel, which is still owned by the family of Haile Selassie, Ethiopia’s last emperor. Asmare, now in his 60s, documented his road trips extensively, being one of the few people he knew with a camera – he was the lucky owner of the world’s first commercial autofocus. “There were no photographers at that time,” he recalls. “So I did most of the pictures myself, often with a self timer.”In one carefree shot he leans cockily against his Mazda car in view of Lake Langano, a spot popular with Addis Ababa’s middle classes then and now. His white socks are pulled up high and a red baseball hangs nonchalantly from his fingers. It’s a world away from the land of famine and war that foreign photojournalists etched in the popular consciousness of the 1980s.Terefe’s photos – he believes has more than 1,000 from this period – might have disappeared were it not for Vintage Addis Ababa. A website that started in July 2017 as a Tumblr page, the project Vintage Addis Ababa invites Ethiopians to share old photos from family archives as a part of an effort to document the lives of various people throughout the country’s tumultuous 20th century of empire, war and revolution. Vintage Addis Ababa is the brainchild of Philipp Schütz, a Swiss publisher and photographer based in the city, of Wongel Abebe, an Ethiopian photographer, and of Nafkot Gebeyehu, a documentary photographer. The project peels away the popular cliches to reveal a more innocent city with an intimate and familiar past.Schütz says, referring to some of the 1,800 plus photographs they have amassed so far: “They look exactly like my parents’ family archive, of the photos of my grandparents in the 1950s.” He and Abebe were surprised by the enthusiasm with which the city’s residents accepted the idea. “It was totally unexpected,” he says. “We’re not digging out 100-year-old photos. These are just everyday, family, stories from a time which a lot of people still remember.”Abebe thinks the project taps into a latent frustration with the way the Ethiopia has been represented over the years. “People are sick and tired of the famine and all that,” she says. “This is about how people want to be remembered.” Many of the photos they have received were submitted by friends and relatives wishing to commemorate their departed, or ageing, loved ones.Photographs belonging to the late Kassa Gebru, an engineer-turned-businessman who built Addis Ababa hotel in the 1950s, were given to Abebe by his daughter, who felt he deserved recognition for founding the city’s first venue for live jazz.The project also appeals to the occasional nostalgia some Ethiopians feel for their past, even for a period like the 1980s, a decade stained by bloodshed and economic privation under the communist regime known as the Derg. “I was a bachelor,” says Asmare. “I spent most of my time travelling and I really enjoyed it. In Addis there was less traffic because nobody had cars – the Derg had banned imports – and on Saturday nights there would be parties in Ras hotel, in Ghion hotel, and of course here in Wabi Shebele. When I look at the photos in my albums it’s like a dream.”“Genet’s father was very strict, like most fathers at the time. She wasn’t allowed to go out of the house besides go to school she was expected to come straight home afterwards and would be in trouble if she didn’t arrive within 30 minutes after home-time.” Girls at the time were expected to be timid and walk with their heads tucked down. They weren’t allowed to leave their house for just recreation. “One time, a few girlfriends and I took a photo as we celebrated a friend’s graduation at Addis Ababa university, as she earned her business degree. I had to hide that picture for years so my father wouldn’t see it.”Vintage Addis Ababa is part of a broader trend towards revisiting and rethinking Africa’s recent history. Schütz was inspired by a project that digitises old Ugandan photographs, though his focus was narrower and with more emphasis on family and private lives. Calling to mind the work of the late Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, and Burkina Faso’s Sory Sanlé, both of whom captured the colourful optimism of post-independence west Africa, these photos of mid-century Addis Ababa evoke a similar mood. They chart the evolution of fashion, hairstyles, and even the city’s physical environment, making Vintage Addis Ababa a rich exercise in cultural history. Some of the districts seen here have long since disappeared, or, like the old Italian quarter known as Piassa, are now on the brink of demolition.The project started out as a website aiming to reach as many Ethiopians as possible, but it is soon to be published as a book. The team also hope the idea will eventually spread to other Ethiopian cities. As it stands, Vintage Addis Ababa offers a glimpse into the past but only a fleeting one. “We don’t want to be misleading,” says Abebe, of the project’s title. “You can never represent the whole of Ethiopia in pictures.”“We learned everything, starting from shooting and marching, to office administration and finance,” she remembers. After an intensive training that took well over a year, the women were graduated by the emperor himself. The newly inaugurated women army never went to a battlefield. “We were always invited to shows and asked to make appearances at official events,” Tsehay chuckles, “We were treated more like celebrities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b0d4f3e6268479691d4d675dea4ccd9cb7b91c5/0_124_4320_2593/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=243acf2d349cb39c0d5cd2a3d82af5e1","title":"hoarding business brexit britain stockpiling car","story":"Stockpiling of materials, from car parts to chocolate ingredients, could cause a recession A lettuce is a useless candidate for stockpiling ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit. A tin of soup is better. What else could be on the list of things to hoard is a question every household and business manager will ask themselves in the next few months.The government has shown the way with plans to order enough medicines to see the NHS through the worst that Brexit has to offer.Mondelēz, the owner of Cadbury, says it is hoarding cocoa beans and other ingredients of chocolate now that a messy, acrimonious orce with the European Union next March is more than an outside possibility.This week, BMW said it was bringing forward the 2019 summer shutdown of its Cowley Mini plant to next March as a defensive move. Manufacturers across the land are storing up parts just in case gridlock in parliament leads to similar gridlock in Britain’s ports, and basic goods cannot make their way through customs.BMW will do so, along with every other car manufacturer in the country, to make sure their minute-by-minute demand for specialist parts is secure. For them, Brexit is worse than a administrative headache – though that is bad enough: Brexit eats into their entire business game plan.As the car makers’ trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says in a report on Wednesday, Britain crashing out of the single market and customs union would add £5bn in annual tariffs to the price of the 2.7m cars and vans that cross the Channel each year. This bill stems from the huge number of parts that go from one factory to another, to and fro, before the finished article appears on a garage forecourt.The chemicals industry, the plastics sector and any firm using metals will be similarly affected. It is a long time since the UK smelted its own aluminium. Likewise, much of the high-grade steel used in Britain is imported from abroad.Some commentators doubt the EU would ever allow a complete breakdown in trade, or even sanction a scheme that hindered it in any way. Yet it makes sense to hoard raw materials just in case ports have a 19th-century look to them – with crowds of ships filling the harbour, queuing for a berth.A report by the economic consultancy the CEBR estimates that hoarding will be so widespread that it will boost economic growth over the next six months. The extent of this expansion will be sufficient to offset the lack of investment and trade that most forecasters have assumed will virtually kill off GDP growth between now and next March.The theory behind the CEBR report is that companies have a reason to stockpile – and virtually no cost of doing it while interest rates remain near zero. There is little history to go on because it’s unusual to have an economic event looming that can be quantified in its effects from mild to disastrous. Usually economic events come as a surprise and companies, faced with a collapse in consumer demand and nervous banks that refuse credit, react by running down their stockpiles.There is a cost to bringing forward billions of pounds worth of purchases, and that will be a reduction in GDP by the equivalent amount during the rest of 2019.“This makes a post-Brexit mini recession almost inevitable,” he says.Is this yet another anti-Brexit salvo from the team that brought you project fear? Not really. McWilliams is an independent economist and is merely adding and then subtracting the same amount of economic activity. Rather than a long, slow grind through the next 18 months, he is predicting more of a roller-coaster.And it depends on how spooked businesses become by the threat of a no-deal Brexit. The car companies say it is already too late to avoid making plans to protect themselves from the worst. Others might source more parts and materials from domestic suppliers – but an economy that generates almost a third of its GDP from trade cannot make that switch overnight.• Phillip Inman is economics editor of the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d70f67d20380c3b51453ac97a441f1ab5ad9c190/0_133_5436_3263/master/5436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4390c11e8a803981ed2797808b5c049","title":"londoners city london capital arrogant insular","story":"My dear Londoners, please do not fret. The rest of Britain doesn’t really think you’re arrogant and insular. Well, perhaps a little, but we’ll come back to that. We know that you are a city of rich depths and complexity, you are the city of EastEnders and the Notting Hill carnival, Millwall fans and Chelsea Pensioners. We know that London is Brixton, Southall and Golders Green – more than Fleet Street and Whitehall. In TV, cinema, music and comedy, we swim in your currents and bask in your culture. At the same time, if you put a very short list of adjectives to describe Londoners in front of us and ask us to pick three, well yes, we might tick the boxes marked “arrogant” and “insular”. This is less because we adhere to tired regional stereotypes, more because we adhere to the First Law of Silly Questions.Despite the mischievous headlines, non-Londoners’ choice of adjectives is probably the least interesting or revealing finding from the Centre for London’s research, published this week. Read more deeply and the emotional relationship between broader Britain and our capital city twists slowly into focus. London is seen as erse, expensive, crowded and chaotic. Most strikingly, nearly four out of five respondents thought that living and working in London “is not a realistic option for people like me”.It’s worth trying to unpick this finding. By any objective standard it cannot be true. Every year the population of London swells with budding Dick Whittingtons from around the country and the globe – many arriving almost entirely penniless. A few will indeed discover streets paved with gold a fair few more will find a city where the bedsheets are made of cardboard. Most will somehow muddle through in a world of long hours, low wages and high rents until finally settling into their own niche in the city’s unique social economy. An overpriced shoebox in Camden might not be everyone’s choice of lifestyle, but could hardly be considered an impossible dream.So when people tell pollsters that London is remote, alien, detached from our lives, I suspect we are talking less about London for what it actually is and more about London for what it represents – our administrative, political and economic capital. Most respondents told the survey that London may be good for the national economy, but that those benefits are not felt where they live. When asked which grand institutions could be moved elsewhere to make the country fairer, the most popular answer given was not the civil service, parliament, media or royalty. The most popular answer given was: “None.”Some might read this as petulance or a kind of depressive fatalism. I would argue it is simple realism. Around a decade ago the BBC decided to move many of its operations from London to Greater Manchester, and while this has brought some benefits to the economy around Salford Quays, possibly boosted house prices in leafy Didsbury and certainly improved the BBC in many respects as a broadcaster, does anyone seriously think it has made the country a fairer place?The truth is for the vast majority of people in Salford, the north-west or the country at large, the BBC continues to be viewed as a remote, inaccessible bureaucracy, managed and staffed by people unlike them. However true or fair this may be, it remains the perception, because the real gulf between people and power is not based upon geography, but on class and privilege, on social and racial hierarchies. We can move the mansion, brick by brick, to a different hill, but it remains the mansion on the hill.If this characterisation sounds familiar – remote, arrogant powerbrokers, a city that provides heralded economic benefits that are somehow never felt on our doorsteps – it could be because people have long said similar things about Brussels, with its arrogant commissioners and self-interested bureaucrats. In both cases, the charges are probably objectively untrue, yet emotionally understandable. A similar sense of alienation underpinned the American people’s rejection of Hillary Clinton and the political establishment in favour of You-know-who. Until we find ways to rebuild a sense of collective endeavour in our politics and repair the rifts in our fractured society, we will continue to endure a bitter mood of alienation and learned helplessness, and those frustrations will continue to erupt in unexpected fissures.So, Londoners, don’t take it personally. This really isn’t about you.

There is time for the course of Brexit to be altered. It may be that – this week in Salzburg, perhaps later – the EU will make a genuine attempt to save May’s bacon. It may be that some of the ideas from Chequers will eventually be built into the political declaration forming the basis of the future trade deal, which will be negotiated only after we leave on 29 March 2019. Nonetheless, it is worth exploring what went wrong at the start of May’s premiership to ask how a country that prided itself on having a strong, functioning civil service, a history of pragmatism and huge experience in international relations can have mishandled the approach to Brexit so badly.What is so remarkable is that the government’s first attempt to put the UK’s position on the table in respect of the future deal did not emerge until that Chequers meeting in July 2018. Given that it was always known that there would be only two years in this process once article\u0026nbsp50 was triggered, the question remains: what, beyond an obsession with internal faction-fighting among Tory MPs, was going on during the previous two years?New prime ministers know that the space to set a bold course is never so great as in the immediate aftermath of victory. The window of opportunity was wide open for May that summer. The paramount need was to find a way to unite the nation after the referendum – to create a country that works for every one of us, as she said. Sheltering behind the temporarily useful banality of “Brexit means Brexit”, the government could have moved swiftly to gather all the talents to consider the options. A royal commission would probably have been ruled out as too slow and cumbersome, but some less formal vehicle could have been engineered for the purpose.The time – indeed more time, but for the unnecessary rush to trigger article 50 – could have been used to scout the territory ahead, all the while talking to the EU, making plans to avoid the obvious traps and to seek a path to a successful outcome. Instead, the prime minster allowed her small team of close advisers to dictate the way ahead. The result was heard at the Tory conference that October, in a speech that included red lines on migration (“ending free movement”), sovereignty (“taking back control of our laws”) and ending the jurisdiction of the court of justice. Those red lines, repeated in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017, have hamstrung the UK ever since, while failing to quell the storms within the Conservative ranks.Those speeches made clear to the EU, if not the UK as a whole, that our path was heading straight towards Canada. And “Canada dry” at that: a narrowly focused free trade agreement concentrating on movement of goods. Even where such an arrangement is not in the UK’s interest, as with the loss of access to the Schengen Information System – an intelligence database used 539m times last year by British authorities to look up suspects and vehicles – and the European arrest warrant, so recently used by the UK to put out an alert on the men wanted in connection with the Salisbury attacks.Is there anything to be salvaged as the deadline of 29 March 2019 approaches? First, May must come out of the bunker and talk to real people – business people, employers and their workers – in real places, not simply those staged for the benefit of TV. She must invite in advisers from outside who know how borders actually work, or what applying a visa regime means in practice. Look at the multitude of blogs with policy offerings. At least show some signs of listening to, and engaging with, the other side, rather than driving through a hard Brexit that can only ever suit barely half the country.Second, she should use the window between now and the end of March 2019 to set up that royal commission to work out what the UK wants from that future UKEU free trade deal. The Brexit select committee already provides one template – but its membership should be expanded to include more devolved representation and civil society.And most of all, it’s time to front up with the public over the real trade-offs now in play. The closer we get to Canada, the more sovereignty is returned, but the greater the economic hit. Spell out clearly that what’s sauce for the British goose is sauce, too, for the EU gander. Applying a visa regime to EU nationals means a visa regime will be also applied to British nationals. Failure, even at this late stage, to engage with all sides will create a generation of the disengaged and discontented. That would hardly be the unifying legacy that the prime minister promised two summers ago.• Catherine Barnard is a professor of EU Law at the University of Cambridge and a senior fellow for The UK in a Changing Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a4f83cd51f62869945ce783cda4c9b5a2e0333b/8_16_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4d6c40714e132cc8ca954e334d22650","title":"rspca seal charity fish farms seals","story":"The animal charity’s certification of fish farms knowing that they shoot ‘pests’ indicates a tragic descent into hypocrisyAs the drive for growth and profit intrudes into all relationships, it captures even the bodies that exist to hold capital to account. Agencies of the state, newspapers and broadcasters, campaign groups and charities that claim to restrain corporate power fall under its spell. As their mission becomes confused and their purpose dissipates, substance is replaced with spectacle.Last week, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) issued a press release about the “incredible story” of Marina, a seal it rescued, that had become trapped under a rock on a beach in south Wales. “Moving a three-tonne boulder presents numerous challenges, but we were able to work with partners to free this seal, before giving her the six months of rehabilitation she so urgently needed.” Marina’s rescue is “testimony to the RSPCA’s tireless commitment to wild animals, and their welfare”.On the same day, the RSPCA’s head of campaigns, pushed into a corner during an online argument, wrote this: “Seal shooting is not culling it’s about humane pest control.” He was defending the slaughter of seals by Scottish salmon farms.The RSPCA won’t publish a list of the farms it has approved, citing a “contractual clause in the membership agreement”. But of the 24 people who sit on the advisory group for its assurance scheme (according to the most recent published list), 20 work for salmon farming companies. These companies include the four named in an investigation into seal shooting in 2013, by the Global Alliance Against Industrial Aquaculture,\u0026nbspas\u0026nbsp“the\u0026nbspworst\u0026nbspoffenders”.There is no closed season for shooting seals. When lactating mothers are shot, their orphaned pups starve to death on remote beaches. The RSPCA does not deny that farms it certifies shoot seals. It tells me it is urgently trying to bring the practice to an end. I might have found this more convincing if it hadn’t said the same thing in 2008. It also maintains that shooting seals is “a last resort”. But the majority of Scottish salmon farms fail to double-net their cages to exclude seals. This is more expensive than bullets, but you might have hoped it would be the minimum requirement for an RSPCA Assured farm.The RSPCA tells me that “double netting is not suitable for all sites”, but is unable to tell me what proportion of the farms it certifies could use double netting. Where this method cannot be used, you might have hoped the society would say “that’s it: we will not certify salmon farming here”.It insists that farms that want its accreditation and that are at high risk of predation by seals must have “acoustic deterrent devices in place where appropriate”. These make a loud noise intended to scare seals away. Unfortunately, they also cause pain and distress to dolphins, porpoises and whales, disrupting their behaviour and driving them out of their feeding grounds. These are by no means the only problems caused by salmon farms.In the hope of controlling this infestation, some salmon farms dose their fish with organophosphate pesticides. These are likely to devastate crustacean populations in the sea lochs, and many other species that depend on them. Some of the companies providing the fish meal on which farmed salmon are fed trawl and grind up entire marine ecosystems, arguably causing greater environmental damage than any other fishing operation.The harder you look at this industry, the more obvious it becomes that it is inherently incompatible with either animal welfare or environmental protection. Yet the Scottish government, which sees salmon farming as a crucial growth industry, wants it to double by 2030. It seems to me that the RSPCA’s assurance provides the necessary fig leaf.The RSPCA insists that it is not motivated by the fees it receives for certifying salmon farms. These, it says, “are ploughed back into the scheme’s running costs”. I’m sure this is true. The problem, I feel, runs much deeper: to my eyes, its mission seems to have slipped from preventing cruelty to modifying industrial animal farming. If its objective is to prevent cruelty, surely it should instead endorse the rapid shift towards veganism?Marina is the spectacle – the actor in the spotlight – that helps to drive the RSPCA’s public image. The unapproved seals of Scotland and their orphaned pups, in the darkness behind the stage, are reduced to the status of pests. Debord defined the spectacle as “a negation of life that has invented a visual form for itself”. He was right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b04195cf94b285bee48f2de3926b124da15f20/0_481_7114_4267/master/7114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2475c79fad8ab4430442292b2f6539c","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game. By Chas Newkey-Burden“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

Proof, if proof were needed, of the broad appeal of tie-dye, which is having a moment of mainstream acceptability.Tie-dye has been on our radar for the last few seasons, largely because it has appeared as much on the catwalk as off it – one of the street-style highlights from this weekend’s London shows was an Ashley Williams green-and-yellow tie-dye hoodie that read: “Don’t know don’t care.”Its current popularity may be thanks to its versatility. Tony Glenville, creative director of the school of media and communication at London College of Fashion, describes it as “a great background to put logos over” that works “at a designer level and cheap”. Tie-dye pieces on the high street (see Asos T-shirts, Champion hoodies and Stussy shirts) are also tapping into the DIY aesthetic in an age in which authenticity is prized, regardless of whether it actually is authentic.Tie-dye was once authentic, says Alistair O’Neill, professor of fashion history and theory at Central Saint Martins. According to O’Neill, various guises of “resist-dying”, where materials and methods are used to prevent the dye from reaching all the cloth, have existed for centuries in countries such as Indonesia, Japan and India. Tie-dye as we know it was adopted in the US by hippies who were – according to O’Neill - interested in “using secondhand folk and tribal fabrics and bringing those into the mix to suggest an alternative anti-consumer form of dress”, and realised they could make their own DIY version. It was also a lot about psychedelic drugs and “the idea of acid visions and forms of visual transportation that mind-altering drugs can offer”.In the late 60s, tie-dye fell to commercialisation on the US east coast after an employee of the failing Rit Dye company persuaded his bosses to swap powder dyes for squeezable liquid versions – all the better for creating tie-dye with. The garments went on to be sold at Woodstock, a seminal moment marked by Janis Joplin on the stage in head-to-toe tie-dye.In 2018, though, it’s more about muted colours. At Ganni, tie-dye T-shirts the colour of butterscotch Angel Delight have a sophistication their psychedelic cousins could only dream of, while at Topshop, a Glamorous Bardot top gets the tie-dye tratment in muted sky-blue. As O’Neill says, “it doesn’t look particularly 1968” – though it might be a little easier to wear than that decade’s rainbow brights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed57b698173ac449b62fb62c06824b6d5d97bd29/0_152_3446_2067/master/3446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f98154edc1f9b8d115ab0f8bda6d0023","title":"mile 22 review mark wahlberg peter berg","story":"In his latest collaboration with director Peter Berg, Wahlberg leads a special ops team on a mission to recover stolen batches of nuclear materialRecently Mark Wahlberg startled us all by releasing details of his daily fitness routine. It involves getting up at 2:30am, a half-hour of golf, but three times that long in the shower. What on earth can Mark Wahlberg be doing for 90 minutes in the shower? The answer could well be ... very much what he’s doing over 94 minutes in this film, and it doesn’t involve pleasuring anyone else.He stars in a chaotically undisciplined and aggressive action movie, coked up on its own machismo, with loads of stuff about what the special forces guys need to do to keep all the whiny ungrateful civilians safe.

Bocuse is right, however, that, despite its obviously polygonal shape, France is the home of perfect, and often perfectly round, tarts: even the meanest bakery seems to turn out flawless pastry cases full of crème pat and seasonal fruit.Unlike the tarte tatin, which must be served hot from the oven, the classic patissier’s tart can be made well in advance: ideal for impressing guests, or just allowing you to drink a little too much over Sunday lunch and still produce dessert afterwards. And, like all the best showstopper dishes, it’s surprisingly easy to execute. Not that you need to tell anyone that.I’m wary of getting too prescriptive here because, as Bruno Loubet notes in his book Mange Tout, we grow a huge and fabulous array of apples in the UK, very few of which ever make it into the big shops, so I echo his plea “to try different British varieties … and support the great British apple”.That said, there’s a reason almost all the recipes I try call for “crisp eating” apples, as Julia Child puts it – cox’s orange pippins are the most frequently mentioned, though in France the closely related reinette is the standard choice, and if you find any, snap them up: the golden reinette was apparently very popular here in the 18th and 19th centuries, but is, in my experience, rarely seen today.There are a few caveats, though: cooking apples won’t work, because you need the fruit to hold its shape when heated, and anything too mild (golden delicious, I’m looking at you) will be similarly underwhelming on a tart. Look for dryish, intensely flavoured varieties, like the aforementioned cox, or russet, early windsor or laxton’s fortune.Most recipes also call for the apples to be peeled, cored and very finely sliced – 2mm is the usual instruction – but, in fact, I rather like the look of the peel on the finished dish, so – although it would horrify any fussy French patissier – I wouldn’t bother with the first step. (I also think 2mm slices have a tendency to become leathery: 3-4mm give juicier results.)Jane Grigson’s Fruit Book gives an Alsatian recipe with a brioche dough base that sounds intriguing, but sadly lies outside my remit here. Loubet and Breton baker Richard Bertinet use puff pastry, Koffmann and the Master Chefs rich, sweet pâte sucrée, and Michel Roux calls for something he calls “flan pastry”, which contains slightly less butter than a classic shortcrust, and adds water for a crisper texture.The puff versions are the least popular: deemed to be too dry with this rather dry fruit, while the gloriously buttery, enriched sweet shortcrusts are delicious to eat, but quite difficult to work with. Roux’s sturdy, crunchy alternative gets my vote as cook, though I’ll be upping the sugar a little bit, because if you want health food, eat an apple.Although I’m generally a fan of blind baking (insert topical Bake Off joke here), I don’t think this tart needs it: the slightly softer bottom is a nice counterpoint to the biscuity sides.The most interesting variation between recipes occurs between these two layers. For Roux, it’s a sharp and very buttery apple puree, made with the same apples as he uses on top. Loubet, who credits his recipe to his mother, sandwiches it with a pleasingly boozy frangipane. Bertinet mixes frangipane with creme patissiere and bramley apple puree, Koffmann makes a rich egg custard and the Master Chefs do the same, but then flavour it with white pepper and beat in both a caramel and an apple puree, proving that they do indeed have a full brigade behind them.As the instructions are fairly vague, I’m not entirely sure I’ve got the results right, but, after twice as long in the oven as the recipe suggests, I end up with a wobbly, eggy mixture that reminds us slightly of bread-and-butter pudding. Not unpleasant, certainly, but not terribly appley, while Koffmann’s wonderfully sticky confection is apparently more like “those things you get at Halloween: toffee apples”. The Roux tart proves most popular – “this is the only one that really tastes of apples” – but it cannot be denied that almonds and apples were made to be together.I’m torn. I could make an apple frangipane, like Bertinet’s, but this robs the fruit puree of the sharpness, which is one of its principal charms. Instead, I decide to take inspiration from that distinctly un-Gallic creation, the bakewell pudding, and use a layer of unsweetened apple puree topped with a fluffy frangipane. Cultural appropriation, perhaps, but with only the very best of intentions.Loubet brushes his tart with rosemary-infused butter and sugar before it goes into the oven (“my generation’s contribution” to the family recipe), but again, I don’t think it needs any more in the way of either ingredient, delicious as the rosemary is. It is a nice touch, however, to glaze the fruit after baking for that perfect patisserie sheen. After all, this is a tart you’re going to want to show off.For the pastry250g plain flour2 tbsp caster sugar½ tsp fine salt125g butter, diced1 egg, beatenFor the frangipane60g soft butter60g icing sugar, sifted2 drops almond essence1 egg, beaten115g ground almonds1 tsp cornflour3 tbsp brandy or rumFor the filling1kg eating apples, preferably dryish ones such as cox’s25g butter1 vanilla pod (optional)3 tbsp smooth apricot jam or quince jelly, to glazePut the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor and whizz briefly with the butter, then add the egg and just enough cold water (one to two tablespoons) to bring it together into a dough. Alternatively, rub the butter in by hand, then stir in the egg and water. Form into a disc, wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.Meanwhile, core and peel 400g of the apples and cut into chunks. Put in a pan with the butter, 75ml water and the vanilla pod, if using, and cook over a low heat until very soft, adding more water if necessary. Puree with a stick blender or mash well, and leave to cool.Grease a 25cm, fairly deep tart tin. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about 5mm, and line the tin with it, pressing it in without stretching it and leaving some overhang. Prick in several places with a fork, and put in the fridge to chill.To make the frangipane, beat together the butter, icing sugar and almond essence until fluffy, then whisk in the egg. Fold in the remaining ingredients and a pinch of salt, and mix until well combined.If you’re feeling fussy, peel the remaining apples, but you really don’t have to, then core them, cut in half and slice to about 3-4mm thick.Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Spread the pastry base with the apple puree and top with the frangipane mixture. Finally, top with the apple slices in two concentric overlapping circles, with a few in the middle, then bake for about 30 minutes, until golden brown.Heat the jam over a low heat until runny, then carefully brush the apples until glossy.• When it comes to great apple tarts of the world, are you on Team France, or do you prefer a crostata di mele or apfelwähe?

Success without money is all but impossible in the modern game, but wealth brings no guarantees. Football still has the capacity to make the richest of men seem very foolish if they pursue glamour at the expense of substance – a heartening moral, so long as you don’t think too closely about the source of the wealth that is paying for Neymar to squander his immense talents in an entitled fug of self-indulgence.For Paris Saint-Germain, there has been no development. The lessons of last season have not been learned. All the flaws that undid PSG against Real Madrid in last season’s last 16 were there again at Anfield on Tuesday. Leaving three forwards high up the pitch to float about and occasionally pull off a trick may be enough in Ligue 1 – given PSG have begun the season with five straight wins and have scored at least three goals in every game, it demonstrably is – but it is no way to play against proper opposition. The Air Jordan branding may be intended to add an extra shot of glamour, but in context it appears to say little more than, “please nutmeg me while I appeal half-heartedly for offside.”There is an irony to this, of course, that PSG’s domination of the French league is precisely what prevents them being truly competitive in Europe. This is the great paradox of the financial structures of the modern game and it one of the factors that will probably lead, sooner rather than later, to some sort of pan-national super-league. When there is no challenge, it’s only natural complacency sets in. When there are no predators at home, why would you flee the red-faced men with sticks and guns? When there is no peril in your league, why would you bother to track Trent Alexander-Arnold?Is Thomas Tuchel happy with this? This, after all, is a man who grew up in the hard-pressing world of the Bundesliga. He was regarded as the new Jürgen Klopp, a manager forged at a similar school. He is somebody who dined with Pep Guardiola after his Dortmund side had lost 5-1 to Bayern, whose love of the theory of juego de posición outweighed the sting of defeat. There can be no version of that conception of the game that features three men standing 50 yards upfield from their midfield, barely raising a jog as a defender surges past them again. PSG football is not Tuchel football it may not even be football.Questions were asked as to why Gareth Southgate had opted to go and watch Mason Mount play for Derby against Blackburn in the Championship rather than seeing Alexander-Arnold take on Neymar, or Jordan Henderson look to impose himself against the grandees of France, but he probably made the right choice. This was no more a gauge of their talents than Einstein doing his times tables would have been of his.In the end, perhaps it was too easy. The second half became a stroll, despite Thomas Meunier halving Liverpool’s lead five minutes before half-time, hooking in a loose ball in the box. Almost 40 minutes of it had passed and PSG not only hadn’t had a shot, they had managed only eight passes in the 30 yards closest to Liverpool’s goal. The game had taken on a weird aspect, as Liverpool, charged for an epic, found it a stroll and found their own focus slipped as a consequence. A lax pass from Mohamed Salah, a quick turnover and Neymar had laid in Kylian Mbappé to equalise. Indulged they may be, but they are still good players. Give them a chance and they will still take it, just as the most decadent of the late Romans would still eat a grape so long as you peeled it first and popped it in their mouths.But most damning of all was what followed. PSG had been gifted a point. They had got away with one of the most disgracefully negligent performances a club of their resources has ever put on. They could go back to Paris and fuel their self-regard with a useful away point. All they had to do was compete for the final seven minutes plus injury time. But they could not.Liverpool, to their immense credit, were able to re-engage. And when placed under pressure again, PSG’s swagger became a whimper. Look at Roberto Firmino’s winner and count how many PSG players have turned away rather than attempt a block: these are basics of defending, of professional self-respect, and they cannot do them.Each season the question seems to become more fundamental: what are PSG? A vanity project for Neymar? A strangely misplaced Nike marketing ploy? A laundromat for Qatar’s international reputation? They’re certainly not a football club in any traditional sense. And if they are supposed to be an agent of Qatari soft power, they really need to start emphasising the power aspect of that phrase rather than the soft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bbb866eba0b97fcc00b17545b582d31cddc7e46/0_257_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73f74018013b9a571904b65bc22707b2","title":"the fiver psg liverpool tottenham inter","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Tottenham Hotspur don’t like playing Internazionale at San Siro very much. They’ve done it three times now, and it never goes well. Eight years ago they were three goals and a man down in 14 minutes, eventually losing a Big Cup group game 4-3, a young Philippe Coutinho running at them again and again with great purpose as ‘Arry Redknapp surveyed the damage with shocked impotence, the closest a football manager has ever come to recreating the cover of McCartney II. Then in 2013 André Villas-Boas and his side squeaked through a Big Vase round-of-16 tie, but only after shipping a three-goal first-leg lead, and a 4-1 defeat on the night is a 4-1 defeat, whichever way you spin it. And now the events of Tuesday. Oh lads! How could you!Tottenham’s late capitulation against Inter is their third defeat in a row, following a 2-1 loss at Watford and a 2-1 thrashing by Liverpool. It’s the first time such a sequence has been suffered during the Mauricio Pochettino era, and it caused the manager to lose the place completely in the post-match presser. When it was suggested it might have been an idea to play the rested Kieran Trippier and Toby Alderweireld, steam whistled out of his lugs with immense force. The word “disrespect” could just about be heard amid the skirl. It was left to Érik Lamela to look on the bright side. “We’re not losing our confidence, we believe in each other,” he insisted, the sort of claim you make when confidence and belief are very much at a premium, and you’re beginning to worry quite a lot about what Glenn Murray and Shane Duffy might do if you concede a corner at the weekend.Still, for all Tottenham’s current problems, at least they’re not avant garde art movement PSG, whose team and tactical approach appear to have been assembled using techniques described in the Dada Manifesto. By cutting up a load of words from an old match report, putting them in a bag, drawing them out, and placing them in the order in which they were picked, they’ve ended up with a front three of Kylian Mbappé, trainee referee Edinson Cavani, and the former footballer Neymar. Somehow, it’s not quite clicking, and Tuesday’s random abstractions at Anfield strongly suggest yet another failed Big Cup bid is on the cards.

Angela Merkel said you must be seen to suffer. All these things will come back and we’ll see more and more pressure. And she’ll have a deal which she won’t be able to bring back to the House of Commons because it will be lumbered with loads of other EU demands. So she’s going to have to have something else.”Davis predicted that May would have to change tack to avoid the prospects of exiting the EU with no deal. “The time when the decision has got to be taken are going to November, when it is really threatening. Everybody is afraid of no deal, then there will be a point at which it will be possible to reset … there will be other deals on the table at that point.”He added: “The reset is to step back to what Donald Tusk offered in March. He said you can have a free trade agreement.”Citing EU trade deals with Canada and South Korea, Davis said: “It is possible. Indeed it is almost possible off the shelf.”He urged May to use the £39bn orce settlement agreed last year as a bargaining chip to get a better deal than that proposed in the Chequers plan. He said: “We have a negotiating lever. We have 39bn of them, the £39bn contribution we are going to make in the withdrawal agreement. Once we have signed that away our negotiating leverage evaporates.”He warned that May would be offered only “warm words” at Wednesday’s EU leaders summit in Salzburg. “I wouldn’t expect much from Salzburg, in terms of outcomes,” he said.On Tuesday, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc was ready to improve its proposal on avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. The border issue was the “one area where I think the EU is softening”, Davis claimed.He pointed out that Barnier appeared ready to accept checks away from the border after ruling them out earlier this year. “Those are the very methods you use to cure the problem of the hard border in Northern Ireland itself,” Davis said.Davis also dismissed the growing clamour for a people’s vote on the final deal. He said: “To announce a second referendum would be to invite the European Union to give us the worst deal possible in order to persuade us to stay in.“That’s the consequence of a second referendum and is why it is very bad idea. It is completely against the national interest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/078558979c3076937f0dd1f85cfb784dbfd2ce43/0_213_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8f763a70b38c0b9969dcf845e951565","title":"labour conference path mps crucial brexit vote jeremy corbyn","story":"Dominant issue on conference agenda presents formidable challenge for Corbyn and partyJeremy Corbyn will kick off Labour’s annual conference at Pier Head in Liverpool on Saturday with one of the noisy rallies that have become a kind of political comfort zone over his three years as party leader: soundtrack from The Farm, an uplifting tirade against social injustice, cheering, optimistic crowds.But the dominant issue on the agenda is one that presents a formidable political challenge for Corbyn and the Labour party: Brexit.When Theresa May brings her Brexit deal back to parliament for MPs’ approval – perhaps within weeks – what happens next won’t just be critical for Britain’s future, but a moment of truth for Corbyn’s Labour party, and the wave of popular support that helped him sweep away the Tories’ majority last June.Brexit would have been a headache for Labour, whoever its leader. The party’s electoral fortunes have long depended on bridging the gap between “Hampstead and Hull”, as Andy Burnham called it during the referendum campaign.Voters’ 2016 decision to leave the European Union, and the brand of populist, identity-based politics the campaign unleashed, struck at the heart of that already-fragile coalition.Add to that the instinctive Euroscepticism of some in Corbyn’s inner circle, and the ardent Europeanism of many of the younger (and indeed older) members who swept into the party to support him, and every step has been a balancing act.At last year’s general election, the judgment of Labour’s strategists that Britain’s voters didn’t want politicians to spend the seven week campaign banging on about Brexit appeared to pay off. While Tim Farron’s Lib Dems talked of little else (apart from his attitude to gay sex), and May tried to win over voters by saying the Labour leader would be “alone and naked in the negotiating chamber of the European Union”, Corbyn talked about living standards, schools cuts and workers’ rights.Former Corbyn adviser Matt Zarb-Cousin said: “I actually think the political strategy for dealing with Brexit, as something that Labour didn’t want – it didn’t call the referendum – has been very, very good. They could very easily have fallen into a trap where we oppose it, oppose article 50: and then I dread to think what would have happened in the last election, if that had been the case – given that most constituencies were leave, and Brexit was still very much fresh in people’s minds.”But ambiguity became less tenable as the negotiations in Brussels advanced. So Labour’s position has necessarily evolved, through a series of fraught internal negotiations – and sometimes outright confrontation.When shadow cabinet members arrived at the Brexit subcommittee in January, they were each handed a numbered copy of a policy paper, which they were to give back at the end of the meeting.Since before Christmas, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, had been arguing for the party to announce that it would advocate joining a customs union with the EU after Brexit. He and his team believed it was essential to safeguarding manufacturing supply-chains, and avoiding a hard border in Ireland. He had presented a paper arguing the point to Loto (leader of the opposition), as Corbyn’s office is known.But close allies of the leader were sceptical. Some were anxious about appearing to be railroaded into a policy shift by noisy advocates of a customs union on Labour’s backbenches – Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie and others. Others were keen to ensure any stance the party ultimately took could reconcile leavers and remainers, and believed Starmer was ratcheting Labour’s policy, step by step, towards a position that would look to the average leave voter like a bid to overturn Brexit.So the inner core of Corbyn’s team – which includes Jon Trickett and Diane Abbott, as well as key advisers such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Fisher – had decided on an alternative approach. They would table their own paper, kicking the customs union issue into the long grass.To Starmer’s evident fury, Corbyn began reading aloud from a pad. As the meeting went on, it became clear several of those present had seen the paper in advance – but the shadow Brexit secretary, the man responsible for Labour’s policy, had not.Visibly angry, Starmer made clear that he fundamentally disagreed with the approach outlined in the paper. Others spoke in his support, including Labour’s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, and the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith – whose open disagreement with the leadership’s position would lead to his sacking a few weeks later.Several people present at the meeting told the  the general feeling in the room was that Starmer was willing to resign, rather than sign up to a paper with which he disagreed. “He looked close to telling them to shove it – and I think that did count for something,” said one person present. “I think Jeremy was slightly surprised at how angry Keir was.”Another said: “Jeremy started speaking, and Keir just said, ‘enough,’ this was just completely outrageous. He did lose his temper. I think they were genuinely shocked at his reaction. They tried to bounce him and it completely backfired.”When it became clear the cost of stalling on a customs union could be losing the shadow Brexit secretary – one of the few resignees in the “chicken coup” of summer 2016 who had been tempted back on to the frontbench, and a reassuring figure for many in the PLP – Corbyn blinked. The paper was collected at the end of the meeting and never seen again. “The text got dumped,” said one of those present.That dramatic moment marked the low point for relations between Starmer’s team and the leadership. Little more than a month later, Corbyn made a speech at a slick event at a car factory in Coventry, which shifted the party’s position to recommending a customs union.Drafts were painstakingly negotiated in advance with the Brexit subcommittee, and signed off by the shadow cabinet. The move was balanced with a series of criticisms of the EU single market, which Corbyn’s aides spun as central to the thrust of the speech.Trickett said the position they ultimately reached was the right compromise. “I can say to remainers: we intend to remain as close as we can to the single market, and inside a customs union,” he said. “Equally I can say to Brexiteers, that we are going to have an interventionist industrial and regional strategy, which means that for the first time in 30 years, the government can intervene to rebuild the economy that was devastated by the Thatcher settlement.”He added: “The country remains deeply ided. We have to seek a synthesis between the Brexiters and the remainers creating a principled vision of another kind of society which can allow both sides to go away with honour.”All sides attest that there has since been a more collaborative approach at Labour’s top table. But the clash revealed fierce tensions over how to funnel the constructive ambiguity of last year’s general election manifesto stance towards a coherent response to the ultimate question every one of its 257 MPs will have to face in the next few weeks: can they support May’s Brexit deal?Corbyn himself is often blamed as the driving force behind Labour’s willingness to endorse Brexit – whipping his MPs to support article 50, and rejecting key elements of the single market – but attendees at the Coventry speech drafting session recall the leader being less attached to the criticisms of the EU competition regime, for example, than his cerebral lieutenant, Milne.Corbyn is certainly instinctively Eurosceptic, but his friends insist he is no enthusiast for Brexit. “I think he finds it completely insufferable I think he just wants to get through it,” said one close ally. Zarb-Cousin, who worked in Loto in the build-up to the article 50 vote, said: “The idea that Seumas is a Brexiteer is nonsense Corbyn the same. Of course there’s a strain of Euroscepticism on the left – but who isn’t a bit Eurosceptic?”Meanwhile, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell – Corbyn’s longtime political soulmate and brother-in-arms – is repeatedly described by those close to the heart of Labour’s Brexit decision-making as pragmatic and tactical – certainly more so than his rabble-rousing reputation might suggest.The 2017 manifesto stated Labour’s principles in approaching the negotiations – it would put a “strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union,” and “put jobs and the economy first” – but left plenty of wriggle-room for candidates with different shades of opinion and space for Labour’s policy to develop as the negotiations went on.But it didn’t take long for the veneer of unity created by the campaign to crack. Just three weeks after the June general election, when MPs had barely unpacked their boxes and settled into their new offices, the group of anti-Brexit rebels derisively nicknamed the “shinies” by colleagues, laid down a marker for the battles ahead by tabling an amendment to the Queen’s speech, calling for the government to keep Britain in the single market and the customs union.Three MPs resigned from junior roles to back it, and they were joined by 46 others, in defiance of the exasperated Labour whips – an extraordinary rebellion so early in a brand new parliament.“From that moment, we knew the EEA was going to be a big issue for us,” said one senior adviser. The leadership were furious. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, went public to say Umunna and his colleagues were “virtue signalling”.The shinies – Umunna, Chris Leslie, Stephen Doughty, Stephen Kinnock and a shifting group of others – share few political views with the hardline Tory European Research Group (ERG) but their modus operandi is strikingly similar: the WhatsApp-driven whipping operation the frequent media appearances the fervent belief in their cause and the willingness to resort to any and every parliamentary tactic to exert pressure on their leadership.Time and again over the past 12 months and more, Labour unity has been severely tested over Brexit. Corbyn and his colleagues have consistently been accused of dithering, or vacillating, or lack of clarity.But senior party strategists insist they have taken a deliberate decision not to get tangled up in the fine detail of Brexit – and to let May play the lead role.“We want to talk about things that people care about – and ways in which Brexit impacts the things that people care about. Things that impact people’s pay, their public services, their living standards – not some rather technical stuff, like max-fac,” said one senior adviser.“The whole process has been miles away from the people. It’s been like the bubble, condensed. The challenge for all of us, and has been all the way through, is how do you burst through that into being able to talk about the principles around Brexit?”In May, the festering ision over the EEA issue flared up again in the Lords. Labour’s leader in the upper house, Angela Smith, had led a painstaking, cross-party process to gather support around a series of amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, which they believed had a good chance of winning a strong majority – and crucially, the support of MPs, when the legislation went back to the House of Commons.But the shinies, frustrated at the refusal of Corbyn and his frontbench colleagues to force the issue of a softer Brexit, took the unusual step of launching a lobbying operation in the “other place”, as MPs call the Lords, to persuade Labour peers they should back an amendment – rejected by Lady Smith – that would commit the government to trying to negotiate membership of the EEA.Smith – and Starmer, with whom she works closely – were absolutely furious. They were affronted by the MPs’ audacity in taking their war with the leadership to the Lords. That set up another brash confrontation in the Commons, when the legislation was sent back to MPs. Starmer has long argued against the EEA, believing it fails to solve the Irish border problem – because members are not part of a customs union – and would leave Britain a “rule-taker”.The debate painfully exposed isions, with Caroline Flint, MP for Don Valley, saying she believed the amendment was aimed at subverting the referendum result.Starmer sought to defuse the row by tabling Labour’s own amendment, taking another incremental step towards the single market by promising to seek “shared institutions”, and Labour whips urged MPs to abstain.But ultimately, the party split three ways, in an odd double-rebellion that underlined the capacity of the Brexit issue to create complex political isions.Both sides remain angry about what the leadership saw as a confected spat, aimed at embarrassing Corbyn and the remain MPs saw it as a failure by Starmer in particular to grasp an opportunity to soften Brexit.It is against this fraught background that the Labour frontbench – and each inidual MP – will have to decide whether to support May’s Brexit deal. Formally, Starmer has laid out six tests.Some, such as “does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU?” seem loosely worded enough to be fudgeable. But test two, “does it secure the exact same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and the customs union?” appears impossible to meet, at least on May’s current trajectory, boxed in as she is by her own self-imposed red lines, which are rigorously policed by the extremists in her party. So it has long appeared inevitable Labour will whip its MPs to vote down the deal.Privately, some Labour MPs believe the six tests were set up as a figleaf to allow the party to reject just about any deal as a “Tory Brexit”, in the hope of triggering a general election and catapulting Corbyn into Downing Street.Labour’s iconoclastic shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, hinted at that view in April at a private meeting, a recording of which was subsequently leaked to the website Red Roar. One party aide recalled that when the first reports emerged, suggesting Gardiner had referred to the six tests as “shibboleths”, the reassuring response from Loto was that the public wouldn’t know what a shibboleth was. That counsel proved less soothing when the full recording emerged, in which he was heard to call them “bollocks”. Starmer was livid, Gardiner was reined in, and some MPs have referred to him ever since as “Barry Bollocks”. But the general sense remains that it would take a significant change of position from the prime minister – one she is highly unlikely to take – for the frontbench to throw their weight behind a deal.That sets the scene for a seismic political moment, whenever the so-called meaningful vote is held. May’s narrow majority, even with the DUP’s backing, means if all of Labour’s MPs – and its three independents, John Woodcock, Frank Field and Jared O’Mara – vote against, it would take fewer than 10 Tory rebels to defeat the government. Every single MP will count.Yet in these topsy-turvy times, with the bonds of party loyalty loosened by the solvent of Brexit, it is no forgone conclusion that Labour MPs will fall into line. Labour whips, and Starmer’s team, have already begun the task of working on potential rebels.Downing Street, in the person of May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, has already made contact with Labour centrists on occasion in recent months – and the Tories will push hard the idea that by opposing the agreement, MPs are tacitly backing Jacob Rees-Mogg, Peter Bone and the other “Brextremists”.But a significant complicating factor is the growing momentum behind calls for the issue of Brexit to be settled with a second referendum – or a “People’s Vote”, as one deep-pocketed campaign group has it.Labour strategists remain deeply sceptical about the politics and the practicalities of a referendum. They believe the time before Brexit day is too short polling doesn’t support the idea unless it is sliced and diced so much as to be all but meaningless and they believe leave voters would be infuriated by the prospect of being asked to confront the question again. Gardiner has expressed that view publicly, suggesting it could even lead to “civil disobedience”.One senior Labour figure wearily described a second Brexit vote as a “red herring” another even suggested it would play into May’s hands, by strengthening her argument that if leavers did not back her deal, Brexit could be unpicked.“The only way that their deal is going to get voted down, is if some of the ERG vote against it – and they’re not voting against it if they believe one of the options then is a second referendum,” the Labour figure said. “The surefire way to get the ERG to vote with the government is to talk about a second referendum.”But outside team Corbyn, the pressure to back a second poll is mounting. Smith says: “I would personally prefer another general election, and a clean cut, ‘you can’t handle this, prime minister, you need another government to deal with it.’ But we may be coming to that point where people are clamouring for another vote.”Meanwhile, a handful of Labour MPs for whom frustrating Brexit is a goal that outranks all others – and whose loyalty to Corbyn was always wafer-thin – are watching and waiting. If the moment comes to take a stand against leaving – at a new referendum, for example – and the frontbench refuses to take it, they are ready to splinter away.If Brexit goes ahead, they are laying the groundwork for a breakaway party that would claim it could reunite a fractured country. How large a number of MPs follows this small band of diehards will depend in large part on how the party conducts itself in this crucial next six months, until Brexit D-day in March next year.One leftwing MP who has been supportive of Corbyn’s leadership said: “Brexit is a symptom, and it has to be seen in the context of people’s dissatisfaction with the status quo. It’s the same forces that created Brexit that have led to Jeremy and John so you can’t say, ‘if only Brexit hadn’t happened we could have had a clear run.’ They came in on the same wave – and now they have to find a way to disentangle themselves from that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344de79631722b23ffa1bdecb310e500ad49b16b/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a70a83e2fb01d0f0964339f7092cc4e9","title":"momentum wont block second brexit vote debate at labour conference","story":"More than 100 constituency parties want party to back a referendum on Brexit dealMomentum has said it will not block a debate on Brexit at the Labour conference, meaning the party could see members back a second referendum on the conference floor.Last year, Momentum steered its delegates to vote on other topics, including housing, the NHS and rail, to swerve a possible vote on single-market membership which could have exposed tensions between the Labour leadership and members.In Liverpool this year, that will not be repeated, Momentum’s national co-ordinator, Laura Parker, said. “Last year, the context was very different. Now, it’s absolutely inevitable there will be a discussion on conference floor, I can’t conceive there won’t be – we’re 200 days away,” she said. “Without a doubt, there has to be a debate.”More than 100 constituency Labour parties have submitted motions to the Labour conference calling for the party to back a referendum on any final Brexit deal, which campaigners believe is an unprecedented number.The drive has been spearheaded by a number of leftwing groups, including Another Europe is Possible, Remain Labour, Labour for a People’s Vote and the student group For Future’s Sake (FFS).The final motion put to Labour conference is likely to be a compromise thrashed out between delegates from CLPs that have submitted anti-Brexit motions, trade unions and the leadership.Labour’s governing national executive committee could also offer its own statement as a substitute, rather than risk being defeated on the conference floor in Liverpool by grassroots delegates who support a second referendum.Momentum has not backed a new referendum and is cautious about doing so. Parker’s instincts are clearly pro-Europe, but she is wary of restricting the Labour leadership’s political flexibility. “We are waiting to see what motions come to conference floor,” she said.Campaigners backing a second referendum have prepared comprehensive briefing packs for delegates and drop-in sessions during conference.“The red line is we have to have the phrase ‘people’s vote’ somewhere in the composite,” one campaigner said.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, an FFS co-founder, said the groups would co-ordinate their efforts. “The one cast-iron agreement across all the groups is that a people’s vote is the way to solve the crisis,” she said.Parker said she expected a compromise would be reached. “I don’t see a situation where Momentum says, ‘no, take this off the table.’ But that’s not the same of saying, ‘vote on the deal tomorrow’,” she said.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, have already suggested the party will keep the option on the table.“My view, then, is that we should have a general election because, in a general election, people can not only debate the range of issues in full, they can also select the team that will then negotiate our future position,” McDonnell told a Mumsnet chat on Tuesday.“If we can’t get a general election, we are keeping the option of another vote – a people’s vote – on the table.”• A special report by Jessica Elgot on the grassroots movement within Labour for a second referendum will be published online tomorrow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71286fd4c107facaf7daf535e12baf6670d84357/0_13_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fea9f16713f6a8e606da68fd39ca0f8","title":"salzburg speech after dinner theresa may brexit","story":"PM may have to wait until coffee is served to try to pitch Chequers plan to EU leadersTheresa May arrives in Salzburg at a time when the Brexit negotiations appear to be stalling over the Irish border question and a failure to respond positively to her Chequers proposals, knowing she will only have 10 minutes at the end of dinner to try to lift the mood.The buildup has not been ideal. On Tuesday night, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, made it clear that for all the talk of “de-dramatising” the backstop proposal, he is sticking to its fundamental principle that Northern Ireland will have to stay in the European customs union if no acceptable long-term trade deal can be negotiated, and there will have to be what he calls “technical checks and controls” down the Irish Sea.That, May has said repeatedly, with an eye on her allies in the Democratic Unionist party and the absence of a parliamentary majority, would amount to a compromise of the UK’s territorial integrity that no British prime minister could contemplate.The message, however, seems not to have got through to the EU27 – leaving No 10 to pin its hopes on the Salzburg summit. The diplomatic aim is for May to make the argument to her counterparts in person in the hope it will percolate and precipitate progress at the next European council meeting in October, after the Conservative party conference.As for the dinner on Wednesday, the Brussels briefing notes make it clear “the main topic of discussion will be migration”, not Brexit. It may not be until coffee is served that May has her chance to speak, a moment pointedly billed by the European commission as an address and not a discussion where an immediate reaction can be expected.What she will say was foreshadowed in an op-ed overnight, published not in a British newspaper but Germany’s Die Welt. “To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same,” May wrote.“Neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between different parts of the United Kingdom – which no other country would accept if they were in the same situation.”The hope is that she can persuade EU leaders to see the issue from her point of view and contemplate, when they return to discuss Brexit over lunch without her on Thursday, that the EU position on the backstop is not one she will be able to sell to her party, parliament or country – however much Barnier and others are focused on the integrity of the single market.No 10’s second, more political goal is to ensure May’s Chequers proposals for the UK’s future relationship with the EU also receive a hearing. The plan involves a long-term customs relationship with the EU, which would obviate the need for the backstop if it could be agreed and implemented soon after 2019, and includes the UK agreeing to share the a “common rulebook” for food and goods after Brexit, an idea hated by Boris Johnson and hard Brexiters for its perceived curtailing of British sovereignty.The nightmare scenario is that EU leaders will dismiss Chequers out of hand on Thursday afternoon as Salzburg wraps up, but that is highly unlikely, not least because EU leaders are painfully aware of May’s short-term political pressures. The fear is there will be a critical leak or hostile remark the hope is there will be some cautiously warm words from key figures at the press conferences that traditionally end these summits.Neither side expects Salzburg to amount to anything dramatic – the real negotiations will probably run between mid-October and mid-November – meaning every phrase and nuance will be closely scrutinised in an argument about interpretation that will set the tone for the prime minister’s trip to Birmingham in a week and a half’s time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749330599/DanSabbagh.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58572b31d1875465f407f672253b310e\" alt=\"Dan Sabbagh","title":"brexit salzburg eu summit theresa may tells tories not to look down on people in social housing politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including EU leaders arriving at Salzburg for the start of their informal summitSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has just issued a public response to Dominic Raab’s letter challenging him over Labour’s stance on a second referendum. (See 4.36pm.)This is from Sky’s Faisal Islam.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has recorded a clip about the Salzburg summit for broadcasters. And in it he suggested that, by being able to bypass Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiators, and deal with EU leaders directly, Theresa May could end up getting a more sympathetic response. He said:Theresa May has got the opportunity today, for the first time since we tabled the Chequers proposals, to sit down with all 27 European Union member states, not talking through the commission, but talking directly to the politicians that represent the populations of the European Union member states to explain to them how this Chequers proposal will work, how it’s the right deal, not just for the UK but for the European Union as well. I’m very confident that talking directly to the political leaders of the member states, the prime minister will get that message across today.Of course this is not going to be a decision making meeting today. But we’ve got a European council in October and confirmation today that we will have a special summit in November. And across that period of time I’m confident that we will be able to deliver for Britain this Chequers deal.This reflects a long-held UK government belief that Barnier has somehow been gold-plating EU red lines (to mix colour metaphors) and that, if only Number 10 could deal directly with Angela Merkel and others, a deal would be much easier.In Brussels this thinking as seen as delusional, not least because Barnier is bound by guidelines drafted by Merkel and her EU27 colleagues. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg alludes to that here.Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, has written an open letter to his Labour shadow, Sir Keir Starmer, challenging him to say that Labour would rule out another referendum on Brexit.Here is the key section.It’s vital that the British people have clarity and honesty from their elected representatives and, as such, it’s incumbent on you to answer the following questions, to give people a clear sense of Labour’s position:1. Will you respect the result of the referendum and rule out holding a second referendum?2. Will you rule out delaying Brexit and extending Article 50?3. If you propose to delay Brexit by extending Article 50, for how long? 4. What would the question be in your proposed second referendum? 5. All of this would require, as the original referendum did, legislation approved by both houses. When and how would you legislate for your proposed second referendum?While we work to deliver the instruction of the British people and get the right Brexit deal, people across the United Kingdom will be rightly concerned that Labour’s approach would invite the worst deal and take the country back to square one.And here is the full text.Starmer has not responded formally, but a Labour source said:Labour respects the result of the referendum and is not calling for a second referendum. With only weeks of Brexit negotiating time to go and no progress in sight, people would expect Dominic Raab to be getting on with the job of negotiating for Britain, not wasting time writing letters to the opposition.This is from Sky’s Mark Stone.Talking of the EPP, they’ve just tweeted this.This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg who’s in Salzburg.Earlier I summarised the People’s Vote paper (pdf) arguing that there is a “clear and viable” route to a second referendum on Brexit and that there are at least six plausible scenarios that could lead to the Commons voting for one. (See 12.24pm.) It’s a substantial document. But is it a persuasive one?Yes and no. On the plus side, it makes an important and under-appreciated point about the article 50 - that it can be delayed. When asked about a second referendum, one of Theresa May’s stock responses is to say that we’re leaving on 29 March and that’s it. But at the weekend the Sunday Times (paywall) reported that Philip Hammond, the chancellor, himself raised the prospect of delaying article 50 when the cabinet discussed Brexit last week. The paper also said Olly Robbins, May’s chief Brexit adviser, has raised the prospect in Brussels, where he was apparently told “Britain would have to make the request themselves.”And the People’s Vote paper is right to say that, despite frequent claims that parliament would not have enough time to pass referendum legislation, in fact, when pushed, parliament can and does pass complicated legislation quickly.So legislating for a referendum is certainly do-able. But, in practice, would the Commons ever vote for it? The People’s Vote paper gives six illustrations of how it could, but I can think of at least five weaknesses with their analysis.1 - Scenarios 1 and 2 (see 12.24pm) argue that a general, declaratory vote in the Commons (ie, not on legislation) would lead to a referendum because it would be “seen as binding on the government”. But that is not necessarily true. Under the coalition the government regularly used to ignore votes on backbench motions, and this government has taken that further, routinely ignoring votes on opposition day motions. The paper also claims (scenario 2) that a vote after 21 January, under the terms of the “meaningful vote” amendment accepted by the government in June, could include an amendment demanding a referendum because the speaker could allow that. But the whole point of having a motion “in neutral terms” (as the June amendment specifies) is to ensure that this is not allowed. That is why Brexiters like Jacob Rees-Mogg were happy to accept the June amendment.2 - Scenarios 4 and 5 are really just the same scenario - Theresa May changing her mind and ordering a second referendum. The prime minister has changed her mind in the past (eg, having a general election), but the paper probably glosses over just how improbable this would be given what May is saying about a second referendum now (eg, see 11.13am). Also, an announcement of this kind would probably trigger an immediate leadership challenger from Tory Brexiters.3 - Scenario 6 involves a general election - but what guarantee is there that either of the two main parties would offer a second referendum? The Tories aren’t likely to (see above). And Labour has repeatedly said that it accepts the result of the 2016 referendum and that its policy would be pursue an alternative, slightly softer Brexit, not to abandon it altogether. There are people in the party would would like it to oppose Brexit wholesale, but Jeremy Corbyn and his allies don’t agree at all. In fact, many in the party think Corbyn would be quite happy for the UK to be out of the EU by the time he takes power so that EU rules don’t constrain his economic agenda. This leads on to a broader problem with the analysis.4 - The People’s Vote paper ignores internal party politics. Most scenarios that involve the Commons voting for a second referendum assume Corbyn backing the idea, all the opposition parties voting in favour, and then a few Tories rebelling to help them over the line. Corbyn has not ruled out backing a second referendum, and there are some Tories in favour, but it is a mistake to think that the Labour party is united on this. Some of their MPs would certainly vote against a second referendum - remember, 15 of them advertised their pro-Brexit credentials in June by voting against an EEA amendment, when the party line was to abstain - and it is possible the Labour Brexiters would outnumber the Tory people’s voters. The People’s Vote paper points out that so far May has only lost two votes on Brexit in the Commons (on the Dominic Grieve “meaningful vote” amendment, and Phillip Lee’s relatively uncontentious amendment about the EEA medicines regulatory network.)5 - Scenario 3, involving MPs tabling a referendum amendment to the EU withdrawal agreement bill, seems the most probable option. But a bill would only be introduced if MPs had backed the withdrawal agreement in the first place, meaning that the best justification for a second referendum (parliamentary deadlock) no longer applied.Summary: A second referendum is certainly not impossible, and People’s Vote are right to highlight how straightforward it would be to suspend article 50. But their analysis downplays the parliamentary and political obstacles in the way, and to claim there are at least six “plausible” paths to a second referendum is probably stretching it a bit. “Conceivable” would probably be a more realistic description ...Tomorrow David Davis, who resigned as Brexit secretary because he opposed the Chequers plan, will deliver a speech in Munich. But he has released some extracts in advance, and they suggest he is escalating his attacks on the prime minister’s plan. Here are the key points.For me, the Chequers plan was always a non-starter. At Lancaster and Mansion House, the prime minister promised to return control over our law, our money and our borders. These promises were in our manifesto too. But the Chequers plan crosses on all of those red lines. The EU is often correctly described as having a democratic deficit. But Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether. We have been told that the Chequers proposal fulfils what the British people voted for. Well, I am afraid I simply do not buy that. There are some who say that they fear the UK becoming an aggressive free trade economy on the edge of Europe. My former counterpart Michel Barnier asserted: “How can we allow UK companies to have a significant competitive edge against EU companies?”My message here is also simple: it is not to fear, but instead embrace the opportunity that it will create for German workers, families and businesses large and small.In the long run, the friendly economic competition between neighbours is massively beneficial beneficial for the German companies whose supply chains will be provided with improved components from British factories beneficial for the consumers of tomorrow, who will enjoy the fruits of a more competitive global economy and beneficial for the students and entrepreneurs of all Europe.Theresa May will reject Michel Barnier’s revised Irish backstop border proposals at the Salzburg summit because the European Union is still insisting on customs checks down the Irish Sea if the two sides cannot strike a free trade agreement after Brexit.The prime minister foreshadowed the argument she will make to the other EU leaders over dinner this evening in an article in Die Welt, published on Wednesday morning, which said that the proposed backstop was “unacceptable” because it did not respect “the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK”.May will arrive in Salzburg this afternoon at an informal EU council which will May will address Brexit over dinner and where EU leaders will discuss the issue again at lunch on Thursday in May’s absence.The prime minister will also hold bilateral meetings on Thursday with the European council president, Donald Tusk, and the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, as she seeks to end the impasse over the future of the UK’s only land border.On Tuesday Barnier said he was making revised proposals as part of an attempt to ‘de-dramatise’ the issue, and tried to downplay them by describing them as “a set of technical checks and controls” and insisting that the EU respected the territorial integrity of the UK. (See 9.36am.)Barnier added that the bulk of the checks, for customs, VAT and excise, and other regulations could take place away from border points - although he conceded that increased sanitary checks for livestock may have to be done at the frontier.This is what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said about Brexit.The Brexit negotiations are entering the decisive phase. Various scenarios are still possible today, but I would like to stress that some of Prime Minister May’s proposals from Chequers indicate a positive evolution in the UK’s approach, as well as a will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit.By this I mean, among other things, the readiness to cooperate closely in the area of security and foreign policy.On other issues, such as the Irish question or the framework for economic cooperation, the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.Today there is perhaps more hope, but there is surely less and less time.Therefore every day that is left we must use for talks.I would like to finalise them still this autumn. This is what at tomorrow’s meeting of the 27 I will propose calling an additional summit around mid November.And here are the main points.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has just spoken to the media in Salzburg. He confirmed that there would be a special EU summit to finalise the Brexit deal in November.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, is due to speak to journalists soon ahead of the Salzburg summit.There will be a live feed here.Mel Stride, the Treasury minister, told Sky’s All Out Politics this morning that pro-Brexit Tories might decide to back a deal based on Chequers rather than risk a second referendum.When we have a firm deal on the table, I suspect that those to the right of the party - the pro-Brexit wing - will be very concerned that if that deal does not prevail, they will end up in the situation where we could have a second referendum or we could end up not leaving the EU altogether, so there is a danger of that happening if Chequers does not prevail. I think those on the other end of the spectrum will equally be very concerned that if Chequers does not prevail, we could end up in a no-deal situation.Sky’s Beth Rigby thinks Stride’s message was not very subtle.Tony Connelly, RTE’s Europe editor, has written a very good blog this morning explaining in detail what Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, means when he talks about offering the UK an improved offer on the Irish backstop. (See 9.36am.)Do read it in full, but essentially Connelly says Barnier told EU ministers last night that, under the backstop plan, there would have to be four types of checks on goods going between Britain (outside the customs union and single market) and Northern Ireland (which would effectively remain inside). They would be customs checks, VAT and excise duty checks, regulatory checks and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks.But only the SPS checks would have to take place at the border, Barnier said. All others could be done using technology and advance declarations, eliminating the need for inspections at the border.“This would have to increase substantially,” the official told RTÉ News.That is because, according to the chief negotiator, the remaining percentage moves through Dublin.In a post-Brexit scenario these goods would be subject to checks anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d55a8255d50370aa2c0b9442674d7be334d09059/26_86_1594_956/master/1594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6497390185d9cc909e2772255751eac","title":"england olly stone sri lanka odi tour","story":"The pace of Olly Stone is set to be unleashed on Sri Lanka’s batsmen after England handed Warwickshire’s fast but fragile right-armer a call-up for the one-day squad’s first overseas assignment of their winter.Stone has a claim to being the quickest bowler on the county circuit at present and with Liam Plunkett, a 50-over regular, permitted to miss the first fortnight of the upcoming five-match series due to a clash with his wedding, a chance to run the rule over a previously uncapped option has now presented itself.When fit, Stone has generally been running through Division Two line-ups with the red ball this season, claiming 34 wickets at 11 apiece from six matches. The 24 year old, who also trained with England during last winter’s Ashes tour, therefore is the eye-catching pick in a 16-man squad that will play five matches, starting in Dambulla on 10 October.Both Sam and Tom Curran are also included – the former following a breakthrough summer in Test cricket and as straight replacement for his fellow left-armer, David Willey, following a back injury – as is the fit-again Mark Wood. There is also a recall for Liam Dawson as an additional spin option for what are expected to be friendly conditions.Eoin Morgan’s side have 17 one-day internationals remaining before South Africa at the Oval on 30 May marks the start of next summer’s World Cup at home and having risen to No 1 in the rankings during a startling renaissance over the past three years, the captain and his head coach, Trevor Bayliss, are keen to keep a relatively settled squad.The clash with Plunkett’s impending nuptials – caused by a switch around in the one-day and Test legs of the tour after a date was booked in – offers Stone a chance to make a late play for next summer’s showpiece event and though Sri Lankan pitches may not be a natural fit, England are keen to inject more pace into their attack.The former Northamptonshire seamer’s List A record to date is admittedly quite modest with 23 wickets at 38 from only 25 matches. But England have looked beyond the numbers and instead focused on the attributes, which despite a troubling back catalogue of injuries still make him capable of hitting speeds in the mid-90s from a 6ft 3in frame.This is testament to Stone’s perseverance, having battled back from an eye-watering knee injury suffered in 2016 when innocuously jumping to celebrate the wicket of Moeen Ali during a T20 Blast fixture. It snapped his anterior cruciate ligament, before he tried to bowl a follow-up delivery and tore the cartilage as well.A move to Edgbaston that winter, while still on crutches, represented a gamble by Warwickshire and though 2017 was a stop-start affair – his performance on T20 Blast Finals Day being the standout – this season has witnessed an improved fitness record.With Stone’s county teammate Chris Woakes ready to the lead the attack once more, having missed the entire white-ball section of the summer through injury, Wood fit again, both Curran brothers selected and Plunkett available for the fourth and fifth matches, cracking the XI will be tricky, not least since the pitches may dictate Dawson plays.It was a tour to Sri Lanka before the last World Cup that saw England’s already outdated plans go awry, with Alastair Cook’s poor form on tour leading to his removal as captain and Ben Stokes dropped when both aspects of his game fell apart in conditions that were far removed from what they were due to encounter in Australia and New Zealand.This time around the hosts are the ones in something of a funk, however, having won only 13 of their last 46 matches in the past two years, suffered series defeats at home to Zimbabwe, India and South Africa, and dropped to eighth in the world rankings as a result.England have surprisingly held off from naming the squad for the one-off Twenty20 in Colombo on 27 October, given the logistics mean only a couple of changes are expected, while their plans for the Test series that follows are due next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c322143d9124fc3e42ac60b2f940ee347ccee57/159_349_3370_2023/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73825e015eba77c533929712dccdca05","title":"tiger woods europe ryder cup","story":"A ringing endorsement of the strength of Europe’s team for next week’s Ryder Cup has arrived from Tiger Woods, the most high-profile member of the United States contingent who will seek to retain the trophy in France.Woods, speaking at East Lake on the eve of the PGA Tour’s season-ending Tour Championship, will play in his first Ryder Cup since 2012 after receiving a wildcard pick from Jim Furyk. When asked whether odds-on American favouritism for the biennial event and the widespread analysis that this is one of their strongest ever teams was valid, the 14-times major champion indulged in what could be interpreted as mind games.“No, I think the European side is one of the best they’ve ever had,” said Woods. “We have a solid team, but so do the Europeans. It plays out over three days. It’s about playing well at the right time and partnering up well at the right time and making putts. I think both teams are very deep this year going into the event, so it’s going to be a lot of fun for both sides.”Woods reflected candidly on six years ago, when Europe staged a famous Sunday comeback at Medinah. As Martin Kaymer holed the putt to keep the Ryder Cup in Europe, one match ahead Woods’s singles tie against Francesco Molinari was all but immaterial. “It was tough because we had a four-point lead starting out the day on Sunday,” the 42 year old recalled. “I had worked my way back against Francesco. I was one down with a few to go, I turned the match and I was one up. I thought my match would be the deciding point. Some of the guys had some tough losses.“I have missed playing in it, missed competing in it. I’ve been a part of these teams now for the better part of 20 years. To have earned the confidence of my teammates and my captain to have been selected is something that gives me a lot of excitement going into the cup.”Over the coming four days, Woods can concern himself with inidual matters. His rapid recovery from a fourth back surgery to the point where he is one of only 30 players who have qualified for the Tour Championship is stunning in itself. “When I was laying on the ground and couldn’t move for a number of months, golf was the furthest thing from my mind,” he said. “It’s great to have accomplished one of the goals I set out at the beginning of the year, to make it back to East Lake to be part of the Tour Championship. I’ve accomplished that. Now I want to get the win and then head into next week at the Ryder Cup.“It’s not going to rank up there as one of my top seasons because I didn’t win eight or nine times in a season I didn’t win two to three majors in a year. But to have accomplished what I’ve accomplished and to have gotten through what I’ve gotten through to get back to this point is something I’m very proud of.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11d63430fba2f77c678ab7cec79e384d1c69fe8f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25f9de7c57528299b1a380c655b63ac","title":"rugby union international power rankings all blacks","story":"A year from the World Cup New Zealand look good for a hat-trick of wins but Ireland, South Africa and Wales are all on the rise with England and Australia heading in the other directionDefeat by South Africa in Wellington reminded the world that the All Blacks can be beaten – no bad thing with 12 months to go until the World Cup – but they are still the overwhelming favourites for a third straight crown. They weren’t brilliant against France over the summer but then thrashed Australia twice, displaying an ability to find a gear their opponents cannot live with. It will be fascinating to see their response to defeat do they add a dose of pragmatism to their blistering style, or do they double down? If the bigger picture continues to pose problems – New Zealand Rugby is expecting to make consistent losses from 2020 onwards and as Lima Sopoaga recently said, the player drain to Europe is not going to stop – Steve Hansen’s side are still setting a considerable pace.Sitting pretty as Europe’s leading lights, having followed up their Six Nations grand slam with a first series win in Australia for 39 years. The Wallabies’ subsequent struggles should not detract from that feat and make no mistake, Ireland’s November match against New Zealand is the headline fixture this autumn, rather than events at Twickenham a week previous. As ever, so much rests on the shoulders of Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton so the former’s neck injury is a concern. But it is only fine-tuning between now and the World Cup for Joe Schmidt and not many of his counterparts can say that.The Springboks are anything but dull under Rassie Erasmus. A series win over England having been 24-3 down inside 20 minutes of the first Test was followed by a home win against Argentina, away defeats by Australia and the Pumas and Erasmus claiming he was one loss away from the sack. He was exaggerating but one thing is clear: Erasmus knew only too well the empowering effect beating the All Blacks would have and set about achieving it as soon as the series against England was won. One swallow does not make a summer and all that – and the rematch in Pretoria will be a colossal Test – but the Springboks have shown the world that New Zealand are fallible. Their World Cup track record cannot be ignored, either.Coming to the boil nicely. Warren Gatland has been true to the more expansive game plan he began to introduce on the tour of New Zealand in 2016, has been helped by the emergence of the Scarlets as a European force and Wales are reaping the rewards. Sam Warburton’s retirement is unquestionably a setback but they have a wealth of openside options and Alun Wyn Jones is a fine leader. What they wouldn’t give for a November win against Australia, who are in the same World Cup pool, to further demonstrate their progress, for they have not beaten the Wallabies at the last 13 attempts.So many questions hang over Eddie Jones’s England side. To name just three: what is his preferred back row, back three and who is his No 1 fly-half? The appointment of John Mitchell only adds intrigue and breaks the mould of Jones’s previous choices as assistants. The hope must be that after a run of five defeats in six Tests, Mitchell who has a reputation for not suffering fools lightly, has the kind of impact Jones himself did when he first arrived. What can be said with certainty is that England cannot afford anything other than victory against the Springboks on 3 November. Defeat and they will be staring down the barrel with the All Blacks next up at Twickenham. Win both though, and everything will appear rosy again.Whether you consider it bad luck or bad officiating, it is hard to read too much into their summer series against New Zealand other than they still don’t seem to quite be fit enough to compete with the very best. Certainly, they are getting better though and some early-season performances in the Top14 bode well. Clermont in particular look mightily impressive and the significance of their Champions Cup absence should not be ignored when you consider how many of their France internationals were injured last season and how they will be able to have a regular rest during this campaign. What looked a relatively comfortable autumn against South Africa, Argentina and Fiji just got a fair bit harder but three home wins is eminently achievable.These are bleak times for the Wallabies. A first home defeat by Argentina in 35 years has seen them plummet to their lowest world ranking. Michael Cheika has an air of resignation about him and Lukhan Tui has said that he will not play again this year after an unsavoury incident with a supporter. If there are any glimmers of hope then Australia will be vastly improved when Samu Kerevi and Tevita Kuridrani both return from injury to add ballast to their midfield and it would help if Cheika had a fly-half at his disposal in any kind of form. But whereas once their backline was lethal, now they look in a collective fug.Hard to escape the fact that their summer tour, as with the Six Nations, left you wondering if they have the consistency to string a World Cup campaign together. They won handsomely in Argentina but the Pumas were dreadful all summer, and then lost to the USA. Still, when the stars align, as was the case against England at Murrayfield, they will take some stopping. The key for Gregor Townsend is to get them winning when not playing their best and overcoming the departure of the forwards coach Dan McFarland will not be easy. They are also in that awkward position where they appear to be competing against the host nation for second place in their pool.In just a couple of months Argentina have made improvements significant enough to cause England, who occupy the same World Cup pool, considerable concern. Put bluntly, they were awful in defeat to Scotland and Wales over the summer but since Daniel Hourcade has been replaced by Mario Ledesma the transformation has been rapid. It may seem strange to praise a side for conceding 46 points but they impressed in defeat by the All Blacks and have beaten both South Africa and Australia so far in the Rugby Championship. They appear to have brought some semblance to their policy on selecting overseas-based players too, and have a habit of peaking for World Cups.They won a fourth straight Pacific Nations Cup over the summer but then lost at home to Tonga soon after, which will not have gone down well. Before that things were looking good for John McKee’s side – they had edged past Samoa, then thrashed Georgia with a stronger side. Autumn matches against Scotland, Uruguay and France await and McKee has been in Europe recently, casting his eye on the wealth of talent available. We know what Fiji will bring to next year’s party – just look at what Semi Radrada did to England for the Barbarians.Japan boast impressive wins over Tonga, Italy and Georgia over the past 12 months as well as an eye-catching draw away against France. Only one host nation has failed to make it past the pool stages – no prizes for guessing who – and optimism is rife in Japan they will not be the second.Victory over Fiji in Suva is a fine result to hang their hats on. Charles Piutau wants to play for them in Japan – that’s unlikely – but Tonga will cause their pool rivals problems next year. Plenty of stereotypes about the Pacific Island teams exist but there is no doubt that at World Cups, with far more time to prepare, they are all formidable opponents.Ranked 15th in the world after a narrow win over Japan in June ended a run of eight straight defeats. They have not won a Six Nations match in 17 attempts and that must end next year if they have any designs on the World Cup quarter-finals. Conor O’Shea can at least take heart from the early-season form of Benneton and Zebre.Unbeaten in 2018 having won their last seven matches including the considerable scalp of Scotland over the summer, during which Harlequins’ new signing Paul Lasike caught the eye. Gary Gold appears to be making an impact.Still in limbo as a side too good for the second tier of European rugby but not allowed into the first. Lost to Japan 28-0 in June which is a concerning result but play Italy on 10 November – the perfect opportunity to restate their case for Six Nations inclusion.Samoa were not helped by the drawn-out saga over Spain and Romania fielding ineligible players in that they had to wait until July to complete their playoff against Germany. They duly won it but other results have been sub-standard recently, while Germany, under the temporary charge of Mike Ford, head into November’s repechage along with Hong Kong, Kenya and Canada, who are the favourites to advance. Elsewhere, Namibia contest their sixth straight tournament and are still looking for their first win while Uruguay qualified without having to go via the repechage for the first time since 2003 after beating Canada over two legs. Russia profited from the SpainRomania debacle and will play Japan in next year’s curtain-raiser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61253ea0bbe6c86240146c7d76e88d02894a5a83/0_171_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba8ac157c83826029a758a1d4843022b","title":"wada russia doping ban athletics","story":"The World Anti-Doping Agency is set to ignore the clamour from outraged athletes and national doping federations and relax its ban on RussiaHas a performance ever felt less enhanced than that of World Anti-Doping Agency? The body notionally responsible for keeping sport clean is on the brink of lifting Russia’s doping ban, about 10 minutes after that country’s state agents were discovered to have spent much of the Sochi Winter Olympics passing clean piss through a hole in a testing lab wall, and swapping it with athlete piss marginally less tainted than the lake inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone.But hey. Russia would like you to know that they’re just not those people anymore. I imagine the speech requesting readmittance to the fold ran along the lines of Paul Calf’s on his ex-girlfriend. “I’d do anything to get her back. I’d give up drinking. Well, I’d cut down … on spirits … in the week. The point is I’d CHANGE.”And so with Russia, who have made a small series of will-this-do gestures to imply they wouldn’t try anything like the whole state-sponsored shadow-lab thing again. Sure, it could be regarded as slightly unfortunate that it was revealed only last week that two Russian agents were intercepted on their way to break into a Swiss chemical weapons lab. But just because Russia has a load of do-or-die merchants willing to do the old switcheroo with some nerve agent, it doesn’t mean they wouldn’t piously draw the line at handling bobsledder wee.That, certainly, seems to be Wada’s position on this, though it will make its final decision , at a meeting in Seychelles. (Where else?)Before we go on, then, a recap on where we find ourselves. Back in 2016, when Russia was discovered to have masterminded the biggest doping scandal of the 21st century, it was decreed that the only way back in to\u0026nbspcompetition for this sporting pariah was to\u0026nbspcomply fully with all the conditions of Wada’s so-called roadmap, which include accepting the findings of the McLaren report into the affair, and granting Wada access\u0026nbspto Moscow’s anti-doping laboratory. Which I urge\u0026nbspyou not to picture as a single phone ringing out in an\u0026nbspempty office.Alas, in a shocking development – anticipated by only a few million realists – Russia has not complied with those two conditions. And incredibly (except not), Wada’s solution to that appears to be to change its own conditions. If Russia won’t comply with what you’ve asked for, change what you ask for, right? That way compliance of a sort has happened. To wit, Wada has complied with Russia, rather than the other way round.Or as Wada itself put it: “The fact is that leadership requires flexibility. The proposals … are grounded in pragmatism and are nuanced interpretations of the roadmap in order to bring matters to a conclusion and to not allow the significant progress that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) has made over the last two years, under Wada’s supervision, to be undone.” A statement which clumsily implies that Rusada would simply abandon even its own window-dressing if not fasttracked back.Alas, while this might all be highly acceptable to Rusada, it is not acceptable to a growing list of outraged athletes, who have signed a letter saying so. It is not acceptable to former cross-country skier Beckie Scott, who has resigned from Wada’s compliance review committee over the development. And it is not acceptable to the Institute of National Anti-Doping Organisations, the testing agency alliance who this week released a statement declaring: “Any reasonable person would conclude that Russia has not yet fulfilled its obligations to the global sporting community.”Well quite. The only entity who has fulfilled its obligations to the global sporting community even less is Wada, who has spent the best part of two decades phoning it in, and still can’t seem to understand why people might imagine it a hopeless case.Anyone paying attention will long ago have lost count of the times Wada has undermined its own credibility. To pluck a single example from the air, let’s journey back to 2013, when a whistleblower informed it that Jamaica’s testing programme had in effect not operated in the five or six months leading up to the 2012 Olympics. Having been initially swatted away by the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission, Wada finally contrived to organise an extraordinary audit of procedures. They arrived on the island late one Monday night, and were on a plane out first thing Wednesday. “I have a personal problem in what you can do in 12 hours,” Jamaica’s most senior drug tester, Dr Paul Wright, later told the BBC. “They were only really here on Tuesday, and four hours of that was at a dinner function with the prime minister.”It is not for us to speculate on the dinners that have now led Wada to drop its own demands of Russia. But the reality is simple: most people with a passing knowledge of anti-doping simply don’t believe what they are seeing half the time they watch sport.Much of this is specifically the fault of Wada, whose failure to enforce even its own demands undermines not just its own existence, but the entire believability of international sporting competition. It’s bad enough when the cheats do it, but when the body designed to stop them cheating is as helpfully quarter-arsed as this, perhaps the time has come to inquire again after its continuing point? Otherwise Russia has found just another way to take the piss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a04f3c978ec47f15d81b9d368822a11235dd69/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ed8ac41df1ee6c48fb2127e8dd77e5c","title":"nfl rooney rule coaching statistics","story":"The NFL’s Rooney Rule has helped minority head coaches advance their careers. But the racial disparity between offensive and defensive coordinators has never been greaterAs the NFL opened another season earlier this month, eight of the NFL’s 32 teams featured a minority head coach, which tied for the most in league history. The Rooney Rule – which requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for open head coaching and senior football operation roles – has seen a number of minorities climb the NFL coaching ladder in the past two decades.Since the Rooney Rule has been implemented, a new racial ide has opened up: Minority coaches have had more success finding jobs on defense, while white coaches are preferred for their expertise on offense. Of the eight minority head coaches to start this season, three-quarters of them have predominantly defensive backgrounds. In contrast, two thirds of the rest of the league’s head coaches come from offensive backgrounds. And this is not a one-off: Since 2003, white coaches with a background in offense have outnumbered those with a defensive background in all but three years.The racial disparity between the offensive and defensive side of the ball does not stop with head coaches. Of the 32 offensive coordinators on opening weekend, 31 were white, while a record 12 minority defensive coordinators marched the sideline. Why has this rise in minority coaches come from just one side of the ball?At the other five offensive positions recorded by Tides – quarterback, tight end, offensive guard, offensive tackle, and center at least 40 percent of players were white. While there have been minor fluctuations, that data has stayed more or less consistent in the 15 years for which Tides collected data. Considering a vast majority of coordinators are NFL veterans, it should come as no surprise that those splits are reflected in the coaching ranks as well.Even though you won’t catch scouts and organizational decision-makers saying race factors into who is drafted to play what position, most football followers, from youth leagues all the way up to the NFL, have an idea of what players at each position should embody. Wide receivers need speed and height running backs need burst and toughness quarterbacks need savvy and intelligence centers need to be the brain of the offensive line. Most of these players are pushed into these roles well before the NFL even knows they exist. There hasn’t been a white NFL cornerback since Jason Sehorn back in 2003. Vanderbilt University head coach Derek Mason – an African-American who spent his NFL days as a wide receiver, primarily for the Titans and Ravens – told the Undefeated they don’t even exist in the high school ranks. “I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen one. I’m talking years. If I see a 6ft 2in dude out there who can play corner, who has got great hips and can move, I’ll take him. I don’t care what color he is. They’re just not there.”It’s not a coincidence that these positional differences are split by racial lines. In his seminal 1973 work Sociology of Sport, Dr Harry Edwards outlines a concept called centrality, which shows how players of most importance – those who touch the ball most and make executive decisions – play in the most central positions. In baseball, he found a simple solution to answer the question of which positions were central: he ranked them by defensive assists. Indeed, the percentage of white players at a position was directly proportional to the total number of assists it converted. The logic makes sense too. Catchers are considered the field general of baseball. Shortstops and second basemen are the leaders of the infield, and outfielders are selected for their speed and arm strength above all.Despite the fact that you won’t see NFL decision-makers be openly racist in their process, these age-old biases routinely rear their ugly heads. Before the 2014 NFL draft, Reuben Fischer-Baum, Aaron Gordon and Billy Haisley of Deadspin compiled a database of the words NFL, CBS and ESPN writers used to describe black and white prospects. Different narratives formed based on an athlete’s skin color. The prevalence of legacy hires tells you everything you need to know about how these stereotypes can last so long and become so congealed in NFL culture. It cannot be enough, then, to accept the excuses that NFL decision-makers are merely sticking to what has worked. That definition of what worked still relies on the same racist and essentialist assumptions about bodies and intelligence that drove the creation of those stereotypes decades ago. And the Rooney Rule, no matter how well intentioned, will never be enough to fix the damage that was done by coaches or scouts working under those same assumptions 20 years prior. For now, men like Mike Tomlin, Vance Joseph and Steve Wilks are leading a generation of black head coaches who can challenge racial assumptions around leadership and intelligence and prove they’re capable of performing and deserving of these chances. But if the NFL sideline is ever going to look like the men who suit up every Sunday, it’s going to take more than ersity initiatives from the top. These problems represent generations-old biases that have burrowed deep within the minds of players, assistants, coaches and scouts from coast to coast and from the youth level up through the professional ranks, and fixing it will take deep reflection and conscious action from the white men who remain overrepresented in positions of power. The real question will be if enough of them are willing to take that step."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cdfff1e2c971bea82c1defb6296ffaae81c9760/68_0_5022_3016/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab600692997934ec74ec15696c0e6bbf","title":"denis norden the king of the blooper who always delivered","story":"The host of It’ll Be Alright on the Night also had a celebrated career with his writing partner Frank Muir, and understood the art of television like few of his peersAlthough his most popular venture – ITV’s It’ll Be Alright on the Night – featured examples of television going embarrassingly wrong, Denis Norden, who has died aged 96, was himself such a skilled writer and performer that he sustained a 60-year career in the medium: from co-writing Gerry’s Inn, a 1947 BBC drama, to All The Best From Denis Norden, an ITV tribute on his retirement in 2006.It’ll Be Alright on the Night was inspired by the so-called “blooper reels”, featuring fluffs and trips by actors, or misbehaving props, which had previously been played at industry Christmas parties. In the early years of the medium – when most shows were broadcast live – mistakes caused a brief blush increased pre-recording, though, began to amass a cock-up vault containing takes marked “NG”, meaning “no good”.In September 1977, a first collection of these was shared with the ITV audience, beginning with a black-and-white clip of a cigarette-lighting American actor accidentally putting the match to the nose of another cast-member. It continued with a sequence of actors, including Roger Moore, speaking bleeped-out swearwords after forgetting their lines.The grey-suited Norden, wearing thickly black-framed spectacles, delivered a wry script that typically invited the audience to empathise with the possibility for disaster. The phrase “you know how it is when you’re …” underscored by a rumbling pre-chuckle signalled what was coming next. The tape of the first show has Norden fluffing a sentence in the opening link, but it was broadcast, presumably because it was thought too ironic, in front of a studio audience. But the formula proved so successful that Norden hosted 16 editions, attracting, in the days of only three or four channels, audiences of up to 18 million.The presenter’s relish for introducing clips of actors mis-delivering scripts may have come from the fact that the earlier part of his career had involved writing them. With Frank Muir, he wrote the BBC radio series Take it From Here and then, for one of its stars, Jimmy Edwards, the public-school-set TV sitcom, Whack-O!. Muir and Norden also wrote gags and sketches for performers including Peter Sellers and David Frost.Curiously, they have received insufficient recognition for their most enduring line. “Infamy! Infamy! They’ve all got it in for me!” spoken by Kenneth Williams as Julius Caesar in Carry on Cleo, appeared in the screenplay credited to Talbot Rothwell. However, mildly riled by the line’s increasing inclusion in lists of The Best Cinema Gags Ever,Muir and Norden revealed, in a letter to a newspaper, that they had one day received a phone call from their old friend Rothwell asking if he could recycle a cherished “infamy  in for me” pun from one of their old radio scripts. Being nice men, they agreed, expecting to hear nothing more of it.Even more gallingly, Norden’s own attempt to become a Hollywood screenwriter – with films including The Bliss of Mrs Blossom– failed, sending him back to TV. In one of his last interviews, he lamented that the job of “gag writer” was vanishing, as most modern comics now write their own material. In fact, though, Muir and Norden had themselves been early examples of writer-performers, developing on-screen careers in a way that, for example, other writing pairs of the period, such as Ray Galton and Alan Simpson (Hancock, Steptoe and Son), never did.The pair never performed as a formal double-act – although they made joint appearances on chatshows and panel programmes such as My Word! – but, on the surface at least, they had the sharp visual and vocal contrast common to comedy duos. Both men served in the Royal Air Force during the second world war, but Muir, with his signature bowtie, sounded officer class, while Norden, retaining the accent of his native east London, suggested the ranks. Muir always pointed out that this was an illusion – he had not been born posh – but their distinctive deliveries, enhanced by Muir’s soft lisp and Norden’s slightly nasal tone, made them popular targets for impressionists and Spitting Image.A little uncomfortably for someone whose main role at ITV was to poke fun at television going wrong, Norden was tangentially involved in an example of it. In 1978, he and Muir wrote (based on an earlier radio version) The Glums, a half-hour domestic sitcom that was one of the segments of Bruce’s Big Night, a catastrophically received attempt to base the entire ITV peak-time Saturday schedule around Bruce Forsyth.Although absent from TV in the last decade of his life, Norden retained a legacy and presence through reboots. Just three weeks before his death, David Walliams became the second successor to Norden (following Griff Rhys Jones) in another peak-time ITV revival of It’ll Be Alright on the Night. Fittingly, the edition of Private Eye published on the day of Norden’s death included a punchline punning on the “infamy!” line.These were worthy tributes to a man who, unlike the unfortunate performers who were the fodder for It’ll Be Alright on the Night, reliably delivered time after time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f55d3da2540976c61e77b3b6c6021add3c3bce9/71_520_5799_3480/master/5799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49a534f4509d93d40770943ef81d969f","title":"surprise truce brokered by turkey and russia spares idlib for now","story":"Surprise initiative welcome respite for Syrian opposition and people of the provinceRelieved locals and rebel groups in Idlib have been trying to unpick details of an eleventh-hour truce that excludes much of the northern Syrian province from a Russian-led attack for at least one month and sets up a buffer zone intended to shield 3 million civilians.The surprise initiative, brokered by Turkey and Russia on Monday, assuages fears of an immediate widespread humanitarian catastrophe and sets the scene for a swathe of northern Syria to remain out of central government control indefinitely.The arrangement strengthens the role of Turkish-backed rebels in the northern province, and is likely to lead hardline groups to make a tactical retreat to southern Idlib where, for now, they will remain out of the sights of Russian and Syrian guns.The move is a welcome respite for Syrian opposition groups, who had feared a massive attack aimed at returning the final rebel-held province to central government control, allowing Bashar al-Assad to clinch victory in the seven-year war.As momentum built towards an attack, Assad’s backers, Russia and Iran, grew increasingly wary of the political price they would end up paying by bringing about a humanitarian crisis unlike any other in the Syrian war.Weeks of belligerent rhetoric from Tehran and Moscow had increasingly softened in recent days and been replaced by common ground with Ankara – a central backer of what remains of the anti-Assad opposition, which has increasingly muscled in on northern Syria and saw its own interests unravelling if chaos was ignited along its border.“Civilians in Idlib think this is a good deal, they feel hopeful and happy concerning it,” said Mahmoud Abbi, a spokesperson for Free Idlib Police, a rebel-backed local police force. “We are grateful for Turkey’s efforts to prevent the Russian and Assad attack on Idlib. However … we do not trust Russia about the deal. But for now it is better than displacement or bombing.“The deal is for Turkey’s security but it is also face-saving for Putin and by association Assad,” he said. “Iran refused to participate in this attack because of its own bad military and economic situation. The Assad regime is weak and has no ability to attack without the help of Iranian militias.”The Assad regime was not represented at the bilateral summit between Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the Russian resort town of Sochi, and not was it present at a trilateral summit with Iran in Tehran one week ago. The Syrian government had no immediate response to the development, which appears likely to consolidate Turkey’s presence in the north, giving Erdogan a stronger hand in managing the final stages of the war – and aftermath.Central to the truce is the removal of an extremist coalition from the buffer zone, the dimensions of which are yet to be finalised. Turkish and Russian intelligence officials will soon meet to thrash out the numbers of radical rebels required to leave the province. The agreement suggests that those who agree to exit will be given safe passage to the eastern Hama desert region.Jawad Abdel Karim, 40, a spokesman for the Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) umbrella group of hardline fighters, said his organisation is, for now, expected to retreat up to 7km (4.3 miles) away from the agreed demarcation point. Forces loyal to the Assad regime, meanwhile, would retreat 10km away. “Give or take, the distance between the opposition and regime will be 15km,” he said.The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammed Zarif, said he welcomed the apparent breakthrough, adding weight to a growing belief that the deal, or a variation of it, would hold. “Intensive responsible diplomacy over the last few weeks-pursued in my visits to Ankara and Damascus, followed by the Iran-Russia-Turkey Summit in Tehran and the meeting in Sochi-is succeeding to avert war in Idlib with a firm commitment to fight extremist terror. Diplomacy works,” Zarif wrote on Twitter.HTS, and earlier incarnations of it, has been a significant presence throughout Idlib for the past three years. It has been particularly strong in the south, but has attempted to impose austere theocratic rule in many towns and cities. The numbers of ideologically driven fighters in its ranks have been difficult to gauge. Thousands of men had joined the organisation because of its strength. But as its momentum wanes, the powerful group is starting to lose impetus in some parts of Idlib.While parts of Idlib appeared to rally behind the truce, not all were convinced that it would hold. “Although we agree with the points mentioned in the agreement between Erdoğan and Putin, have they ever got a result before?” asked Abu Wissam, 32. “Civilians on the ground are still living in fear and worry. We’re all hesitant and we’re all doubtful. And we have nothing to say any more. Our voices went hoarse with demands and no one listened.”Another Idlib local, Ahmed Hallaq, 34, said: We had bigger dreams and goals than this agreement. All of Syria should have been safe from the Assad regime and his militias, not just a buffer zone. Lots of my friends around here think the same. We don’t trust the regime, we have zero trust in its morals and promises. They violated most, if not everything else that’s been agreed on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f219d5e88cc414f2125b62ed96eba09027b409/87_52_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1512414a95e83fe3c3983a37e89bfe45","title":"cathay pacific spells its name wrong on side of plane","story":"Boeing 777-367 was spotted in Hong Kong with missing ‘F’ after flight from ChinaCathay Pacific has given visitors to Hong Kong airport a surprise by spelling its name wrong on the side of a plane.

In wealthier Monkey Junction, it’s a different storyShacory Blanks didn’t know Hurricane Florence was coming towards her home in Wilmington, North Carolina, until just hours before landfall. The 31-year-old doesn’t have a television – she can’t afford one – and she doesn’t listen to the radio. Her nephew told her about it.But as the wind howled outside there was added danger in this part of town: bullets zipping by outside her window in the Houston Moore housing complex.Family and friends crowded a front porch strewn with children’s bicycles scooters and cleaning spray, watching an American Red Cross van at the end of the block hand out a hot meal of rice and ground hamburger with a side of green beans and whole wheat bread.“If I have to eat one more meal of rice and beans …” Blanks trailed off, standing on her mother’s porch. One of her nephews sat by the bottom of the uneven brick steps, eating his meal, and shrugged.Blanks’s mother is the only person in the family to have power, so Blanks has moved in to her apartment, along with most of her family.She contemplated driving over to Monkey Junction, a mostly white neighborhood, where electricity is back in most parts and restaurants are serving people until the 8pm curfew, to get a hot meal with the $90 she has to her name.Where Blanks is standing now, Wilmington’s Northside, is a historically and predominantly African American neighborhood. On any given street, sitting on porches, most people are out during the day, for a brief respite from the suffocating heat.A couple of miles down the road, past the perfectly painted and mowed lawns just blocks away from Blanks’s childhood home, Peggy White, who lives near Monkey Junction, was sitting at a counter at an air-conditioned Whole Foods that opened up again on Monday with hot macaroni and cheese and chicken teriyaki. White hoped to charge her phone because the one thing Blanks’s family had that she didn’t was power.Other than that, 63-year-old White had an undamaged home, a full tank of gas, and all the free wifi she could want. A recent transplant from Maryland, White has weathered Hurricanes Matthew and Florence unharmed.When Florence made landfall, White’s friends out of state kept her updated with news of road closures and open grocery stores. A friend had told her about the reopening of Whole Foods.Near the Whole Foods, another grocery store opened, as well as a gas station with long lines. A Dunkin’ Donuts couldn’t sling hot donuts and iced coffees at its customers fast enough.A 2016 UNC report called Wilmington’s schools “hyper-segregated” between black and white. They’re not the only aspect of life segregated, seemingly, in Wilmington. Now the recovery efforts since Hurricane Florence’s departure have served to highlight disparities among residents.In Blanks’s neighborhood, unlike the one down the street, there is no open grocery store with air-conditioning to hang out in – just a small convenience store with cigarettes, beer and wine on most shelves. “I think they’re going crazy or delusional because the easiest thing to get right now is drugs. Everybody is smoking and drinking, but there’s no food being put in their body to balance them,” Blanks said.Blanks was born and raised on Wilmington’s Northside, where the median income is between $14,000 and $17,000 a year, said Good Works volunteer Kristen McKeithan, 39, as she walked by to let people know that hot meals were available at the local community college. That is well below the city average of $43,855, according to US census data.Many residents feels the recovery from Florence is taking place more slowly in the Northside than others parts of town. Joseph Cobbs, who grew up in this neighborhood, has a theory why.“They don’t want you to come up. Look at where you at right now. All the white people around us got power. We got none,” he yelled over the roaring generator, sitting in a broken white plastic lawn chair in a friend’s front yard. That one and two others are powering the entire block. “No one comes to help us. So we help ourselves.”The generator at Cobbs’s friend’s house turned off three times in 10 minutes. Without pause, the retired military man’s friend fired it up again before the duo hopped into a truck. Cobbs limped into the passenger seat – he has a spinal injury – to hunt for work to pay for gas to keep the generators going. They need to keep it running for the neighborhood to use.At her mother’s house, just down the road from Cobbs, Blanks agreed. “That’s just the way it always is. Their neighborhoods get fixed up first around here, their streets get fixed up first around here,” she said. “When the power goes out, they go to them first.”Blanks counted down the days she can go back to work. She’s not getting paid during her days off after the hurricane. The thousand dollars a month she makes after taxes covers her rent and bills, with just enough for food. She makes too much to qualify for food stamps, she said.White, in Monkey Junction, had lunch at Whole Foods, charged some electronics, and was hoping to go back to work at the airport on Wednesday, where she works in customer service for Delta.“It’s my retirement job. I was a teacher,” she explained. She doesn’t have to work, even though she offered to go back in. “I’ve gotta start living a normal life while you can and go back to work. I do it for fun.”In thriving historic downtown Wilmington, neighbors are also helping neighbors, but the atmosphere is different. Co-owner of gastropub The Husk, Justin Smith, 46, was doling out beer, hot dogs, and burgers on Sunday for regulars. Loud, crowded and festive, the atmosphere resembled a block party as people spilled on to the sidewalk. “Everyone around us helped us in some way, whether it was gas, buns, or wings,” he explained.” And we got the Panthers on, and it has been a really unifying effort.”Blanks hasn’t had meat since before the storm. “I’m dying for meat. A nice juicy T-bone steak that I cook myself. They say there are some places out there in Monkey Junction that are open,” she said, getting ready to drive around looking for food in the wealthier parts of town.Her friend, Sherrel Porter, 31, chimed in: “Mashed potatoes and corn!” Then, with a smirk, she added: “After this hurricane, I might as well go vegan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24ec87de30c94e2524ce58697fbb4daab16ab32e/0_189_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e78a5fea6a871d6f0d6c92925d831ed4","title":"north korea shut missile test summit kim jong un moon","story":"Moon Jae-in says leaders have agreed to steps they say will lead to a nuclear-free peninsula, and Kim pledges to visit SeoulNorth Korea will shut down key missile test facilities in the presence of “international experts” and is willing to close its only known nuclear complex if the United States makes reciprocal measures, South Korean president Moon Jae-in has announced in a joint press conference with Kim Jong-un.The two leaders also agreed during a three-day summit in Pyongyang to connect two rail lines, on the east and west side of the peninsula, across one of the most militarised borders in the world. Kim also said he would visit Seoul in the “near future”, a move that would make him the first North Korean leader to visit the South’s capital.North and South Korea agreed that the Korean Peninsula should turn into a “land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats”, Moon said. Any transport links would require the approval of the US-led United Nations Command, which oversees the border region.“There is not only going to be a smooth road ahead, there will be challenges and trials, but the more we overcome them the stronger we will become,” Kim said. “We are not afraid of future challenges.”The agreement signed in Pyongyang “will open a higher level for the improvement in relations” between the two Koreas, Kim added, describing it as a “leap forward” toward peace.Donald Trump described the meeting as “Very exciting!” in a tweet, and claimed Kim had “agreed to allow nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations”.Under the agreement signed by the men, North Korea will shut down the Dongchang-ri missile engine testing facility and missile launch pad, according to Moon. It was not immediately clear what North Korea meant by “reciprocal measures” the US could take so that it would shut its nuclear complex, but it is unlikely Washington would agree to give up any part of its own nuclear arsenal.Kim did not mention denuclearisation at any point in his own remarks. The lack of steps specifically on the nuclear issue could worry officials in Washington, and talks between the US and North Korea have stalled in recent weeks. Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy, said: “I think we can expect a two-tiered response where President Trump remains enthusiastic about engaging with Kim Jong-un, but we also see continued scepticism from US officials about both the purported progress on denuclearisation.“But if one thing is clear, it’s that North Korea continues to outmanoeuvre the United States through its willingness to take initiatives that shape the global public narrative and force Washington to choose between engaging on Pyongyang’s terms or looking like it is acting in bad faith.”The two Koreas also agreed to establish a joint military committee to resolve any potential conflicts, and each side will withdrawal 11 guard post from the demilitarised zone by the end of the year. The two militaries agreed to a range of measured to prevent accidental clashes, including a no-fly zone near the border and suspending test firing in the area.South Korea will allow its citizens to visit the Mount Kumgang tourist region in the North for the first time since 2008, when a North Korean soldier shot and killed a tourist from the South. The two sides will also establish a permanent venue for families ided by the 1950-53 Korean war to meet more frequently. In the past most families could see relatives for only a few hours, and usually only once.The two sides also plan to bid to jointly host the 2032 Summer Olympics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a23edd7b152d7f3b58ae062ce11cd60cf76dc392/7_0_2576_1546/master/2576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426770d908604d18c844e473fefeb88d","title":"parallel lives matching portraits from south and north korea in pictures","story":"As South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, visits Pyongyang for the third summit with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, take a look at the photographer Ed Jones’s comparative portraits from the two countriesLee Chi-yoon, an instructor at the Mokdong shooting range in Seoul, on 25 May 2017, and Kim Su-ryon, a staff member at the Maeri shooting range in Pyongyang, on 21 February 2017.Jones said of his photos: “You can put the pictures side by side but the people can’t stand side by side in real life and there’s something inherently captivating about that.”Kim Kun-ho, 25, on his watersports boat on the Han River in Seoul on 19 August 2017, and Kim Il-soo on his tourist boat on the Taedong River in Pyongyang on 25 November 2016.Cpl Woo on the south side of the truce village of Panmunjom, within the Demilitarised Zone, on 2 August 2017, and Lt Kim on the north side of the village on 2 June 2017.Jenni Lim, 21, a student, at a computer lab at Yonsei University, Seoul, on 10 October 2017, and Ri Young-hwa, 19, a volunteer staff member and student, at a computer lab at the Scitech building in Pyongyang on 26 November 2016.Kwon Ye-seul, 30, at the Caribbean Bay waterpark south of Seoul on 6 August 2018, and Ri Song-hui, 21, at the Munsu water park in Pyongyang on 22 September 2017.Yoon Hyerim, 10, after a dance performance at Dongdaemun Design Plaza during Seoul fashion week, on 20 October 2017, and Kim Song-jong, nine, after a dance performance at a Children’s Day event in Pyongyang.Kim Young-hoon, a lifeguard at the One Mount water park in Ilsan, on 30 September 2017, and Choe Un-hwa, a staff member at the Munsu water park in Pyongyang, on 22 September 2017.Lim Jun-beom, 24, a student, in the Sinchon area of Seoul on 5 May 2018, and Pak Kum-ryong, 23, also a student, in a public square in Pyongyang on 22 September 2017Hong Sung-cho, 35, with his son Hong Jinu, two, at a supermarket in Bundang, near Seoul, on 1 September 2018, and Han Gwang-rim, 34, with his daughter Su Ryon at a supermarket in Pyongyang on 4 June 2017.An unidentified pump attendant at a petrol station near Goyang on 15 September 2017, and Kim Su-hyang, 18, at the petrol station where she works on the road between Pyongyang and Nampho on 24 July 2017.Kim Si-eun, 49, at the Spam factory where she works in Jincheon, south of Seoul, on 28 August 2018, and Hong Kum-ju, 27, at the food factory where she works near Wonsan on 11 April 2017.Bang Sung-hee, a tour guide, on the viewing deck of the 63 Building in Seoul on 8 September 2017, and Choi Hee-ok, also a tour guide, on the viewing deck of the Juche Tower in Pyongyang on 28 November 2016.Retired R Adm Park Sae-hun holding a placard during a rally in Seoul demanding the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea, on 12 September 2017, and Ri Kum-hui after a military parade and mass rally on Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang on 15 April 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05b46866ad5d0cc446f63cd18209d70a7b1f94ed/533_953_4853_2912/master/4853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e2a6fb4bb1062d122c00bff0b95ff23","title":"romanians in london brexit immigration photo essay","story":" meets members of the second largest community of British immigrants, who share their concerns ahead of Brexit in an uncertain climateby  Lisa O\u0027Carroll and  Sean SmithRomanians recently overtook the Irish and Indians as the second biggest immigrant community in the UK, but they are among the most vulnerable in the country after Brexit, according to a leading charity advocating for east Europeans in the UK.Many fill vital jobs that keep Britain’s supermarket shelves stocked, the elderly in care homes fed, and hotel rooms clean, but there have been fears that social and economic isolation among those in the low-skills sector would prove a calamitous mix for the many who would wish to remain in the country after Brexit.“The majority of EU citizens are not very well informed about Brexit and the settled status and Romanians are no exception. The language barrier, the fact that most of Romanian citizens don’t follow UK media at all, makes them quite vulnerable,” says Florina Tudose, an outreach worker with the East European Resource Centre, which has repeatedly raised concerns with the Home Office.“From our field research and extensive outreach within the Romanian community, we’ve noticed that many Romanians think that the settled status will be an automatic process, that as long as they pay taxes and are law-abiding citizens, everything is going to be OK,” she says. accompanied Tudose to meet some of the Romanians in communities in two areas of north London and found these fears were borne out.One woman, in her 40s, in a Romanian butcher’s shop explained she had no worries about Brexit.“I lived in Italy for 17 years, I didn’t know if I was illegal, nobody cared, I wasn’t stopped once, why should it be any different here?,” she says.Others wrongly believed the Home Office knew who they were and, as long as they paid taxes, registration would be automatic.“They will send us letters,” one 20-something shop assistant tells Tudose. “I am not worried at all about Brexit, why should I be? I’ve been here nine years and pay taxes and they will see that,” she says, betraying an alarming lack of knowledge about the Home Office plans or the consequences of not registering, which could include deportation or denial of re-entry into the country after a holiday.“Sadly,” says Tudose, “You hear this a lot. How are the Home Office going to get to these people? This is why we are worried.”A closer look at the Romanians interviewed by the  reveal that all have come to Britain to better their lives, not to take benefits.Several parents tell heartbreaking stories about leaving children behind with grandparents, so desperate have they been to provide for their families.Others complained that British people were ignorant about Romania and Romanians, with one protesting: “if Romania is as bad as the British think why has Prince Charles bought so much property there?”“What will England do without us?” says Dragoș, who works in a Romanian restaurant in Dollis Hill, north London, an area popular with Romanians.He was lured to the UK from Germany by a large nursing home group in November 2016.“It wasn’t fair. Last year in November, December, during the bad weather, they all called in to say they couldn’t come in. There was only two centimetres of snow. I had to take my car and personally pick up other Romanians. We couldn’t not go to work. These are elderly people, some have dementia, in my country you are one with the elderly, you have responsibilities and you get that drummed into you. Our work ethic and sense of responsibility is higher than it is here.”Asked what he thinks the British think about Romanians, Dragoș says elliptically. “Every shepherd has its black sheep, so do countries.” He is referring to the “criminals” in his community, who he says give “Romanians a bad name”.He shows me videos of fancy cars and lavish mansions in his town Țăndărei, known as the “Beverley Hills for Romanian gangsters”. It is a narrative that fits well with Brexiters and one that is often heard in the Romanian community, says Tudose.Dragoș, like others, sees himself as a highly mobile worker feeding his family back home where his wife and seven-year-old daughter still live.“We don’t have any future in Romania because of the corruption,” he says.Over the past 20 years Dragoș has lived in Greece, Cyprus, Belgium, Holland, Malta, Italy and Germany. He speaks five languages and thinks Britain would “be in trouble” if it pulled up the drawbridge to EU citizens.“Where will they get the women for all the low-skilled jobs?” If we go home, who is going to do the jobs? It is a bit racist, but it is their own decision. We are all here to work, we pay taxes, to pay rent, we pay insurance, buy food, pay bank fees. There will be a price to pay.”Hannah, who declined to be photographed or named, has been in Britain for two years and she is considering going home as she has only one friend in London.She typifies the type of hard unsung work that is done on a daily basis by EU workers, mainly east European, to keep the shelves full in supermarkets, the rooms clean in hotels and the streets free of rubbish.She worked for 18 months in Aldi in Swindon shifting crates of chilled food.Hannah says: “The job was terrible. It was very hard work, in a warehouse kept at between zero and two degrees. You had to work very hard every day, must pick up 2,000 boxes, boxes of milk, pizza, cooked meats, juice, yoghurt.“I had a target per hour to pick up 300 cases, if you do not make that target you go home.“You were put on trial for three months and if you didn’t make the 300 crates per hour every day you didn’t get a job. I was determined to get the job so I picked up 400 crates an hour, more than I needed.”In her 18 months in the warehouse she says there was just one British worker. “He lasted three days.”She hated the job she says and she was lonely, but she did it for the money, £12 an hour.In a good week she could make close to £500, more than the monthly wage in Romania but the tyranny of poor employment options made it impossible to leave.“It was a good rate, but one day I looked at myself in the safety shoes, gloves and hi-vis jacket and thought: I’m a healthy bright woman I can’t believe I am doing this.” She thought of going into cleaning, but then realised at £7 an hour “it wasn’t much”.Roxy, as she is known, with a masters degree in agricultural engineering under her belt, first came to Britain for adventure. She has been working on the harvests in a berry farm in Kent since 2010. She didn’t intend to stay, but like many EU citizens in Britain, has settled here.She is earning good money compared with what she could make back home, but she’s fed up with the way Romanians are treated, not on the farm, but by the wider community and is unsure of her future here.She says: “I am happy here, I just don’t like it when people say: ‘You are Romanian, you come here just to take our jobs, you are gypsies, you take benefits’.“I have not taken £1 here without working for it. Any English person who comes here and asks for a job at the farm, will get a job with open arms, but they are not coming and still people in this country say we are stealing their jobs.”Was she surprised by the vote to leave the EU?“No,” she says, “because you can see it on people’s faces. They hate us. In the supermarket you see how they look at you when they hear you speak Romanian, it’s better just to shut up. They do not like us.”Roxy says she has not experienced racism and stresses that her employers and all the English people on the farm “treat everyone equally”. The raspberry and soft fruit farm’s owner has frequently expressed fears that he will not be able to recruit staff after Brexit.But she says the perception of Romanians in Britain is otherwise ugly.“British people say they are not racist, but they think we are here as slaves just because we do this work and then they treat us like that. I don’t speak for me or mean the farm, but the general people.”She says fewer Romanians are now coming to Britain as word has got back that it is not all a bed of roses for agricultural workers, despite the lure of good money.Roxy, who is a team leader in the Kent berry farm, says she needs 20 more people to cope with this year’s crop “but they don’t come here” – British or eastern Europeans. “They don’t like the rain, the mud, the hard work”.“If they want to come here to work hard, yes, they should come. But if they want to come here because of some romantic dream, no, it is hard, it is not easy, you’re not in your own country, British people are grumpy and cold towards you.”Roxy arrived in the UK after the principle agricultural recruitment agency Concordia, offered her a job after she graduated with a primary degree in agronomy .At the time a first job in Romania would have earned her £300 a month and with the promise of the same amount a week in England, she made the journey to Kent. It was hard work, but an exciting adventure, she explains.Her day starts at 4am, when she gets up at the house she shares with her boyfriend in Sittingbourne. She is on the farm at 5.45am to lead her team of 40 through aisles and aisles of raspberry plants under polytunnels.Then have a 15-minute tea break at 8.30am and continue to 11am when they have 30 minutes for lunch with a further tea break at 1.30pm. Normally the day ends at 3pm but with so much produce, they continue for another hour during the peak harvest.By the time Roxy gets home at around 6pm she just has time to “shower, cook and eat and then go to bed around 8.30pm to 9.30pm”.Despite the gruelling hours, she appreciates her life in Britain. She says: “I would like to stay here, it’s already our home in a way, but this Brexit, we are not sure we want to make a life here.“Do we want to get a mortgage? We could get one, but next year they could say we can’t stay here, so we have no security.“Sometimes you just want to pack your bags and leave and say: ‘Okay, I’ve had enough’.”It wasn’t easy for Cristina to leave Romania – she needed to make money and had to leave her daughter at home in order to make it work.“It was really hard. I didn’t know anyone here,” she says.“I didn’t know much about Britain. I knew something about the Queen, I knew it was expensive, but that I would earn more money here.“Then when I got here I realised it was not so easy to save.”When asked if the savings are for her daughter, Cristina begins to cry. “It is very hard to be here without her. I need the money for her school. It is a very sensitive subject. It is a big sacrifice.“It is why I am here to pay for my daughter to have private music, to learn foreign languages, she’s also learning taekwondo.“If I wasn’t here she would have none of these things. I am doing this for her. I would like her to come here but because of Brexit I cannot be certain. She is in primary school now. I’m not going to bring her here and then we find out we have to leave,” she says.Life is still hard for Cristina, but better than back home, she believes.She lives in a shared house with six people, each in a room of their own.Living on the outskirts of London costs £600 a month in rent and she hardly ever goes out to socialise or see the sights in the capital as she works from 7am to 7pm six days a week.“I see this as a time in my life I have to make sacrifices,” she says.Moving back to Bucharest wouldn’t make economic sense. She would have to pay £400 a month in rent and would never earn enough money for her daughter and 72-year-old dad, who is on a pension of €200 (£180) a month.“He couldn’t survive without my money,” she says.Does Brexit make her feel unsettled? “It depends on whether I can work any more, but I’m not scared about it.”She hasn’t heard of “settled status” immigration ID, which would be mandatory under current proposals for all EU citizens, bar the Irish, from summer 2021.“Everyone is very confused. I think that’s because of the people in charge,” she suggests.Cristina doesn’t read Romanian or British newspapers or media, where Brexit is headline news every day, because it makes her “anxious”.When Tudose explains what settled status is she says she is willing to apply for it but predicts there is going to be a lot of fraud, people looking to borrow passports and national insurance numbers to get the new identity.Ultimately she hopes to return home, but for now her daughter and father need her wages in London.Sebi, as he is known, has just arrived in London to work in a Romanian butcher’s shop in Burnt Oak. He stands at the counter, while his boss is telling the East European Resource Centre about hate crime that morning when two women shouted at them “to go home” in the lane beside his shop.Sebi, like Cristina, came to Britain to give his child, a 13-year-old-boy, a better life.“I want to secure a future for him, to send him to university.”He is from Botoșani, the poorest part of Romania, and the lack of work prompted him to leave years ago.He has worked on markets selling vegetables all his life, but in Romania he was earning just £8 a day “and that would be on a good day”, Sebi says.He adds: “I lived in a village outside the town with my son and parents and would have to pay for the bus out of that as well as buy utilities, food and clothes.”In London he hopes to earn around £1,200 a month, of which £300 is committed to a single room in a house share, gas and electricity on top of that would still leave him with enough to repatriate, if he does not spend money on going out.He is now on a trial work period at the shop but is full of hope for what he can earn his family. “I am willing to work hard. I want to stay 20 years here until my retirement.”Like Cristina, he tends to stay in the area and has seen none of the treasures of London’s museums and galleries, restaurants and shops, or the capital’s nightlife.“I am afraid to spend money right now,” he says.He hadn’t heard of Brexit and it was a friend who hooked him up with the Burnt Oak job.If he wasn’t in London, he would be somewhere else in Europe earning for his parents and son. He spent a year in Turkey and two years working in a market in Poland.Brexit has changed everything for east Europeans, says Cristina.“When I came to the country, everybody spoke normally to you. There was no big difference if you had papers or not. People just treated you as people and liked immigrants. We worked hard and cleaned properly. British people didn’t know how to clean.“Now, 18 years on and we have all the rights to work, people treat you like an animal,” she says.But she says British people have never tried to understand Romania.“Somebody asked me a few years ago: ‘Did we have TV in Romania?’ I asked them do they own two properties. If Romania is so bad why does Prince Charles love it so much?” she says, quickly doing a Google search on her phone to show his health retreat in the bucolic Transylvania.Cristina says she has not been subjected to racial abuse, but her friends have, particularly those living outside London. “The day after the referendum, they said people said they didn’t want to serve us.”She thinks that many Romanians have returned home because London is now so expensive to rent and because of the uncertainty of Brexit.Christina says: “Now everyone is so scared. People from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, because they do not know what is going to happen.“I tell people it will be okay and they say: ‘No, you need permanent residency, you could be stopped, you could be deported.’”She managed chambermaids for three years in the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch, London, and then in a rubber factory in Doncaster where she was paid £10 an hour.Christina, who is from the city of Târgoviște, came into the country with a sports team in 2001 on a 15-day tourist visa and went on to spend most of her life in the UK in cleaning jobs, working in hotels as well as jobs in coffee chains.“The standard of cleaning by British workers was so bad,” she says in reference to one hotel in Stansted where she worked. “The floor manager was English and she didn’t care about the standard of cleaning.” Romanians care and make people come back to clean properly if rooms are not done right.”Like many Romanians interviewed by the , Cristina left her child behind to come to Britain to make a better life for her son. She was here for two-and-a-half years before he could join her.“It was so hard to leave him. I didn’t want to do it. I had days when I just did my job and I would cry all day,” she says.But she was determined she wanted her son to have something better and after a stint in London went to Barcelona, Spain, and then they went back to Romania in 2009 and opened some food shops.A year later they returned to London to run a restaurant in Dollis Hill with her husband and her two children.She has not heard of the settled status scheme that the Home Office was about to launch, but says London is where she intends to stay while her younger child remains in school.“I don’t have an option. We are going to Romania on holiday, my son says: ‘Mum, when are we going to go home?’”Ovidiu is said to be one of the best known Romanians in the community in Britain, having lived in the country for nearly 40 years. He risked his life to escape the terrors of Romania’s communist dictatorship in 1979.He speaks seven languages, has a thriving bakery business in north London and was once a partner in a chain of pizzerias.But his arrival on a boat from eastern Europe was pure fluke.His wife had died in an accident leaving him with five small children, the youngest just six months old, to bring up on his own. After six years as a widow, and with the Ceaușescu regime in its first flushes of dictatorship, he decided his best chance was to leave the country be secreting himself on a ship heading to Freiberg in Germany, where he had some friends.“The truth is 1979-1980 were really hard,” he says.While on board, the ship was rechartered and he ended up in Turkey and then – by chance – in Kent, having lost half his body weight as a stowaway.“It was a huge risk. We had political prisons. You could have been sentenced to 15 years in a labour camp or disappeared.”He went straight to Amnesty and after three weeks he got a job in the Basel St Hotel behind Harrods in London, giving him a start in the hospitality trade that was to last decades.As for Brexit, he says: “I don’t know if the government is prepared. Romanians work everywhere, in hospitals, coffee shops, garbage, they work in Asda, Iceland, some are in good positions, working in management, in homes for the elderly. The English aren’t going to take those jobs. They won’t do the shit jobs.”“I think Brexit is done to get rid of all the people on benefits,” he adds, and goes on to complains about fellow Romanians who come to the UK to take advantage – as he sees it – of the British system. “I have five children and am a single parent but I did not take any benefit for all that time. People can be entitled to benefits but the English government doesn’t check.”Theology postgraduate Cătălin has been in the UK on and off since 2006, initially on a seasonal agriculture workers’ scheme which allowed temporary immigration from Bulgaria and Romania ahead of full accession to the EU.He and his wife are now British citizens and will be here at least until they retire.Cătălin believes the UK seasonal work is less attractive, largely because the pound is so weak. In 2006 the pound would buy €1.46. Now it will buy just €1.12 and the price of accommodation and food has gone up.But the big appeal for Cătălin was a career. He progressed from picker, to supervisor, to team leader to line manager and is now a farm manager, running a £7m turnover section of the berry fields where he manages a team of 260 people.He is from a middle-class family who could afford to send their son to university, but Cătălin says such a career trajectory would not have existed at home. “Here I could build a career on my own steam. In Romania you need to know someone to help you. You would never have become a farm manager in 12 years,” he says.From the beginning the money was relatively attractive with wages of £350-£380 a week on the fruit farm in Herefordshire compared with the £200 a month on offer in Romania.“With the money I was able to buy land in Romania, plant cherry trees, renovate my father’s house, buy new furniture and put in central heating,” he says.“When I think of Britain then, the prices of food and fuel were lower, you could buy a lot more and save a lot more.

Not a trifling figure. “I was quite stressed about it, I took it very seriously,” he says. “It was a lot of money. I paid taxes for 12 years and just to secure my future I had to pay that.”He works hard but he likes his life in a quite village in the West Country. “It’s clean, there are plenty of green areas and parks and we have friends in towns around here.”Many Romanians are returning: Cătălin has a friend who runs a haulage company which cannot hire drivers and the economy back home is getting stronger.

A groundswell of support for a Communist party challenger had followed plans to raise the pension age by five years for both men and women, delaying retirement for millions.The extraordinary call to annul the result shows the degree to which the Kremlin, which is sensitive to public opinion and the possibility for protest, must balance supporting its political allies and assuaging public anger. While Russians still largely say they support Putin, close to half say they are also willing to protest against the loss of social benefits.Under pressure to review the vote, Russia’s elections commissioner, Ella Pamfilova, said on Wednesday that violations at a number of polling stations by both sides meant that a rerun should be held. The final decision rests with local election officials, who will meet on Thursday.If the results are thrown out and the election held again, it would mark the first decision of its kind in more than 15 years.Pamfilova, a former human rights ombudsman, was installed by the Kremlin in 2016 to increase trust. More than 100,000 Russians came out to protest in Moscow in 2011 over the results from parliamentary elections marred by accusations of voter fraud.Tarasenko said on Wednesday he would not run in new elections. Communist officials have said they would prefer the elections be recounted, rather than held again.New elections may be held in three months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7f68217758f39874686cd7f571ae1cd312db421/0_60_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad709bf1100cc016db1f8b54207fe7f7","title":"uk plans for trade and irish border need to be reworked says tusk","story":"European council president indicates that no-deal remains possibility if no resolution to Brexit talks is foundDonald Tusk has said that Theresa May’s Chequers proposals for dealing with the Irish border and future trade relations after Brexit will need to be “reworked and further negotiated” in a sign of how far the UK and EU are from resolving the most fraught issues in the orce talks.Opening the EU summit in Salzburg, Tusk, the European council president, said the Brexit talks were entering a decisive phase and that “various scenarios” were still possible – a clear hint that no-deal remained a possibility if no acceptable resolution to the negotiations could be reached.Tusk said that some of May’s Chequers proposals “indicated positive evolution” and highlighted the “among other things, the readiness to cooperate on security and foreign policy”.But in a blow to the British prime minister the EU leader said that was not the case “on other issues, such as the Irish question, or the framework for economic co-operation, where the UK proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated”.Tusk confirmed there would be a special European summit in November, which is intended to be when Brexit negotiations end, and tried to add a note of urgency in conclusion, saying: “There is more hope but there is surely less and less time, every day left we must use for talks.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Man in his 20s dies after being hit by a tree as severe winds batter IrelandSecond day of event cancelled after public display area suffers damage from strong windsSoldiers have had to \u0026lsquofight Government tooth and nail\u0026rsquo over pay, conditions, D\u0026aacuteil toldSoutheast health system like something in a third-world country \u0026ndash sister of farmer who died in ambulance en route to CorkMan sacked after camera turned off while colleague allegedly assaulted drug addictN\u0026oacuteir\u0026iacuten O\u0026rsquoSullivan seeks order to extend time legally allowed to bring defamation caseIrish Raptor Study Group seeking High Court order quashing decision to grant permissionPlanes, trains and trams all cancelled due to high windsFinal count was almost certainly just under 152,000, after pedestrians and those bussed to the venue were countedStorm force 11 winds batter Ireland amid orange alert\u0026lsquoNobody in their right mind would ever live in that house\u0026rsquo, says boys\u0026rsquo mother, who campaigned for house\u0026rsquos demolitionOireachtas health committee is told start date for GP-led structure from early next year is \u0026lsquochallenging\u0026rsquoWednesday marks \u0026lsquoEuropean day without a road death\u0026rsquoOpening of day two of National Ploughing Championships put back as a safety measureCommission calls for creation of national centre for intelligence collation and analysisCollege Gate apartments on Townsend Street face acquisition under Link proposalsCommittee asked to examine claims Michael D Higgins stayed in \u0026euro3,000-a-night hotelCollege Gate housing complex threatened by Link development"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3634421.1537365351!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"opw reveals final headcount for papal mass in phoenix park","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Making their way to the Mass, celebrated by Pope Francis in the Phoenix Park, Dublin in August.  Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The The mystery of how many people attended the papal Mass in the Phoenix Park in August finally appears to have been solved.The Office of Public Works revealed yesterday that the final count was almost certainly just under 152,000, after pedestrians and those bussed to the venue were counted.The OPW released official count figures following an FOI request and said the number of pedestrians to enter the park on the day was 131,875.In addition to that, an estimated further 20,000 people travelled to the event by bus and were not officially subject to a headcount.On the day of the final Mass , the OPW had in place counting systems for health and safety reasons.“This data was critical for the egress after Mass as each gate had a flow capacity, and all had to be out of the park before sunset,” it said.The OPW said the 131,875 figure\u0026nbspincluded only those who entered the site through monitored gates by foot.An information note explained: “In addition to those on foot, there were several thousand of attendees who entered the site by vehicle access through the unmonitored gates such as invited guests who were coached in, the choir, those involved in the Mass, and those availing of universal access.”The OPW said their best estimate of how many came in this way was “in the order of 20,000”.They said the maximum capacity for the event had ended up being 485,000 tickets, all of which were supposed to have been taken.The office explained: “When the ticket allocation was complete, the World Meeting of Families collated all of the information in conjunction with their ticking company, and gave an oral presentation, confirming that they had reached all their ticket targets.”In the immediate aftermath of the visit, neither gardaí­ nor the OPW said they were in a position to confirm exactly how many people had actually attended.However, they did confirm that attendance was lower than expected, which had made managing the event much easier than anticipated.On social media, some claimed that the crowd had barely topped 100,000 while commentators supportive of the Catholic Church said it was likely to have been in excess of 200,000.The turnout paled in comparison with the numbers that attended the Mass said by Pope John Paul II in 1979, when an estimated one million people turned up.The poor attendance for the event was blamed on a variety of factors, including poor weather on the day and also the distance that people would have to walk to get there.Separately, warnings for those suffering from health problems as well as reports about the spread of contagious diseases may have put off others.In addition, an unknown number of tickets were block-booked by protesters who took large numbers of tickets without having any intention of attending.One man, part of the “Say Nope to the Pope” Facebook page, claimed to have got 800 tickets in this manner, including booking several tickets in the name of “Jesus Christ”.Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

Photograph: Olivier HosletEPAEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has rebuffed British calls for the European Union to change its stance on the contested issue of the Irish Border, and said a “moment of truth” was fast approaching on a Brexit deal.Mr Barnier said the bloc was ready “to improve” its proposal on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, but stopped short of accepting British ideas for compromise, after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, called on the EU to show flexibility.“The European Council in October will be the moment of truth, it is the moment when we shall see if we have an agreement,” Mr Barnier said.The Irish Border has emerged as the biggest stumbling block to the Brexit deal that British prime minister Theresa May hopes to strike with the EU this autumn. While the EU and UK have agreed there should be no hard border to prevent any return to violence, they are deadlocked over how to manage what will become a 499km (310-mile) frontier between the UK and EU.Both sides have proposed fallback plans, known as backstops, that would kick into place if trade talks fail to settle the question. The EU’s involves Northern Ireland following EU law on customs and goods, a plan Ms May has said no British prime minister could ever accept.Mr Barnier said the EU was working to improve its proposal, adding that the problem had been caused by “the UK’s decision to leave the EU, its single market and the customs union”. Seeking to counter British criticism that the EU plan eroded UK sovereignty, he said: “What we talking about here is not a land border, not a sea border, it is a set of technical checks and controls. We respect the territorial integrity of the UK and we respect the conditional order of the UK.”Mr Barnier was speaking after a 90-minute meeting with the EU’s 27 European affairs ministers at a summit in Brussels. Many countries intervened in the debate to stress the importance of reaching a deal and its timing.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney got a full update from Mr Barnier on the backstop developments and later described his meeting as “excellent”. The Cabinet earlier agreed to hire 451 new staff for border duties out of a total of 1,077 needed for ports and airports.The Republic is among several EU countries concerned that having an emergency summit in November will take the pressure off the British in the coming weeks.Ms May will appeal to EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg to soften their stance over UK access to the single market and customs union. She is expected to tell them on Wednesday night that Brussels needs to shift. A senior Number 10 official said: “To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.”Downing Street believes that the UK has developed its negotiating position to reach the Chequers plan and it is now time for other EU countries to show some flexibility in order to finally strike a deal. The prime minister will argue that with “goodwill and determination” the UK and the EU could avoid a “disorderly” Brexit that would be damaging for both sides and instead strike a deal that benefited both.“Neither side can demand the ‘unacceptable’ of the other, such as an external customs border between different parts of the United Kingdom. No other country would accept it if they were in the same situation,” she will say.Ms May will tell her fellow leaders that the EU’s current proposal does not respect the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK as it effectively suggests a customs border down the Irish sea with its backstop plan.She is expected to deny suggestions by EU officials that the UK is attempting to cherry-pick by seeking the rights of membership without the obligations.“That is not what we are doing,” she will say. “What we are proposing is a fair arrangement that will work for the EU’s economy as well as the UK’s, without undermining the single market.”Number 10 has been cautiously optimistic in recent days that the UK can expect a softening of tone at the Salzburg summit from some EU leaders who are keen to nail down a Brexit deal this autumn.It remains to be seen whether that translates into a shift in negotiating position from Brussels, where officials have been more sceptical. The EU27 will wait to discuss next steps, including whether to relax Mr Barnier’s negotiating mandate, until Ms May has left the room.– ServiceDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The centuries-long hunt for the remains of the famed ship could be nearing an end. Photograph:  Saeed KhanAFPGetty ImagesThe Endeavour set off from England in 1768 and traversed a world that sailors’ maps had yet to document. The ship bounded through the Pacific Ocean, scraping up against the Great Barrier Reef and stopping in New Zealand and Tahiti. The journey also charted parts of Australia, leading its captain, James Cook, to become regarded as a central figure in the nation’s origin story.A decade later, the vessel sank after having been sold, renamed (as the Lord Sandwich 2) and scuttled, apparently left to anonymously join about a dozen other ships in a mass grave of wreckage off the coast of Rhode Island.But marine archaeologists said this week that after a search that ned decades, the remains of the Endeavour, however decrepit, may have been located.The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project said that on Friday it would detail the results of its study of what lies at the bottom of Newport Harbour, and it is expected to announce that it has narrowed down the wreckage that belongs to the storied ship.“We can say we think we know which one it is,” Kathy Abbass, the archaeology project’s director, told Fairfax Media. The discovery has stirred hope that the remains could be excavated in time for the planned celebrations in 2020 of the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook’s arrival in Australia.But it has also touched on the challenging history associated with exploration, which connected Europe with the rest of the world but also cleared the way to the oppression and devastation of indigenous populations.For some 25 years, marine archaeologists have sought to pinpoint the Endeavour’s wreckage from a collection of remains from 13 ships. In 2016, the researchers homed in on a group of five ships that they believed included the Endeavour. Now, researchers say they will release a three-dimensional image of a “promising site”, located off tiny Goat Island in Narragansett Bay in Newport.The scientists have cautioned that time took a considerable toll on the remains. Cook’s three-year expedition on the Endeavour was a mission to gather astronomical and geographical data for the British Navy. It ended up telegraphing the cultures and surprising wildlife of far-off places back to Britain.An artist on board ended up producing more than 900 images from the trip, including what was believed to be the first drawing of a kangaroo by a European, as well as depictions of Maori warriors in New Zealand.The journey was harrowing at times. One night, while sailing along Australia’s eastern coast, the ship swiped the jagged coral of the Great Barrier Reef, leaving a gaping hole. The ship’s load had to be lightened to keep it afloat. Cook ordered that a half-dozen cannons be dumped overboard.Scientific expeditions and search parties tried to find those cast-iron cannons for two centuries before researchers from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, armed with a magnetometer, reported discovering them in “good condition” in 1969.Like Columbus, Cook left a deep impression on the lands he explored, with towns, islands, mountains, rivers and a university named for him. (There is even a Cook Crater on the moon, even though, of course, his expeditions never took him there.)But also like Columbus, his legacy has been the subject of reappraisal and controversy. Statues of him have been vandalised, and some activists contend that his exploration factored into the dispossession of Indigenous Australians. Disagreements over Cook’s legacy were revived over plans to spend nearly $50 million on celebrations tied to the anniversary of his arrival in Botany Bay, in Sydney, in 1770.The captain sailed on the Endeavour for the first of his three voyages around the world. He was killed in Hawaii on his final voyage in 1779. The Endeavour – or by this point, the Lord Sandwich 2 – made its way to North America, where the British used it to carry troops and prisoners during the American Revolutionary War.In 1778, it was intentionally sunk to block French ships coming to aid the Americans in their rebellion. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/19/TELEMMGLPICT000175068023_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"behind shutter james oatway photographing south africas red","story":"A Red Ants major carries out two small children during the eviction of residents of a so-called hijacked building in Bree Street, JohannesburgBehind the ShutterThis dramatic image shows a man​ carrying two small children by their arms during an eviction operation in Bree Street, Johannesburg. ​The man is a ​major in the Red Ants​,​​ a private eviction and security firm based in South Africa\u0027s biggest city​ recognisable by their trademark red overalls and helmets​.On arrival the Red Ants gave residents an opportunity to grab what they could and leave the building.Sikhumbuzo Dlamini, a major in the Red Ants, picked up these two shellshocked children and moved them away from the entrance.

The RTE broadcaster said the victim was sleeping at the time when strong winds lifted the caravan from the ground.On Wednesday afternoon, police confirmed the death of a man in his 20s, who was hit by a tree as he worked in a country park in Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, travel disruption, power cuts and flying debris posing a threat to life are possible as the storm sweeps through, with severe gales of up to 75mph and heavy rain forecast for a large part of the UK.There is also potential for damage to buildings, fallen trees, travel cancellations, road closures and large waves in coastal areas.As Ali rolled in on Wednesday morning the Met Office updated its amber weather warning of wind, saying there is now a high likelihood of impacts across a swathe of the country.An amber warning covering Northern Ireland, northern parts of England and southern Scotland has prompted the Met Office to issue advice for the public to beware of flying debris, which could pose a danger to life.A man has died and another was injured when a tree fell on them as they worked in a country park in Northern Ireland during Storm Ali.It is understood the men were doing contract work for Northern Ireland Water when the incident happened in Slieve Gullion Park, near Newry, Co Down, on Wednesday afternoon.The man who died was aged in his 20s. The injured man, who is aged in his 40s, had been taken to hospital.A spokeswoman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: Police attended the sudden death of a man, aged in his 20s, in the Slieve Gullion Park, Drumintee Road area of Newry this afternoon.Police said there were no suspicious circumstances and the incident was being investigated by the region\u0027s Health and Safety Executive.Irish police confirmed a woman died after a caravan was blown off a cliff in the west of Ireland.A Garda statement said: Gardai at Clifden Co Galway are investigating an incident which occurred at Claddaghduff, Co Galway this morning.At approximately 7.45am a report was received that a caravan had blown off the cliff at the above location.A search was carried out at the scene on the beach and after a short time the body of a female in her 50s was recovered.Her body is expected to be removed to University College Galway (UCG) for a post-mortem examination. The local coroner has been notified.A fallen tree in Dublin as strong winds batter the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and parts of EnglandGale-force winds from Storm Ali with gusts of over 140 kilometres per hour have caused damage to the electricity network affecting more than 140,000 homes, farms and businesses, Ireland\u0027s electricity supplier said.The damage is mainly attributable to fallen trees on overhead lines as a result of the high winds. A car damaged by a fallen tree in Dublin on Wednesday morningIrish President Michael D Higgins expressed his condolences to the family of the woman who died in Co Galway.Today\u0027s strong winds can result in dangerous situations and I would urge everyone to heed the warnings by the authorities and take caution when travelling or when out in the open, he said.I was deeply saddened to learn that Storm Ali has already claimed one victim today in Claddaghduff, Co Galway. As President of Ireland, may I express my deepest condolences to her family.I would also take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those, in statutory and voluntary organisations around the country, who are helping and stand ready to assist their fellow citizens, and who are working to maintain essential services around the country.A major incident has been declared in parts of Scotland as high winds and rain continue to batter the north of the UK. The Dumfries and Galloway Virtual Operations Support Team made the warning there was a major risk to life. In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, the group said it was not allowing children to walk home from school at the end of the day. Also in Scotland, a  cruise ship has become detached from its moorings in strong winds at the port of Greenock, Inverclyde.A statement from Oceania Cruises said: This afternoon, while alongside at the port of Greenock, Scotland, Nautica encountered extremely strong winds which resulted in the parting of mooring lines and the vessel being detached from the dock.All guests and crew onboard are safe and there were no injuries. Tugs have been called in to assist and the vessel is currently being held off of her berth. 478 guests and 26 crew are ashore and are being looked after by the shore operations teams until conditions are safe enough for the vessel to be returned to the passenger terminal.Winds of more than 90mph have been recorded near Dundee, according to bridge operators.The Tay Road Bridge said 91.7mph gales had hit the structure on Wednesday, which was forced to close to all traffic.A section of Princes Street in Edinburgh has been closed after parts of a shop roof flew off in strong winds.Police Scotland was alerted to lead falling from the Topshop building at around 12.30pm on Wednesday.A cordon has been put in place on the eastern part of the street.Meanwhile, South Bridge Street has been shut between Chambers Street and the High Street after lead fell from the Tron Kirk at around 12.10pm. There have been no injuries in either incident.Northern England is also taking a battering form Storm Ali, with traffic disruption, power cuts and fallen trees blocking roads from Merseyside to Cumbria.The Met Office put in place a number of Amber and Yellow warnings for Cumbria, warning people to secure garden furniture, be aware of flying debris and take extra care on the roads.Highways England has also issued a severe weather alert for north-west and north-east England.A fallen tree blocked a major junction in the Aintree area of Liverpool, with motorists advised to avoid the area.The A66 in Cumbria has been closed in both directions between the M6 and A1M due to high winds, and the A628 Woodhead Pass between Manchester and Sheffield has been closed to high sided vehicles.The M6 was also closed northbound between junctions 43 and 44 after an HGV was blown over. Police warned the road may be closed for some time and asked the public to drive only if absolutely necessary.Six areas of Carlisle have also suffered a power cut with Electricity North West engineers working to restore supply.Superintendent Mark Pannone of Cumbria Police said: We are getting a high number of calls about disruption, with trees down on some roads.We would urge people to be aware of their surroundings and take care.We would ask drivers to leave themselves plenty of time for travelling and to monitor local radio and websites for any travel information.Our advice to drivers is to slow down and to drive to the conditions you face.The amber warning is in force until 6pm, while a further yellow warning of winds up to 60mph covers the rest of Scotland, Yorkshire and northern parts of Wales.Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: Storm Ali is already bringing some pretty heavy rain across Northern Ireland and south-west Scotland and is just starting to creep into north-west England.In terms of wind strength, the speeds are coming up, with a gusts of just over 60mph in the west of Ireland.Around eight, nine and ten o\u0027clock winds will really start ramping up and go further still.The worst of Ali\u0027s weather is forecast to be in the north, although areas outside the official weather warnings are unlikely to escape wet and windy conditions.While southern parts of England and Wales could reach continued unseasonable highs of up to 24C (75F), it will feel cooler due to the strong winds, Mr Wilson said.The unsettled weather is due to last through the week, but an improvement is expected early next week as drier weather is set to take hold.Ali is first on the storm names list for 2018-19 announced by the Met Office and Met Eireann, which has run the Name Our Storms scheme for four years.The season\u0027s names have been compiled from a list of submissions by the public, choosing some of the most popular names and also selecting those which reflect the nations, culture and ersity of the UK and Ireland.Please review our commenting policyAmerican surgeon and girlfriend suspected of multiple drug rapesViolence to be treated as a disease in London, mayor announces Comment: Why seven is the most magical age of allUS launches first biodefence strategy in wake of new infectious disease threatsPolice officers to be given course on \u0026#39banter\u0026#39 so they don\u0026#39t make offensive jokesMore than five million children in Yemen risk starving to death as food and fuel prices soar Comment: Grand Olympic gestures are no substitute for progress on North Korean nukesFrench Closer magazine loses appeal over topless photos of Duchess of CambridgeKhalid Masood told his children he was \u0026#39going to die fighting for God\u0026#39 weeks before Westminster attackIndia makes Islamic \u0026#39triple-talaq\u0026#39 instant orce punishable by up to three years in prisonBritain set for most beautiful autumn in years, predicts RHSCricklewood mosque \u0026#39hate crime\u0026#39 crash: Three hurt as car hits crowd after \u0026#39tirade of racist abuse\u0026#39Pakistan court orders release of former prime minister Sharif and daughter Comment: Britain needs more homes, and failure is not an optionComment: At last, a Tory who gets it: My parents weren\u0026#39t hypocrites for living on a council estateRoyal wedding number 3 as Lady Gabriella Windsor announces engagementComment: Is the EU really ready to do a Brexit deal?

The RTE broadcaster said the victim was sleeping at the time when strong winds lifted the caravan from the ground.On Wednesday afternoon, police confirmed the death of a man in his 20s, who was hit by a tree as he worked in a country park in Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, travel disruption, power cuts and flying debris posing a threat to life are possible as the storm sweeps through, with severe gales of up to 75mph and heavy rain forecast for a large part of the UK.There is also potential for damage to buildings, fallen trees, travel cancellations, road closures and large waves in coastal areas.As Ali rolled in on Wednesday morning the Met Office updated its amber weather warning of wind, saying there is now a high likelihood of impacts across a swathe of the country.An amber warning covering Northern Ireland, northern parts of England and southern Scotland has prompted the Met Office to issue advice for the public to beware of flying debris, which could pose a danger to life.A man has died and another was injured when a tree fell on them as they worked in a country park in Northern Ireland during Storm Ali.It is understood the men were doing contract work for Northern Ireland Water when the incident happened in Slieve Gullion Park, near Newry, Co Down, on Wednesday afternoon.The man who died was aged in his 20s. The injured man, who is aged in his 40s, had been taken to hospital.A spokeswoman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: Police attended the sudden death of a man, aged in his 20s, in the Slieve Gullion Park, Drumintee Road area of Newry this afternoon.Police said there were no suspicious circumstances and the incident was being investigated by the region\u0027s Health and Safety Executive.Irish police confirmed a woman died after a caravan was blown off a cliff in the west of Ireland.A Garda statement said: Gardai at Clifden Co Galway are investigating an incident which occurred at Claddaghduff, Co Galway this morning.At approximately 7.45am a report was received that a caravan had blown off the cliff at the above location.A search was carried out at the scene on the beach and after a short time the body of a female in her 50s was recovered.Her body is expected to be removed to University College Galway (UCG) for a post-mortem examination. The local coroner has been notified.A fallen tree in Dublin as strong winds batter the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and parts of EnglandGale-force winds from Storm Ali with gusts of over 140 kilometres per hour have caused damage to the electricity network affecting more than 140,000 homes, farms and businesses, Ireland\u0027s electricity supplier said.The damage is mainly attributable to fallen trees on overhead lines as a result of the high winds. A car damaged by a fallen tree in Dublin on Wednesday morningIrish President Michael D Higgins expressed his condolences to the family of the woman who died in Co Galway.Today\u0027s strong winds can result in dangerous situations and I would urge everyone to heed the warnings by the authorities and take caution when travelling or when out in the open, he said.I was deeply saddened to learn that Storm Ali has already claimed one victim today in Claddaghduff, Co Galway. As President of Ireland, may I express my deepest condolences to her family.I would also take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those, in statutory and voluntary organisations around the country, who are helping and stand ready to assist their fellow citizens, and who are working to maintain essential services around the country.A major incident has been declared in parts of Scotland as high winds and rain continue to batter the north of the UK. The Dumfries and Galloway Virtual Operations Support Team made the warning there was a major risk to life. In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, the group said it was not allowing children to walk home from school at the end of the day. Also in Scotland, a  cruise ship has become detached from its moorings in strong winds at the port of Greenock, Inverclyde.A statement from Oceania Cruises said: This afternoon, while alongside at the port of Greenock, Scotland, Nautica encountered extremely strong winds which resulted in the parting of mooring lines and the vessel being detached from the dock.All guests and crew onboard are safe and there were no injuries. Tugs have been called in to assist and the vessel is currently being held off of her berth. 478 guests and 26 crew are ashore and are being looked after by the shore operations teams until conditions are safe enough for the vessel to be returned to the passenger terminal.Winds of more than 90mph have been recorded near Dundee, according to bridge operators.The Tay Road Bridge said 91.7mph gales had hit the structure on Wednesday, which was forced to close to all traffic.A section of Princes Street in Edinburgh has been closed after parts of a shop roof flew off in strong winds.Police Scotland was alerted to lead falling from the Topshop building at around 12.30pm on Wednesday.A cordon has been put in place on the eastern part of the street.Meanwhile, South Bridge Street has been shut between Chambers Street and the High Street after lead fell from the Tron Kirk at around 12.10pm.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”.

Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.In fact, the same chemical pathways help regulate a range of other cell functions in the body, including hair growth.The researchers focused on a receptor called OR2AT4, which is known to be stimulated by Sandalore, and which can be found in the outer layer of hair follicles.Intriguingly, the results suggest that human hair follicles can “smell”, in the sense that they make use of ancient smell receptors to control key functions such as growth.With millions of men and women in the UK affected by hair loss, demand for a “baldness cure” is high. Despite some promising studies over the years, many do not make it beyond the confines of the research lab.According to Professor Paus, however, his latest discovery is “not far at all” from being applied in a clinical context for hair loss.“Sandalore is already offered as a cosmetic product in Italy by the company that has co-sponsored the current study,” he said.Now, the researchers have a larger scale, professionally-controlled clinical trial underway, and they expect to see results by the beginning of next year.Dr Nicola Clayton of the British Association of Dermatologists, who was not involved in the study, said: “It is a fascinating concept that the human hair follicle, as the authors put it, can “smell” by utilising an olfactory receptor.”She said the group’s data was “very exciting”, although noted that from clinical perspective she could only speculate about the extent to which such a treatment would improve outcomes for patients.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/12/42968214430-2cd1fa30e2-k.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1365  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/12/42968214430-2cd1fa30e2-k.jpg","title":"jacks tesco discount low price british products locations dave lewis share price","story":"Created with Sketch.New chain will create up to 375 new jobs and will be cheaper to run, allowing it to offer lower prices, chief executive Dave Lewis said Click to followThe IndependentTesco CEO Dave Lewis at the launch of new discount chain Jack\u0027sTesco’s new discount chain Jack’s will be ‘cheapest in town’ and focus on ‘Britishness’Tesco has launched its new discount brand, Jack’s, as it fights to regain market share from the likes of Aldi and Lidl, with two stores set to open on Thursday and up to 15 planned for next year. The new chain\u0026nbsphas been the subject of weeks of speculation. It\u0026nbspis the result of more than two years of planning, working with over 350 supplier partners, and at a launch in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, on Wednesday, the focus was on the “Britishness” of the brand and lower prices. Jack’s will be the “cheapest in town”, according to the supermarket’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, through a combination of deals agreed with suppliers and lower operating costs at its pared back stores. “It’s very simple to run, it allows us to lower prices,” he said. Supply costs will be reduced due to changes to packaging, but no products will be supplied to Jack’s at a lower value than they are sold to Tesco, Mr Lewis said.The new stores will also offer a much smaller range of products than a traditional Tesco branch, with around 2,600 against the tens of thousands on sale in Tesco. Of the 2,600 product lines, 1,800 will be Jack’s own-brand. Meanwhile, eight out of ten products at Jack’s will be made, grown or reared in Britain, and most of the packaging reflects this, with Union Jacks adorning several items. This focus on Britishness has “nothing at all” to do with Brexit, Mr Lewis said, but reflects customers’ preference for locally sourced food and drink.Jack’s will be targeting “price sensitive customers”, and will\u0026nbspopen accordingly in areas with poorer populations.The Chatteris store has been created at a site previously earmarked for a new Tesco, which was mothballed four years ago, and the Immingham, Lincolnshire branch, which also opens on Thursday, uses a similar space. Of the 10 to 15 Jack’s shops planned for next year, five of them will be repurposed Tesco properties, some of which will be mothballed sites, but most of which will be current Tesco  stores.Tesco expected to launch new discount storesJamie Oliver is the new face of TescoCan Tesco\u0027s discounter Jack\u0027s succeed where others have failed? In terms of competing, Mr Lewis said he is not concerned about the risk of losing custom from Tesco to Jack’s: “I’d rather cannibalise myself than have somebody else cannibalise me.”As if to prove this belief, the company will open at least one Jack’s “right beside a Tesco”.In terms of competing with Aldi and Lidl, which are rapidly eating up market share in the highly competitive supermarket space, Jack’s will offer the lowest prices within the local area around each store, rather than competing on a national level. The new brand will not offer any online element, aside from an in-store app which will allow customers to scan products as they shop.The group said no jobs will be lost through the creation of Jack’s, although some staff took voluntary redundancy rather than staying on as Jack’s employees or moving to another Tesco site.The company said between 20 and 25 jobs will be created per new Jack’s store, meaning the total number of new roles created could reach 375.\u0026nbspHowever, the lower price offering will also mean lower wages for staff, Mr Lewis said, “because working conditions will be different”. Employees will be offered a base rate of pay, rather than the usual benefits package Tesco staff get. The Jack’s brand is being launched as part of the group’s centenary celebrations, and has been named in honour of Tesco founder Jack Cohen.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/12/16/sleep-pods.jpg","title":"sleep napping sleeponomics korea sleepology science nap pods sleeping","story":"Created with Sketch.Our technologically-fuelled\u0026nbsplives\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspexhausting us, but they are also\u0026nbspdriving the market of sleep. Jessica Brown investigates whether the commodification of sleep is just a fad, or if the booming industry really can help us get some shut-eyeClick to followThe IndependentPodtime has sold nearly 500 nap pods in 19 countries since launching eight years agoIn these wellness-obsessed times, the tried-and-tested basics of fruit, vegetables, sleep and exercise just aren’t enough anymore.From the moment we wake up and scroll through social media, we’re inundated with ads tempting us with lotions, drinks and devices that promise to make us mentally and physically healthier, many of which have questionable claims. (Detox juices and appetite-suppressing lollipops, I’m looking at you.) \u0026nbspThe latest commodity we’re being persuaded to invest in\u0026nbspis products to help us sleep, fuelled by a booming “sleeponomics”\u0026nbspindustry in a sleep-deprived South Korea. But while it may seem like we’re getting a lot less shut-eye than we used to in the UK, according to most research we’re not getting any less now than we have done in recent history. \u0026nbspIt might feel that way, since we’re\u0026nbspall a lot more anxious and stressed these days, tuned into the blue light of our devices until late at night, and in increasingly demanding jobs where we feel obliged to answer emails 247.Work has a huge role to play in how little sleep we’re getting lines are becoming blurrier between work and home, we’re travelling more and commuting further, and working more overtime –\u0026nbspthe nine\u0026nbspto five\u0026nbspjob feels like a thing of the past.But while technology and work are making us tired, they’re also driving the market for sleep. No longer will a good mattress and some chamomile tea suffice when we can cuddle up to sleep robots, use devices to measure our sleep, assess the lighting and temperature of our bedrooms, and adjust the firmness of our beds – all through an app. \u0026nbspMattresses aren’t just mattresses anymore –\u0026nbspthey’re a lifestyle, and sleep is an industry, targeting everyone from the mildly tired to the insomniacs. London’s even hosting the capital’s only sleep exhibition next month, with consultations and talks dedicated to the art of sleeping well.While some may argue it’s good to have a market for all our sleep ailments, an industry steeped in promises leaves potential for disappointment. And for an industry so lacking regulation, this potential is high. \u0026nbspDreem, a headband that promises to make you go to sleep faster, for example, states on its website it has conducted “internal research”, however, this research doesn’t seem to be published anywhere, and there’s a very slim chance that it’s peer-reviewed.As one research paper published by US-based scientists points out, the most popular consumer sleep technologies, sleep tracking apps worn on the wrist as you sleep and alarm clocks such as Sleep Cycle, may actually cause sleep disruption from noise and light pollution. “Many sleep tracking apps require user activation and device placement on the mattress to monitor sleep,” the paper states. \u0026nbspJournalist Caroline Christie describes herself as a terrible sleeper, and says she stopped using a sleep app after it started making her anxious and reminding her when she was sleep deprived. “It also made me quite competitive, wanting to make sure I kept getting the right numbers of hours,” she says. “I’ve come to accept it all comes down to routine, and doing what it takes to make you feel relaxed and able to switch off.” \u0026nbspThere’s no such thing as sleep qualification in academia. I’m talking to public health charities and bodies who give qualifications to do something about itAnother concern, the paper states, is the lack of validation studies, FDA approval, and endorsement from American Academy of Sleep Medicine-accredited sleep facilities or sleep specialists. “Practically speaking, lack of validation may be premeditated by some developers, who run the risk of their technology being debunked or labelled inferior if compared to clinical standards,” it states. \u0026nbspAnd in terms of their reliability of measuring sleep or diagnosing sleep disorders, a wrist device hardly compares to the standards of a clinical sleep evaluation\u0026nbspa process which can involve being constantly monitored by technologists, who use\u0026nbspan electrocardiogram\u0026nbspwith more than 20 sensors to record breathing, brain and heart activity over a full night.Christie says, however, that she invested in some products recently to help her sleep\u0026nbspand drown out the sounds of her flatmates –\u0026nbspand they seem to be helping. “About six months ago, I invested in a Bluetooth eye mask that helps me block out surrounding noise and light. Now, it’s part of my sleep routine and helps my body realise it’s time to sleep. It’s comforting, easy to use, and helps me disconnect and drift off.” \u0026nbspShutterstock)However, sleep expert James Wilson, who advises workplaces, sports teams and families on their sleep, describes the market for sleep as “quite superficial,” and the lack of research, he says, has led to some dodgy practices: “There’s lots of snake oil being sold, products making claims they can’t prove. Some of these products have a lot to answer for – they don’t give a solution.”Wilson argues that part of the problem is that the industry doesn’t have a professional body, and needs more science to help people like him become more credible. He spent his teens suffering with insomnia and in work to help others in similar situations, but found a lack of options down an academic route\u0026nbspand started his career working at a charity that supports families with children that have sleeping problems.“There’s no such thing as sleep qualification in academia. I’m talking to public health charities and bodies who give qualifications to do something about it, I want there to be a practical qualification,” he says.While there are tens of thousands of nutritionists in the UK, there are very few sleep experts, and Wilson argues medical professionals aren’t trained enough to properly recognise and diagnose sleep problems.“Medical students don’t have much sleep knowledge, but sleep is fundamental to life. If you had a condition that meant your body couldn’t take in nutrients, you’d be sent straight to hospital. You can go longer without food than you can with sleep.”Tomorrow\u0027s workplace: How the world will look like in 2030Inspired by Disrupt to Stabilize: How Youth are Shaping a Fractured World Inspired by Transforming Healthcare in the 4th Industrial RevolutionInspired by in Technology We Trust?Inspired by From Linear to Expotential Value ChainsInspired by the Remaking of Global FinanceInspired by WPP Best Countries Breakfast Inspired by Disrupt to Stabilize: How Youth are Shaping a Fractured World Inspired by Transforming Healthcare in the 4th Industrial RevolutionInspired by in Technology We Trust?Inspired by From Linear to Expotential Value ChainsInspired by the Remaking of Global FinanceInspired by WPP Best Countries Breakfast Steve Robinson, founder of online shop We Sell Sleep, says while its products comes from research, including the personalised, 45-page sleep report customers can get for £20, a lot also comes from common sense.\u0026nbspSome think his products, including £215 light therapy glasses and magnesium supplements, are a load of nonsense, while others, he says, swear by them – including one customer who said a sleep mist solved his sleep problems. \u0026nbspBut as the industry booms, the science, he argues, will catch up. “The core of sleep science isn’t as evolved as other areas, but people are getting more obsessed with it, and once something gets commercial, there tends to be more money available for research.”And helping the industry boom, despite evidence suggesting work is the biggest stressor keeping us awake at night, are workplaces. Nap pod manufacturer Podtime has sold nearly 500 nap pods in 19 countries since launching eight years ago, predominantly to employers including Facebook and Nestle, whom director Paul Grindrod says are slowly coming around to the idea of napping on the job. \u0026nbspBut it took a while the company didn’t sell a single pod in its first few years, and one local authority cancelled its order with Podtime on the request of its ruling authority due to the stigma attached to napping at work. “We’re gradually overcoming this resistance, as people see the benefits to productivity.There was a time when office buildings didn’t have showers, but now many do,” he says. Grindrod, who likes to read his Kindle inside the pod, says the company doesn’t hire any scientists or commission any research, and tells clients to go online to see the benefits of sleep more generally.\u0026nbspBCIT) in Vancouver, Canada (Alamy)Wilson, however, says installing nap pods is “one of the worst things you can do,” and can exacerbate insomnia. “We have two internal systems that manage sleep: light and dark, and our internal sleep pressure, which counts down to bedtime from the moment we wake up,” he says.“Naps knock bedtime back. Using a nap pod sounds like the right thing to do, and people are doing it because they don’t know any better, but it’s not right for everyone”.Wilson argues that this is why a lot of the advice on sleep isn’t relevant – because it comes down to each inidual and how they sleep best. Headlines warning us that too little sleep causes almost every health problem under the sun aren’t helpful either, he argues, because one of the biggest reasons we can’t sleep is stress.One in seven of British couples prefer to sleep in separate bedsBad night’s sleep makes you fat and weak, study showsWhat happens when you try to catch up on sleep over the weekend“Warnings about how bad sleep is killing us means we wake up stressed in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep. We need to get people more relaxed about sleep,” he says. While it’s a nice sentiment, the booming sleep industry is likely to keep insisting there’s a problem to solve, especially if the beauty industry and the “help”\u0026nbspit offers consumers to “fix”\u0026nbspblackheads and cellulite, is anything to go by.Robinson likens the quality of our sleep to the efforts we put into other areas of life:\u0026nbsp“You could be fanatical about it and see a big improvement, or you can make some small differences and see some improvements. It’s the same as diet and exercise, it comes with a level of discipline.”The difference is, however, being sold the idea that we can solve our sleep problems with just a bit of effort and a lot of cash is deceiving. While we can all take steps to help us, it’s unlikely that a pillow mist or 20 minutes in a nap pod at work will cure a sleep disorder, and companies telling us they can will only make us more stressed out when we’re wide awake at 4am.

Well, eight housing associations have already been given such deals, worth almost £600m and paving the way for almost 15,000 new affordable homes.“And today, I can announce that new longer-term partnerships will be opened up to the most ambitious housing associations through a ground-breaking £2bn initiative. Under the scheme, associations will be able to apply for funding stretching as far ahead as 2028-29 – the first time any government has offered housing associations such long-term certainty.“Doing so will give you the stability you need to get tens of thousands of affordable and social homes built where they are needed most, and make it easier for you to leverage the private finance you need to build many more.”Ms May demanded associations achieve things neither private developers nor local authorities are capable of doing” and call on them to take the lead in transforming the very way in which we think about and deliver housing in this country by taking on and leading major developments themselves, rather than simply buying properties built by developers.She will also ask associations to help end the stigma around social housing, admitting that too many people, including politicians, look down on people who live in low-cost homes.“For many people, a certain stigma still clings to social housing. Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority, she will say.“And on the outside, many people in society – including too many politicians – continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.”She added: We should never see social housing as something that need simply be “good enough”, nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better.44bn to housing and commits to delivering 300,000 net additional homes per year by mid 2020\u0027sMs May used her speech at last year\u0027s Conservative Party conference to announce £2bn of new investment in low-cost housing - enough to build 5,000 new homes per year - although this was criticised as being significantly less than is needed.No 10 said the new £2bn was in addition to the amount announced last year.However, Labour said the latest cash injection would not be enough to reverse the impact of previous cuts to housing budgets.Government quietly drops plans to force councils to sell social homesNumber of social homes to fall by 230,000 by 2020, analysis revealsFewer social homes being built than at any time since Second World WarJohn Healey, Labour\u0027s shadow housing secretary, said: Theresa May’s promises fall far short of what’s needed.“Any pledge of new investment is welcome, but the reality is spending on new affordable homes has been slashed so the number of new social rented homes built last year fell to the lowest level since records began.“If Conservative ministers are serious about fixing the housing crisis they should back Labour’s plans to build a million genuinely affordable homes, including the biggest council housebuilding programme for over 30 years.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/17/12/frack-free-lancashire.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/17/12/frack-free-lancashire.jpg","title":"conservative revolt block fracking applications theresa may commons majority latest","story":"Created with Sketch.Fast-track proposal could mean\u0026nbsptest drilling\u0026nbsp\u0027at the end of your garden without you being able to have a say\u0027, ministers toldClick to followIndy PoliticsThe government is ploughing ahead in England - despite bans in Scotland and Wales and abroadControversial plans to strip local people of power to block fracking applications in trouble after Tory revoltControversial plans to strip local people of the power to block fracking applications are in trouble after a Tory backbench revolt.Up to 20 Conservative MPs are ready to rebel over the proposal, more than enough to wipe out Theresa May’s fragile Commons majority – even with the Democratic Unionist Party – of just 13.The proposal – to fast-track applications, by removing the need to obtain planning permission – have already triggered a grassroots revolt by Conservative councillors.Now Tory MPs have spoken out, saying around 20 “feel enraged to fight these proposals”, which are currently out to consultation.Ben Bradley, a former Tory vice-chairman, told the Financial Times: “Allowing it as permitted development potentially could mean they could install that infrastructure at the end of your garden without you being able to have a say.

It would be a thoroughly retrograde step for the government to pursue this.”Under the consultation, planning permission would still be required for the actual fracking, which involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to open cracks in the rock to extract oil or natural gas.However, earlier exploratory work, including test drilling, would proceed under “permitted development” – a form of approval normally used only for minor home improvements.The green group Friends of the Earth has condemned the “underhand move”, saying: “Local people and councils have rejected the overtures of the industry wherever it\u0027s tried to drill.UK news in picturesCar manufacturer BMW announced on September 18, 2018, that its Mini factory in the UK would close for its annual summer maintenance several weeks earlier than planned, starting on April 1, 2019, to avoid any disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit.It\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

Tomorrow over lunch the leaders are expected to discuss Brexit without Ms May there and reach a settled view on Chequers.\u0026nbsp“Brexit negotiations are entering their decisive phase. Various scenarios are still possible today, but I would like to stress that some of Prime Minister May’s proposals from Chequers indicate a positive evolution in the UK’s approach as well as a will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit,” Mr Tusk told reporters at the summit.“By this, I mean, among other things the readiness to cooperate closely in areas such as security and foreign policy. On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic cooperation, the UK’s proposals will need to be re-worked and further negotiated.“Today there is perhaps more hope but there is surely less and less time. Therefore every day that is left we must use for talks. I would like to finalise them still this autumn. This is why at tomorrow’s meeting of the 27 I will propose calling an additional summit around the mid of November.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Used fur products would be exempt.The council is considering an exemption for products used for religious purposes, such as fur hats worn by Orthodox Jews,\u0026nbspas well as for items made from pelts legally taken under the authority of a California fur-trapping license.Major fashion companies, including Michael Kors, Armani and Gucci, have also moved away from using fur. Earlier this month, Burberry said it would stop selling real fur.\u0026nbspActivists have condemned the fur industry as inhumane, arguing that the animals are subject to brutal conditions and torturous deaths.However, Keith Kaplan, a spokesman for the Fur Information Council of America, said that while full-length coats of sable and mink may not be as popular as they once were, fur is still found in around 70 per cent of the world’s latest autumn fashion collections.“If consumers weren’t buying it, fashion houses wouldn’t be designing it, and manufacturers wouldn’t be making it,” he said.He also disputed as “bogus” claims by animal rights groups that the methods employed by the fur industry are inherently cruel and inhumane.Retail fur sales globally accounted for $35.8bn (£27.2bn), and the fur industry employed more than one\u0026nbspmillion people in 2014, the latest year figures were available from the industry, Mr Kaplan said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMPs to ban import of animal furResponding to news of the ban, Humane Society International (HSI) called on the British government to work towards making the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of animal fur.Farming fur was made illegal in the UK in 2000, and EU law bans fur from domestic cats, dogs and hunted seals. However, Britain imports fur from other species including foxes and rabbits.Claire Bass, HSI UK’s executive director, said:\u0026nbsp“A cruel product like fur has no place in the City of Angels, and we applaud the Los Angeles City council for taking a moral stand.“Now it is time for the UK government to show equal compassion and listen to the vast majority of British people who want the UK to become the first country in the world to fully ban the sale of animal fur.“Our government has stated its ambition for the UK\u0026nbspto be ‘a world leader in animal welfare’, blazing a trail as the first country to outlaw the cruel and unnecessary fur trade would show that this ambition will be delivered with actions, not just words. The sale of cat, dog and seal fur is already banned here so now let’s finish the job and ban fur full stop.”Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/10/imran-khan-saudi.jpg","title":"imran khan saudi arabia pakistan prime minister medina muslim jidda","story":"Created with Sketch.Khan\u0027s choice of the kingdom for his first official visit, as well as comments from his finance minister, have led to speculation that Pakistan will seek a large loan from its Saudi allies to avoid another IMF bailoutClick to followThe IndependentImran Khan visits the Prophet\u0027s Mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia, during his first overseas trip since taking officePakistan’s new prime minister\u0026nbspImran Khan\u0026nbspis meeting for talks with the king of\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia, amid speculation he\u0026nbspwill use his first official\u0026nbspvisit to request\u0026nbspfinancial aid.Comments from the former cricketer’s finance minister suggested Pakistan would turn to its major allies like China and Saudi Arabia, rather than rely on another bailout from the International Monetary Fund.Mr Khan arrived in the kingdom on Tuesday and prayed at the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, where the doors to the\u0026nbspProphet Muhammad’s final resting place were opened in a sign of respect for the visiting dignitaries.He then flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia’s port city on the Red Sea, and will later dine with the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman\u0026nbspat a state dinner, before travelling to Abu Dhabi.\u0026nbspMr Khan bemoaned Pakistan’s financial situation in his first formal address as prime minister in August, saying\u0026nbspthat “never in Pakistan’s history have we faced such difficult economic circumstances”.\u0026nbspThe country’s fiscal deficit ballooned to 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product in the financial year to 30 June.He announced a series of austerity measures and raised taxes for middle and higher earners, but warned he would “have to take more debt to repay our obligations” to international lenders.Last month, finance minister Asad Umar said an IMF rescue was a fallback option and that the government was exploring other avenues for assistance.

His measured comments erged from an earlier, furious response.\u0026nbspIn the early morning, the Russian Defence Ministry intimated the plane had been hit\u0026nbspby Israeli or French fire. Later, spokesmen changed the story, accepting the plane had been shot down by the Syrians. But\u0026nbspthey ratcheted up the diplomatic fury.\u0026nbspIn quick succession, Moscow said Russians had died as a result of Israel’s “irresponsible actions.” It blamed the Israeli command for giving just a minute’s advance warning of its air strikes. It accused their pilots of using the larger Il-20 plane as cover during missions. It summoned the Israeli ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Smolenskaya Square and it gave Israel’s defence minister a public dressing-down.\u0026nbsp“The actions of the Israeli defence ministry do not reflect the spirit of the Russian-Israeli partnership,” Sergei Shoigu, the\u0026nbspRussian minister of defence\u0026nbsptold Israeli opposite number, Avigdor Lieberman. “We reserve the right to take further steps.”\u0026nbspThe fierce response suggested a difficult period ahead for Russian-Israeli relations.\u0026nbspUntil that point, cooperation between the two countries had been close. In May, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended Victory Day celebrations in Moscow in\u0026nbspa symbolic gesture at the height of the Kremlin’s international isolation. Russia also seemed to accept Israel’s strategic interests in the region.\u0026nbsp“There was a lot of trust between the two sides,” said Yuri Barmin, an expert at the Russian International Affairs Council on Tuesday. “It was seriously undermined today.”The incident brought back memories of November 2015, when a Turkish fighter shot down a Russian Su-24 jet that had violated Turkish airspace. Russia retaliated with sanctions and seven months of hostile relations\u0026nbspensued.Moscow is trying to be friends with everyone –\u0026nbspwith Assad, Israel, Turkey, the Kurds. That, of course, is the source of the problem\u0026nbspSome of Russia’s more excitable politicians suggested\u0026nbspMoscow could respond\u0026nbspby supplying\u0026nbspDamascus with more advanced C-300 anti aircraft systems – a kind that would prove more problematic for Israeli planners.\u0026nbsp“Russia simply can’t let this drop,” said Franz Klintsevich, member of the Russian senate’s Defence Committee.\u0026nbspBut the likelihood of a serious military response from Russia was always low. Even if it wanted to, Russia does not have the capacity to close Syrian air space to Israeli jets.More fundamentally, it was never going to wade into the undeclared war between Israel and Iran.\u0026nbsp“Russia will not stand in the way of Israeli operations to stop Iranian expansion, knowing how existential they are seen in Jerusalem,” said Jonathan Spyer, research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute of Strategic Studies. “Moscow is trying to be friends with everyone – with Assad, Israel, Turkey, the Kurds.\u0026nbspThat, of course, is the source of the problem.”\u0026nbspRussia-Turkey deal over buffer zone in Idlib met with scepticismUN warns of ‘worst humanitarian disaster’ of 21st century in SyriaRussia ‘resumes airstrikes’ on Syria’s Idlib despite Trump warningIn his afternoon comments, Mr Putin urged\u0026nbspagainst a direct comparison to the Turkish Su-24 incident. That was an intentional strike he said this was “an accident.”\u0026nbspThe president’s unexpectedly\u0026nbspmild response brought into question how much of the initial show of anger against Israel was real – and how much a tactic of\u0026nbspdeflection\u0026nbspfrom a military that had made mistakes.“Russia understood it has only itself to blame for not making sure the Syrians had the right friend-or-foe identification systems,” said Vladimir Frolov, a security expert and former Kremlin advisor.\u0026nbspThere were\u0026nbspother, more obvious questions to be asked. How was it that communication with Syrian allies broke down? How could an anti aircraft system mistake a large reconnaissance plane for a fighter jet?Part of the answer lay in the technology, suggested Justin Bronk, a research fellow at RUSI, an international defence and security think tank based in London.\u0026nbspDesigned in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, the Syrian S-200 surface to air missile unit is not a failproof system, he said. Without newer fire control and radar systems, it would have had difficulty differentiating between the two planes.A lax approach to firing the missiles may also have played a role.\u0026nbsp“During recent attacks, the Syrians have tried to give their public an impression of having effective defences,” said Mr Bronk. “So they have fired missiles blindly – on simple ballistic trajectories, or at least with very weak firing solutions. That may have contributed.”In a statement released on Twitter, the Israeli Defence Forces said the blame for the incident lay “firmly with the Syrian regime,” which had fired missiles “indiscriminately” in response to Israeli\u0026nbspairstrikes.\u0026nbspRussia understood it has only itself to blame for not making sure the Syrians had the right friend-or-foe identification systems\u0026nbspBut the statement also expressed “sorrow for the death of the aircrew members of the Russian plane”.\u0026nbspThat show of humility may have given Mr Putin enough to move on.\u0026nbsp“The operational dynamic may change slightly, but the politics can’t change,” added Mr Barmin. “Russian doesn’t have so many allies that it can throw one of them\u0026nbspunder the\u0026nbspbus.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/10/storm-ali-met-office.jpg  width= 913  height= 685  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/10/storm-ali-met-office.jpg","title":"storm ali caravan cliff winds ireland galway woman 50s uk weather","story":"Created with Sketch.Tens of thousands of customers without power amid perilous conditionsClick to followThe IndependentStorm Ali blows caravan off a cliff killing woman in her 50s insideA woman has reportedly died after winds from Storm Ali blew a caravan off a cliff with her\u0026nbspinside.The caravan fell over the cliff in County Galway, western Ireland, on Wednesday morning.Police and emergency workers arrived at the cliff site in\u0026nbspCladdaghduff\u0026nbspvillage as high winds still raged.\u0026nbspPolice said they recovered the body of a woman in her\u0026nbsp50s\u0026nbspafter an emergency call at about 7.45am\u0026nbsp​reported.Forecasters have issued an orange-level alert for more than half the country – the second-highest warning.A statement from Irish police said: “Gardai in Clifden, Co Galway are dealing with an incident which occurred at Claddaghduff, Co Galway this morning.“A caravan has blown off a cliff.

The fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British prime minister could accept such a concept.With just over six months to go before Britain leaves the EU, reaching agreement on a backstop arrangement for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic remains the thorniest issue in negotiations.British Prime Minister Theresa May rejected the previous EU proposal on how to avoid a hard border on the United Kingdom\u0027s only land border with the EU, saying it would effectively slice Northern Ireland away from mainland Britain, a position staunchly backed by her pro-British allies in Belfast.The concern is that Northern Ireland would have to be granted a special status \u0026mdash meaning it would effectively stay inside the EU economic space, but at the cost of new differences with the British mainland, which both Mrs May has complained would threaten British sovereignty.UK Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: )And after the her conservative government lost its majority in last year\u0026rsquos snap election, she is dependent on the support of DUP MPs to pass legislation.Speaking on the eve of the latest EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, Mr Barnier said negotiations were reahing the \u0026ldquomoment of truth.He said that the EU was ready to improve its proposal for the original insurance policy backstop plan for the Ireland issue.Mr Barnier revealed that he was reworking his plan to make clear how, in the event the \u0026ldquoinsurance policy were ever activated, it would not create a physical customs border on the Irish Sea, but instead operate by checks on goods along the Britain-Northern Ireland route.He said: \u0026ldquoOur proposal for the backstop on Ireland and Northern Ireland has been on the table since February. We are ready to improve this proposal.Mr Barnier added: \u0026ldquoClarifying which goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where. We can also clarify that most checks can take place away from the border, at the company premises or in the market.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a dead has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.The former Foreign Secretary claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of hard - Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees - Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis and Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000420437953.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady column alcohol vanity good health","story":"One day, butter is the enemy. The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.Triumphant Remoaners piled in. It proved Brexiteers were clueless, they chirped. And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too. The trouble being it wants it used between Britain and Northern Ireland instead of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.And the DUP, whom Theresa May needs for her survival, won’t wear that. Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m going to miss you so much and mum you too.“Rest easy up there, I love you both millions. I’m all alone now but I need to do you both very proud.“I need to try my very hardest but don’t you both worry because I will get through it.“I’m ever so broken, I’m the baby of us three but not any more, I’m one brave girl.“We’ve been sat here hours every day by your side.“Sleep tight, my sexy lady.

You always brought a smile to my face.“I really did have the best sister I could ever ask for.”Casey had recently ed from a trip to Ibiza and friends said that she “loved to party”.Pals wrote heartfelt tributes to the “dancing queen” and “beautul little angel” inside handprints they had drawn on the huge boards set up at the roadside shrine.There were also tributes to Casey’s friend Lucy Leadbeater, 27, another passenger in the car.The young mum died on Sunday after her le support was switched off.Two men who were in the car were taken to hospital where they were said to be in a stable condition.Kent Police said: At 3.48am on Friday, officers were on patrol when their attention was drawn to a Toyota Yaris parked on the A2 slip road towards Adisham Road.The vehicle left the scene and the officers subsequently attended Nethersole Road where they found the car had been involved in a collision.South East Coast Ambulance Service and Kent Fire and Rescue Service also attended the scene along with the air ambulance.An 18-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene while a second woman was taken to a London hospital in a critical condition.Two men were also taken to a local hospital in a stable condition."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434918565.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may ulstermatum brexit deal","story":"But the PM will get just ten minutes to argue her case.The meeting of the 28 national bosses in Salzburg is a key chance for her to unlock a stand-off with Commission negotiators by appealing directly to the 27 other national bosses.But, The Sun can reveal Mrs May’s bid to thrash out her Chequers plan for a trade deal with the group has been thwarted.Instead of a long debate with them - which was also pushed for by the host Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz – she will be given just 10 minutes to make a brief personal pitch.EU Council president Donald Tusk has shut down any debate with the table, insisting the others will discuss their response tomorrow without her.Revealing Mrs May’s ultimatum, a senior No10 official said last night: “To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.“Neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between dferent parts of the United Kingdom.“No other country would accept it  they were in the same situation.”Mrs May is furious that the EU’s negotiating chief Michael Barnier has refused to budge from the Irish Sea demand.A new plan by Mr Barnier – revealed by The Sun on Saturday – to police the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland with invisible technology has also been thrown out by No10.Mrs May will also appeal to the leaders that her Chequers plan for goods access to the single market but not services threatens the EU’s integrity.Diplomats in Brussels last night said EU leaders want to hear her the PM’s take on how things are going and what she wants from them to move things forward.But they won’t offer her any major concessions in Salzburg.Instead, warm words are likely to help Mrs May get through the Tories’ turbulent annual party conference in two weeks time.European Parliament chief negotiator dampened Mrs May’s hopes of a break through yesterday, insisting that while here security proposals were positive the EU “cannot accept” her plan for a customs arrangement or a common rule book on goods.Senior MEP and former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt told Euronews: “The problem with Chequers for the European Union is in the economic and trade part”.Mr Verhofstadt also called Mrs May’s bluff on no deal, insisting “she knows very well it is not an option”.Ireland yesterday attacked suggestions from some countries for a “blind Brexit” fudge of delaying key decisions just to allow Britain to leave the EU and pays a orce bill.The Prime Minister expressed her optimism on how Britain will make a success of Brexit on the eve of the EU Summit.She said: “Brexit gives us the opportunity to build a better future and to help people to realise the British dream.”In an interview with the  Mrs May said the Chequers plan will deliver for the people.She said: “I believe that what we’re proposing is the Brexit that delivers the freedoms that people voted for – making our own laws, controlling our own borders, controlling our money.“What I hear from other EU leaders is a recognition of that timetable and a recognition of the importance of showing we can sit down and come to an agreement.“The withdrawal agreement is virtually agreed. Chequers is about the future relationship. I’m putting on the table what we think is the right plan for the UK.”Mrs May also shut down any suggestions that the country could face a People’s Vote.She said: “My answer to the People’s Vote is that we’ve had the people’s vote, it was the referendum – and now we should deliver on it.“I’m confident that we can get a good deal and when people come to look at that as the final end point in these negotiations, I hope people will reflect on the fact that we did give a vote to the people.”Taking a swipe at her Tory Eurosceptic critics she said they have failed produce a detailed alternative to her plans.She said: “The plan that is on the table, the plan that delivers on the Brexit vote but also protects jobs and maintains the unity of the UK, is the Chequers plan. I haven’t seen another plan that delivers on all of those.”Foreign minister Simon Coveney said: “There’s a danger in my view when dficult choices and dficult negotiations need to happen, that decisions get pushed off into November into December. We can’t allow that”.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab warned EU leaders that it’s now the EU’s turn to compromise as the UK has already offered up signicant concessions in the Chequers blueprint.In an article carried by a series of European newspapers, Mr Raab said: ““We made compromises and we showed ambition — and we do need to see that matched on the EU side.“We have shown a lot of flexibility and we have been very pragmatic. So I think this is the moment to see that matched. The ball is a little bit in the other court now”.Mr Barnier confirmed that the EU was ready to come forward with an improved plan for the Irish border - first revealed by The Sun on Saturday.But the proposal - which would see the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland policed with invisible technology - has already been thrown out by No10.Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Mr Barnier said: We are ready to improve this proposal. Work on the EU side is ongoing.We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed, he said.We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets. We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.A position at once grotesquely offensive, historically illiterate, grievously insulting and — more happily — a fantasy.How dare EU “diplomats” crassly equate the decision facing Theresa May this autumn with Britain standing alone against Nazi bombers? Do ours speak of the Germans or French like that? No.More to the point, Brussels should recall how Britain responded in 1940: with defiance . . . and victory.And Michel Barnier is dreaming  he thinks he can bind a future Government. If we want to elect one committed to severing EU ties further we will.Today, dismissive EU leaders will give Mrs May just ten minutes of their precious time. How can Remainers still defend this outfit? It’s run like the Mob.If and when Brussels finally springs its trap on the PM she must be able to change course instantly or walk away.Voters will be merciless , in panic, they are sold down the river.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hero remains to continue being............ed home to the United States. Also, North and South Korea will file a joint bid to host the 2032 Olympics.

but he was still wedded to keeping Northern Ireland inside EU rules  there was no Brexit deal.But Mrs May will use the summit to warn that there will be No Deal on Brexit unless the demands to cut up the UK by putting a border in the Irish sea are dumped.Writing in German newspaper Die Welt and a number of others today, she accused the bloc of trying to put demands on her which no other country would accept.She wrote: Just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same. Neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other.And on her Chequers plan - which the EU has said wont work either - she slapped them down for rejecting their ideas which are seen elsewhere.Later the PM will appeal to the other 27 leaders to unlock talks and go over the heads of the European Commission to push ahead towards a deal.What we are proposing is a fair arrangement that will work for the EU’s economy as well as for the UK’s without undermining the single market,” she is expected to say.This would be balanced by a strong security relationship to keep all our citizens safe from threats at home and abroad.The PM will have just a few minutes to make her case to the other leaders, and will join them for a working dinner later.But EU leaders are ided on how to deal with the talks - with some wanting the wording to be vague and allow room to move later, and others wanting a clear, detailed proposal on the table now.But little is expected to be achieved in the next few days - and instead a few warm words are predicted to get Mrs May through her annual party conference in two weeks time.The ex-Brexit secretary also said that he thinks talks between the EU and Britain will completely break down later this year, and will require a reset.Speaking as Theresa May flies to Salzburg to try and sell her plans to other leaders, he warned that her deal meant we would be subsurvient to Brussels for ever.He told Radio 4: Its always the case - the EU move at the last possible moment - after they have taken you to the clf edge.I think well get to a point where she will not be able to accept what they offer, and they will not accept what she offers. They will have to have some kind of reset.He then predicted that it would come to a point where several other deals would be on the cards instead, and then would be a crucial time to push for a free trade agreement which EU bosses has said would be possible earlier this year.There are plenty of precedents for this, Mr Davis said. There are ready made deals hanging around.The Brexiteer said Brussels would pile on more requests, demands, and asks for more money in the next few months.He said that warm words would be seen today but little action.They want to keep the PM alive, they will see the pressure shes under here back here, they will make her le possible, but they wont give much.The Brexiteer, who is fighting for Theresa May to chuck her current Brexit ideas, said that his plans to negotiate forever wouldnt work.He wrote in The  today in a clear jibe at Mr Gove: Chequers pleases nobody other than the Prime Minister herself. The idea of negotiating forever is so silly that only a very clever person would have come up with it.Last weekend the environment secretary said that getting out now was key, and a future Prime Minister would have the option of securing another agreement  they wanted to.This caused fuming EU bosses to demand that any deal should not be allowed to be unpicked.Mr Rees-Mogg added today: Once a deal is done it will survive for a generation because no one will want to reopen it and the other pressing issues of government will need to be dealt with.The answer remains to chuck Chequers and go for a free trade deal that is on offer and works with the ERG’s effective answer to the Irish question.The Brexit talks are deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border.Brussels wants an operational backstop in place to prevent a so-called hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.But that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EUs single market and customs union.Theresa May simply wont accept this because it will effectively break up the UK and put a virtual border in the Irish sea.And it will infuriate her coalition partners, the DUP, too, who she relies on to win votes in the House of Commons.A new plan by Mr Barnier – revealed by The Sun on Saturday – to police the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland with invisible technology has also been thrown out by No10.Britain wants an agreement to not be needed, by agreeing a close partnership with the EU which would make the backstop void.Yesterday EU boss Michel Barnier hinted that a deal could be reached, and that he was willing to sht proposals on the Irish border at a meeting next month.Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Mr Barnier said: We are ready to improve this proposal.

I know what and who he is.Sesame Street has since been accused of double standards for saying the duo are just puppets... with no sexual orientation when, only three years ago, it confirmed Kermit and Miss Piggy were in a romantic relationship.Yoda actor Oz, 74, who has voiced the beloved yellow puppet since 1969, was responding directly to claims made by longtime script and songwriter Saltzman.Saltzman, who joined the iconic kids show in 1984, effectively outed Bert and Ernie in what proved to be a controversial interview with Queerty.He said he based them on his own relationship with film editor Arnold Glassman, ending a decades-long debate over whether the Muppets who shared a basement apartment on 123 Sesame Street, but slept in dferent beds, were lovers.Unfortunately for many, Oz poured cold water over the revelation last night.In his original post, the Hereford-born actor and puppeteer said: It seems Mark Saltzman was asked  Bert \u0026amp Ernie are gay.Its fine that he feels they are. Theyre not, of course. But why that question? Does it really matter?Why the need to define people as only gay? Theres much more to a human being than just straightness or gayness.Comic duo Bert and Ernie were jointly created by English-born actor Frank Oz and American puppeteer Jim Henson.Henson started by performing Bert and Oz voicing Ernie but after a few rehearsals, they switched roles.The famous pair were apparently the only characters to feature in the July 1969 pilot episode.They are also among a handful of characters to appear on The Muppet Show and the 1974 Muppet Valentine Show.Mark Saltzman, who suggested the characters were gay, began working on the show in New York in 1984.He said he wrote the characters based on his own same sex relationship with Arnold Glassman.But Jon Stone, another writer on the show, said they were based on the real le frienship between Oz and Henson.The idea behind the characters was to show that two people with wildly dferent personalities could still get on.Social media turned on Oz for shattering the hearts of millions so brutally and argued the characters have evolved beyond their original parameters into icons for gay young people.Reed Brice wrote: You may have created him, but you dont seem to realise what he meant to thousands of little boys growing up.You digging in your heels  with what seems like disgust is disappointing.Smith Knight added: Some kids who watched Sesame Street were gay. Like me. I loved Sesame Street and I was gay.But I wasnt allowed to see people who were like me on TV, and that SAID something to me.An anonymous user said: Woulda thought you coulda kept your a** out of this conversation, for the sake of both Ernie and Bert.Glassmans nephew Keith today told Sun Online he was very proud of Saltzman for lting the lid on Bert and Ernie.He added: Always have been [proud]. Two of the most wonderful people we have ever known.They were the original odd couple: Ernie the carefree goofball to Berts serious and easily-riled grouch.But amid all the squabbling and pranks, the pair shared touching moments of real affection and joy.Here are just a few...Bert and Ernie do ChristmasBert is in the bath when he gets a brilliant idea of what to get Ernie: A soap dish for his yellow rubber duck.Moments later, Ernie finds one of Berts beloved paperclips on the ground and decides hes going to get him a box to place them in.But Ernie has no money, so he trades his little ducky for a cigar box at Mr Hoopers pawn shop.Bert too is a little short of cash so he swaps what he brands the greatest paper clip collection in the Western world for the plate.The pair are touched to discover the sacrice the other made for them and in the end, Mr Hooper s their beloved items.50 shades of ErnieErnie decides to play a little game: He puts on a blindfold and has a little rummage around their apartment to see  he can guess what hes feeling.The first thing he reaches, of course, is Berts bouffant black hair.Its kind of soft and fluffy-like, Ernie starts. And its sticking straight up like a shaggy rug.With Bert getting more frustrated, Bert moves down to his bath sponge-like nose.Ernies hands move almost off camera  as he says: It feels sort of smooth and thin. Its floppy like a garden hose!The friendship testBerts reading a riveting book about oatmeal when Ernie comes straight out with it: Bert, do you like me?His pal replies: Of course I like you, youre my best friend.Ernies satisfied but he has another test for his housemate: He goes off camera and s with a rather garish hat on his head.Would you still like me  I wore fruit on my head? he asks, to which Berts answer is still yes.Ernie replaces Berts noseSomehow, Berts nose has fallen clean off his face and the monobrowed-Muppet needs help getting it back on.Of course Ernie cant resist the opportunity to have some fun at his mates expense and places it on his cheek.I dont think thats quite right, Bert says in his trademark nasally tone.Ernie gets Bert a puppyWhat relationship  is truly complete without a pet?Ernie saw to that in typically thoughtful fashion when he surprised his mate with an adorable dog.After some unsuccessful guessing at what the surprise could be, he reveals that hes brought home.Thankfully Ernie loves him and the video ends with them arguing over whether they should call him Norman or Godzilla the Wonder Dog.On the characters sexuality, Keith said: Enjoyed them as a child, never thought about their sexuality.

up on new zealand beach","story":"Adam Dickinson, 31, found the bizarre-looking creature while on a day out with his we and two young children.In photos it appears as a number of purple blobs arranged in a circle, bounded by a sun-shaped ring of white jelly.Now the creature has been identied by New Zealands National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research as a lions mane jellyfish - the worlds largest known species.When underwater the creatures tentacles can trail up to 190ft - longer than a blue whale.Adam, who visited the beach with his we Eve, 34, and his children Lucas, four, and Sofia, two, said the they came across the creature on Pakiri beach, 42 miles north of Auckland.He said: We had been out walking and there was up to 100 jellyfish along the estuary and beach.At the end, after about an hour, we came across this one.It almost looked alien-like and was slowly moving or contracting.Our initial reaction was impressed, because its an amazing looking thing.Though its stings are rarely fatal, the large number of tentacles mean that medical attention is often recommended after exposure.In July 2010, the broken-up remains of one such jellyfish were big enough to sting some 150 beachgoers near the US town of Rye, New Hampshire.Adam said his kids initially ran up to the jelly fish to take a closer look with his son confirming it was still alive.He said: They pack a hell of a punch, I have been told.I had turned a few jellyfish upside down to explain to the kids not to touch the tentacles, but this was the only one I actually wouldnt touch.I have been here nine years and had seen nothing like that.The colossal creatures mouth is situated on the bell’s underside, surrounded by tentacles that are ided into eight clusters of up to 150 tentacles each, according to conservation group Oceana.These tentacles contain poison which stun the jellyfish’s prey when they are enveloped.Lion’s mane jellyfish eat small fish, tiny crustaceans and even other jellyfish.The top of the bell is usually dark yellow or red in colour and thick in the centre, but thins out towards the edges.The animal also possess bioluminescent abilities, meaning it’s able to produce its own light and glow in the dark underwater.Jellyfish actually thrive in areas that are affected by human activity such as climate change, pollution and overfishing, scientic research has suggested.These factors reduce their main predators and competitors and can increase the number of the species on which prey.The lions mane jellyfish is regularly seen in the waters of the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea and around Scandinavia.While the lions mane is the biggest jellyfish, the deadliest is the irukandji.The irukandji jellyfish is almost impossible to see in water as it is about the size of a match head and has a transparent body.A teenage girl bitten one off the coast of Australia earlier this year was in so much pain, she said she begged her mum to let her die."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435149387.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"portsmouth university freshers week 5000 students big night

North Korea”.The extraordinary rant was kicked off after an aide said the MP would not appear on today’s programme “following his treatment last time” at the hands of fellow presenter Ranvir Singh.Mr Morgan then read out a letter in a mocking fashion from the minister’s special advisor explaining they were also unhappy at his tweets earlier this week which criticised Theresa May and Brexit.The TV host said Mr Brokenshire “is doing every other programme apart from us today” to discuss the PM’s pledge  to spend an extra  £2billion for social housing, and hit out at his “SPAD” – shorthand for special adviser.He said they “are these weird little creatures” that work for them, adding they “are awful little people most of the time”.Then in a mocking, nasal voice he read out a letter from the aide saying they were not going to appear, saying: It wasn’t with us with us last time actually, but that monster Ranvir Singh, that chewed him up, that well-known monster.”His colleague, who was appearing live from Downing Street, joked that: “Im a Rottweiler when you’re not here!”Mr Morgan said the letter went on to say: “Piers’ tweets following the Panorama special on Theresa May making clear he does not think the PM is a leader and that Brexit is quotes a farce, and that he cannot be trusted by us to do a fair and balanced interview with James.”Ms Reid quipped: “We live in North Korea apparently.”Her co-host then blasted the minister, saying: “The truth is youre an unbelievably boring person. I didnt even know we were going to be interviewing you,  Id have known I would have cancelled you.“And you’re now banned from ever appearing on Good Morning Britain as long as Im sitting in this chair.He went on to call the former Northern Ireland Secretary a jumped-up little prima donna, adding: Who do you think you are, seriously?An exasperated Ms Reid added: Brilliant, weve just completely broken the relationship with the housing office.But Mr Morgan doubled down on his criticism, saying  any other ministers only want to go on GMB to “praise the great leader Theresa and say Brexit is terric then youre all banned”.His colleague pleaded with him to relent, saying: “Please Id quite like to interview a government minister again.”Mr Morgan hit back, saying “they’re normally pretty boring”, and again hitting out at Mr Brokenshire’s aide, adding: “This is the most

My husband and I would very much like to get a baby aged 0 to 3 months.“All the documents for adoption are ready. Please send a private message for details. Girls, darlings, please help.”Inna - at the time pregnant after a short relationship with a man she met at a local cafe - replied: “Hello, I would like my daughter to be adopted.“Please do so, I am not able to raise her, no chance.”She told police she lived with her mother and sister in a cramped apartment and the other two women were furious when she became pregnant.Omsk prosecutor Vasily Gumenyuk said: “During our interrogation, the biological mother of the baby explained that she lived in a rented apartment with her mother and sister.“Both were strongly against the baby and put strong psychological pressure on the future mother.”The baby deal would have remained secret but for Inna and her mother telling their landlady - who immediately informed police.She admitted she could have given the child up at her maternity hospital but chose not to and instead to hand the baby to Natalia who she had not previously met.She said she was paid 3,000 roubles – just £34 - sent in advance allegedly to cover the cost of nappies.But she claimed Natalia also promised to help her and her family find jobs in St Petersburg.Asked about the moment she handed over the child, she said: “Of course it was hard.“I was in hysterics in the airport when it happened.“But Natalia’s  flight has already been announced - I had to give her my daughter so  could catch their plane.”Inna added: “The father of the baby was not interested before but now he says, ‘give me the baby, I will take care of her’.“But he is not serious.  He is 23, there are no babies in his le plans.”She said: “Most likely, I will never see my baby again…“If only could I go back over everything, I would not have given her away.”The child is now likely to be put in an orphanage.Natalia told police that she had planned to try and legally adopt another baby.But she said the rules on her living conditions and salary would have meant she was not qualied.The women were both detained as suspects under Russia’s child trafficking laws.They are held under house arrest pending completion of the criminal investigation."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000359373976.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remoaners claim there are six chances for a second brexit referendum but theresa may vows to trust the people","story":"The campaigners fighting to keep Britain in the EU claim there are several opportunities for the public to have another say, just as the Prime Minister again ruled it out under any circumstances.The Peoples Vote campaign claim they want Brits to vote AGAIN on leaving the bloc, despite the decisive result of the 17 million people who opted for Brexit in June 2016.They said that voters should get a choice for leaving with or without a deal, or keep us in the EU altogether.But Britain is still on track to leave the EU in March next year, just a few months away.Negotiations on our withdrawal agreement and what our future trading relationship might look like are still ongoing.Remain campaigners say that  MPs reject the PMs deal,  she cant get one with the EU at all, or  MPs force a vote in the Commons, another referendum could be on the cards.And they even suggest that Mrs May could call one HERSELF.Even the ex-education secretary, Justine Greening said today the PMs plans are undemocratic and the people must have another say.But today Treasury minister Mel Stride warned that there could be another vote  Mrs Mays Chequers deal is rejected by MPs.She told Sky: If that deal does not prevail, they will end up in the situation where we could have a second referendum or we could end up not leaving the EU altogether, so there is a danger of that happening  Chequers does not prevail.But the Lib Dems are the only party who think Britain should vote again on Brexit.Today the PM slapped campaigners down yet again, saying that she would trust the British people that they made the right call.She told The : We gave people the opportunity to make a choice. They made that choice.If we as politicians want people to trust us, then we have to deliver for them on that.This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country’s history. If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.She went on: People weren’t saying it’s the choice of the public except  we disagree with the answer we’ll ask them again. It was the public’s choice.My answer to the People’s Vote is that we’ve had the people’s vote – it was the referendum – and now we should deliver on it.And she added that the public now want the Government to just get on with it.David Davis, the ex-Brexit secretary, also poured cold water on the Remainers ideas today.He told Radio 4 another vote was pretty unlikely as a second vote would invite the EU to give us the worst possible deal so we will stay in... its against the national interest. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Sky campaign also includes a petition to parliament. After 10,000 signatures, petitions get a response from the government and after 100,000 they are considered for a Commons debate.The first party leader to back the Sky News campaign was the Lib Dems\u0027 Sir Vince Cable, who praised the channel\u0027s 2010 TV election debates and said: \"They energised the whole election campaign.\"It\u0027s surely right that the ground rules should be decided in a non-political independent environment of the kind you suggest.\"We should now be putting this structure in place so there\u0027s no argy-bargy in the few weeks before the next general election.\" Sir Nick, another former Lib Dem leader, wrote in an article for Sky News: \"These debates should be an immovable part of a general election in this country and a key component of our democratic process.\"They should not be in the gt of whichever political party is in power, or whichever politician is ahead in the polls.\"Former Tory home secretary Ms Rudd, who took Theresa May\u0027s place in a debate when the prime minister refused to attand, said: \"I think the public do expect it and I think they\u0027re entitled to it.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"Joining Ms Rudd is leading Eurosceptic Tory MP Peter Bone, who said the plan is closely aligned to one he has already tabled in a private member\u0027s bill which is due to have its second reading in the Commons in March.When he first tabled the bill, its sponsors included the former TV presenter Esther McVey, now in the cabinet as work and pensions secretary, and another veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP, Sir Christopher Chope.Mr Bone now hopes to attract more sponsors.\"These debates should not be left to the political parties,\" he said.\"They should be decided by an independent commission and we need to get this sorted out, not in the frenzy of a general election but before.\" For the Scottish National Party, media spokeswoman Hannah Bardell MP welcomed the Sky News campaign, saying the party has always supported leaders debates and other parties should \"catch up\".She said the SNP would support an independent commission as long as there was \"fair representation for all parties\", claiming they had been \"stitched up\" in the past and shut out from debates.Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas has also backed the campaign, saying debates should not be based on \"back-room deals between politicians and broadcasters\".Her successor, Natalie Bennett, added her support but said a leaders debate could not just be between England\u0027s two largest parties. James Harding, head of BBC News until last January, has also backed the campaign, telling Sky News: \"The argument is not about who\u0027s going to win, the argument is about politics and public trust.\"It\u0027s about saying that all our politicians reach the largest number of people.\"Willie Sullivan, senior director at the Electoral Reform Society, said a leaders debate is \"essential for the health of our democracy\".\"If a politician believes they are qualied to run the country, they should be willing and able to express the reasons why to the nation,\" he added.

Announcing the launch of the campaign, John Ryley, head of Sky News, said: \"This is all about doing what\u0027s best for the voting public.\"Sky News, along with the other broadcasters, changed the political landscape in this country by creating the first leaders\u0027 debates eight years ago.\"Sadly, it stands as an exception rather than the watershed it should have been."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-brexit-union-flag_4376949.jpg?20180731190538 ","title":"where are we at with brexit your questions answered","story":"This is largely because charity rescue vessels are finding it harder and harder to operate because Italy will not let them dock.The migration issue continues to fuel a political crisis across the continent.So it will be a key focus  for EU leaders.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said in a letter to fellow leaders: \"The quest to end the migration crisis is a common task of all the member states and EU institutions.\"If some want to solve the crisis, while others want to use it, it will remain unsolvable.\"I am hoping that in Salzburg we will be able to put an end to the mutual resentment and  to a constructive approach.\":: So what about Brexit? Will it be discussed?Absolutely. To some extent the summit has morphed into a key Brexit staging post.There won\u0027t be any formal conclusions or formal changes to the position of the EU - this is an informal summit and the rigidity of EU processes mean they cannot suddenly change course.But there could be subtle indicators of positions being moulded.:: Any key moments to look out for?Yes - at the leaders dinner Theresa May will have time to state the UK position.It is the first time that the leaders have all met as one since Britain\u0027s Chequers proposal  was revealed back in July. So expect her to eyeball her colleagues with a detailed explanation of what that means.There will be elements, no doubt, of what she said to German newspaper Die Walt this week: \"We are near to achieving the orderly withdrawal that is the essential basis for building a close future partnership.\"To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.\"Neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between dferent parts of the United Kingdom.\" Towards the end of the summit the 27 remaining members of the EU will meet without Mrs May to discuss Brexit.After that President Tusk and Mrs May will have a 10 minute meeting.There she will hear, in private, what the 27 think, collectively, of her position. Immediately afterwards she will give a news conference.:: Are the two sides really worried about there being a \u0027no-deal\u0027 clf-edge withdrawal?Yes. President Tusk made that very clear in his letter to EU leaders: \"Unfortunately, a no deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.\"In my sideline chats, EU and UK diplomats are even more blunt. A \"no-deal\" by accident is unnecessarily possible - each blames the other\u0027s intransigence.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"It prompted the resignation of then Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson, both of whom thought the proposal did not deliver the Brexit people voted for.And the EU side has consistently said Chequers isn\u0027t workable because it ides the integrity of the EU\u0027s single market by \"cherry picking\" the favourable parts of it.:: What\u0027s holding things up?There are two singular and distinct problems holding up the Brexit process.The first is part of the orce deal - the actual process of Brexit - and it\u0027s the \"Irish backstop\" problem.Britain has committed to leaving the single market and the customs union.By definition that means checks need to take place at hard borders between the UK and the EU unless or until some sort of mutual trade deal can be established. It is known as the \"backstop\" because it is a fallback position that the EU insists must be \"legally operable\" in case no better arrangement in the form of a trade deal  materialises.But it is a problem on the island of Ireland where no one wants to see the a  of hard borders between the north and the south.The EU\u0027s answer is for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs union. They say that checks can take place as goods pass between the British mainland and Northern Ireland and point out some agricultural checks already take place.The UK says that is not possible because putting Northern Ireland in a separate customs zone breaks up the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The second problem relates to the framework for the future relationship. This needs to be ironed out and put in a formal text - a political declaration - as part of the Brexit process.However the British Chequers proposal for the future relationship does not fly with the EU side.They think it represents a partial customs union on goods but no customs union on services and no freedom of movement.That, for Brussels, is cherry picking and undermines the integrity of the EU - other countries will want the same they fear and the whole single market/customs union project falls apart.It is quite easy to find compromise on the political declaration or to fudge it and deal with it later, post-Brexit day. It\u0027s much harder with the Irish backstop which is more binary and immediate.:: How\u0027s the relationship between the two sides?Not great. The British perception that the EU side isn\u0027t budging despite signicant compromises on their part is a source of huge frustration.The EU is angered by suggestions in the UK, by the Brexit secretary and prime minister no less, that they won\u0027t pay the \"exit bill\"   there is no deal.The EU was alarmed by Michael Gove\u0027s suggestion that whatever deal is done on the future framework, it can always be unravelled after Brexit day. ."},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated14:44, 7 SEP 2018NewsOn the go?

Leave that kid\u0027s lunch aloneTyrant teachers checking every child\u0027s lunch is school dinner madnessShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist12:37, 19 SEP 2018Updated13:39, 19 SEP 2018Newsopinion\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYellow belly custard, green snot pie. Mix it all together with a dead dog\u0027s eye. Slap it in a bucket nice an\u0027 thick, and wash it all down with a cup of cold sick. So ran one of the politer songs in the playground at my school, back in the days when there was actually money to spend on giving every primary-age pupil a hot meal at lunchtime. The best that could be said of the food we were subjected to was that it was hot. Otherwise, it was vegetables with the goodness boiled out of them, meat sliced so thinly it looked ill, and strange experiments involving batter.  The bowl of fresh fruit was dusted off optimistically each day by the dinner ladies and studiously ignored by everyone, and the lucky kids were the ones with a She-Ra lunchbox and a cheese sandwich made by their mum.  The only dish I ever went back for seconds of was slabs of chocolate sponge, baked in an enormous 2ft tray, slathered in mint-flavoured green custard. I\u0027d kill for a bowl of that even today.  Nowadays there are very few kitchen staff, zero dinner ladies patrolling to make sure you\u0027ve emptied your plate, and no basic training in negotiating skills enabling you to trade your peas for someone else\u0027s carrots. There\u0027s just tyranny. Tyranny always begins reasonably. So it was that Turkey Twizzlers were rightly discovered to be an atrocity against the digestive system, and Jamie Oliver campaigned for a school dining revolution. But those good intentions led to guidelines, and idiots interpreted them as rules, and no-one is allowed to question the not-rules for fear of being denounced as a Bad Parent.  Which gets us to the point where a child whose mum takes so much care over the lunchbox that she turns cucumber slices into tiny little flowers is told that it was too unhealthy.   Now, I\u0027d agree with that statement. I\u0027d say cutting the crusts off the sandwiches is unhealthy, asking anyone to eat celery without humous is inhuman, and as cucumbers are 96% water they\u0027re a waste of chewing. But the teacher in this case took the view that the three mini cookies in the top right corner were a dietary abomination, forbid the child from eating them, and sent them home with a note for mother.  Never mind that perhaps the parent included them as a treat to make up for the fun-free meal. Never mind that the ingredients of cookies - flour, butter, sugar - are the main constituents of most human food and in a balanced diet of no concern at all. And never mind that chocolate is considered a superfood.  To that teacher, cookies were a Turkey Twizzler in disguise, and kids that eat treats must be saved from their parents.  Of course there are parents who send their children to school with a packet of Quavers and a Coke. And of course those children are going to be disruptive, hyperactive, and ill  it carries on for too long. When that happens the sensible course of action is to find out why. Are the parents dead? Are they asleep? Have they run out of money and giving the child whatever they can nick from a pub? Perhaps the child has severe autism and vomits  asked to eat something else.  If a child is obese, they\u0027re chugging most of their calories at home. Any child with an atrocious diet probably has other problems, and banning them from eating the one thing they can or will eat is not going to solve the underlying issue.  It just tells parents, and pupils, that teachers get it wrong, and must be gone around. So they hide it, lie, or avoid education altogether.   Tyranny grows when it doesn\u0027t know where to stop. And so there are schools where a teacher bans cheese because it is mostly fat, and ignores the fact it\u0027s good fat and comes along with calcium. There are schools were lettuce is encouraged but not checked to see  it was washed, and where a potato is considered starchy, rather than a source of fibre and energy.   Any child\u0027s lunch box can be decimated by the application of stupidity and a food fad. The truth is every cell in your body only metabolises because there is some sort of sugar in your diet, and there is a dference between refined and unrefined, fructose and glucose. Unless you are in the 1% of the population with coeliac disease there\u0027s no harm at all in gluten, you can\u0027t move a muscle without carbohydrate as fuel, and a diet high in fats can reduce a child\u0027s risk of seizures.  The latest studies show children\u0027s yoghurts have lots of sugar. Well, broccoli has a fair bit of sugar too, and zero Vitamin D. Under the teacher tyranny, both should be banned. Most parents grew up in a world filled with toad-in-the-hole, vegetable splodge and green custard, and most of us are not obese, sick or dead. Some of us used to eat dirt, or in my case sugar lumps by the handful. I still have my own teeth and a waistline. It must be something other than celery, or a lack thereof, which is causing the problem of malnourished children.  We live in a world where teachers are asked to police. Where parents are required to parent in ways no parent has ever done before, children are infantilised all the way through university and there\u0027s a new food fad every 5 minutes claiming to fix all your problems. We don\u0027t live in a world where we are encouraged to find out  something is true. We\u0027re just asked to believe. So we rail against processed food, and forget that every single thing which isn\u0027t covered in dirt has been processed. Milk is pasteurised, flour is ground, corn is hulled. We buy vegetables from supermarkets where they\u0027re waxed, gassed, and given chemical washes. We hope the sausages are pork, we don\u0027t ask why the bread lasts so long and we\u0027re told that pizzas will kill our whole families.  The Italians eat pizza but live for a long time. But perhaps that\u0027s because they make the pizzas, using flour and oil and eggs, mush the tomatoes to make passata and scatter whatever is in the fridge as a topping.  So tell me this. If I make sandwiches using chicken saved from the Sunday roast, jam I made myself without preservatives, and add some raisins and a home-made fairy cake with raspberries from the garden, how much of it would a teacher let my daughter eat?

The Prime Minister will tell the National Housing Federation conference that “our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens.”   Leaving aside how many of her friends and neighbours in her wealthy Berkshire village actually live in social housing, Mrs May’s speech is a bit rich from someone who voted against making rented homes fit for human habitation, imposed the bedroom tax, put up council taxes for council tenants, introduced market rates for council house tenants, forced housing associations to sell off properties and continues to break the promise for like-for-like replacements for every council house sold .        Then there is the Tory obsession with right-to-buy which helped promulgate the stigma of council housing while leaving many families unable to live in the community in which they were brought up.   And there is the help-to-buy scheme which primarily benefited those on middle incomes and fuelled housing demand when the focus should have been on supply.   Just as with her just about managing speech on the steps of Downing Street, the Prime Minister identies the problem but is blinkered to the damage caused by her own policies.   Mrs May is promising housing associations an additional \u0026pound2billion in funding but it is not clear where the money is coming from  or over what time period it will be delivered.

The idea is included in a 239-page report by the Initiative for Free Trade - a think tank backed by hard Brexiteers and launched by Boris Johnson in the Foreign Office map room. Spelling out an \u0027ideal\u0027 trade deal between the US and UK, the report says there should be zero restrictions on competition for government procurement. An executive summary of the report explains: Health services are an area where both sides would benefit from openness to foreign competition, although we recognize any changes to existing regulations will be extremely controversial. Perhaps, then, for other areas the initial focus should be on other fields such as education or legal services, where negotiators can test the waters and see what is possible.  That said, we would envisage a swt, time-tabled implementation of recognition across all areas within 5 years. It adds import restrictions that are based on unsubstantiated public health and safety concerns should be dropped - leading to fears chlorine-washed chicken could be imported.  Labour MP Peter Kyle, of the anti- Brexit People’s Vote campaign, said: “This is the real agenda of the Brexit elite, in black and white.  They want to use Brexit as an excuse to slash and burn the protections and standards we value so highly, and to chop up and sell off our NHS to the highest bidder. The report also recommends free movement of workers between the UK and the US,  they have a confirmed job to go to. The IFT was launched last year as the Institute for Free Trade, but dropped \u0027institute\u0027 from its name after a dispute with Companies House.

Mel Stride blurted out the prediction that MPs could trigger a new public vote  they reject Theresa May\u0027s \u0027Chequers\u0027 plan for Brexit .  The Treasury minister told Sky News: Those to the right of the party - the pro-Brexit wing - will be very concerned that  that deal doesn\u0027t prevail, they\u0027ll end up in the situation where we could have a second referendum and we could end up not leaving the EU altogether. So there is a danger of that happening  Chequers doesn\u0027t prevail. It\u0027s a sharp departure from the words of his boss Theresa May - who has bluntly claimed there isn\u0027t going to be another vote. Mrs May\u0027s plan faces a make-or-break vote in Parliament in about two months\u0027 time, after it is finalised in negotiations between Britain and the EU.  The prospect of defeat is looking more likely for Mrs May after Labour signalled it would try and defeat her plan. Losing the vote would hurl Brexit into unprecedented crisis and could trigger a leadership contest or general election. Mr Stride was trying to explain how he thinks Brexiteer Tories will fall in line behind the PM - despite threats that 80, including ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis, will vote against Chequers.  But his words come just hours after second referendum campaigners published a blueprint on how it can take place well before Brexit Day in March 2019.  Lord Kerr, the peer who wrote Article 50 , said the UK\u0027s notice to leave can still be withdrawn and there would be no dficulty rewriting the timetable.    Mr Stride\u0027s comments were seized upon by campaigners for a second referendum - who include backbench MPs from all parties and London mayor Sadiq Khan .  Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, of the Best For Britain group, said: After weeks of denying the obvious, a senior minister has let the cat out of the bag. The government know that  their deal is voted down the only way out of this mess is a people\u0027s vote. Mel Stride is the first minister to admit a fresh referendum is possible and it is now clear that the public deserve a final say on the Brexit deal. Labour MP Alison McGovern, of the People’s Vote campaign, said: This has changed everything. A minister has had the courage to tell the truth about the mess the Government are in over Brexit. The UK\u0027s current Brexit plan is based on a deal Theresa May drew up at Chequers, her country retreat, in July 2018. At the time it was seen as a major sht to soft Brexit - prompting hard-Leaver Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027 is a bid to solve the biggest problem of Brexit - how to stop a hard border between Northern Ireland and either the EU, or the rest of the UK. It would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tarfs on the EU\u0027s behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers said this olive branch would useless in practice. They forced Theresa May to amend the plan to say the EU should collects tarfs on the UK\u0027s behalf. Mrs May insisted this didn\u0027t scupper her plan. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and has continued to suggest there will be a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Remainers and Labour have also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds.  With a November deadline to agree a deal with the EU looming, and the plan facing a vote in Parliament after that, the UK is now ramping up plans to leave in March 2019 with no deal."},{"url":null,"title":"filming north korea great no","story":"News\u0027Filming in North Korea was great, no one had heard of Monty Python and thought I was just some old bloke\u0027, says Michael PalinAround the world he is famous for being a member of the surreal comedy team Monty Python and his TV travelogues but when Michael Palin went to film in North Korea no-one had any idea who he wasShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMark JefferiesShowbiz Editor12:08, 19 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/tv/video/michael-palin-journeys-north-korea-13264794,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMichael Palin had only been in North Korea for a few hours when he was woken suddenly by an unusual sound. Already nervous about what lay ahead, he heard what he describes as “the worlds most unusual wake up call” - the entire city of Pyongyang drowned in a piece of music called \u0027Where Are You Dear General?\u0027 loudly repeated throughout the streets at regular intervals from the crack of dawn. “I first heard this at five o\u0027clock and it is like music that emanates from the whole city,” he explains. “It was eerie music which was quite menacing at five o\u0027clock and then became rather strange and you couldn\u0027t tell where it was coming from.  “It sounds vaguely Brian Eno. It’s not like music blaring and you would immediately say that is propaganda music. I did honestly think that something had gone in my head or a terrible dream I was going through. “Other cities you think of screaming sirens but there is none of that at all. This noise, you couldn\u0027t avoid it.” Palin, 75, was given two weeks to film the first in-depth Western documentary for many years about the country that is shrouded in secrecy. The country is famous for its missiles and propaganda, which explains why Michael says his we “uncharacteristically didn\u0027t want me to do this” but he was too intrigued to turn it down. Now safely back in England, Palin describes the trip as “the most revealing journey of my le”. And the surprises begin even before he sets foot in the North Korea as the TV screens on the train ride from South Korea across the bridge to get to his final destination show films of missiles and a smiling Kim Jong-un. From then on, everywhere he looked things were noticeably dferent from the western world. “There is no advertising and there is just one advert for a car that was built with South Korean support but apart from that everything else is propaganda,” Michael explains.  “So we had 14 days without Coca-cola, chewing gum, washing powder etc. “If you are at home in North Korea apart from in the lavatory and in the kitchen. There are pictures of the leaders everywhere and everyone has to wear a picture of the leader on their unorm unless they are at work. So it is absolutely total the omnipotent gaze of the leaders. But interesting enough  you are North Korean, and it has been going since 1945, they tend to ignore them. It is more provocative to you then it is to a North Korean.” Palin\u0027s trips to places like the North Pole and Himalayas have been seen by millions of viewers over the years around the globe. But unlike any of his other travelogues he has made over the years there were many restrictions in North Korea, which saw him accompanied everywhere by two guides Soo Yang and Chang Chu who talk to him on camera but also keep a watchful eye on what is being filmed. “The first day was a very tricky day,” admits Michael. “Because we were in front of the monuments of the two great leaders and there are ious rules there and the leaders have to be filmed in their entirety and so you have to stand a long way back so you can film the full  of them. Also there were ious ways that you had to behave and I did my first piece to camera and I was quite pleased and I thought, well I have said what I want to say and that is quite good and I look around and they  never directly confronted me but Neil our director came over for a chat and I said to Neil, \u0027did I say something wrong? What did I say? Did I mention something about the regime?. “And in the end they said no, no, no, You have got to do it again because you had your hand in your pocket and that is disrespectful, so that was interesting.” Palin\u0027s two part documentary begins with him taking a train from South Korea into the Northern country and the contrast between the high rise building and advertising billboards in the South and the stark space and propaganda posters in the North are as clear. But Palin insists he has gone “beyond the politics” and does get to speak and interact with some of the 25 million population. At a May Day celebration in the city of Moranbong hundreds of men and women are seen dancing and drinking rice wine in a park in the city centre.  One local even puts a garland made of green foliage on Michael\u0027s head. He said: There was no way that our minders could control everything that we saw and nor did they really try to. They were nearby by they let us film everything that was going on on that hill and next to the amusements and the parks on that particular day and I almost feel when you are filming a country, it’s not really the big statements or the big policies that you are hearing about that make the dference. To me, it’s the way that people move and the way people talk and the way that people eat. Decades of a rigid state-controlled system have led to stagnation and a leadership dependent on the cult of personality as well as isolation from the rest of the world. But despite this negative image, Palin said: “North Korea wasn’t what I expected and I had been conditioned by a general idea that this is a dark place. A grim place of repression and lack of freedom and I think when we were going there, I felt that this was going to somehow be reflected in the look of the place and the way that people behaved towards to me, but that just didn\u0027t happen. “I enjoyed finding out it wasn\u0027t a dreadfully threatening place and I enjoyed making friends with people and understand what it was all about. “Our stern minders weren\u0027t that stern in the end. I had my 75th birthday whilst I was there and at the end of the day they bought me with a birthday cake and a special party.  This huge birthday cake must have used up their agricultural output. I felt more relaxed as time went on I did at one time thing I would be fearful or lonely but I didn\u0027t feel that. “We talked a lot together and evaluated the day and I think we all had this feeling at the end that we didn\u0027t particularly want to leave. That was not just me that was all the crew. It had been embedded in me before I went out there that six days would be enough and I was going for two weeks. “I know we have been looked after very well and better than a lot of people in the country but there was this feeling that it hadn\u0027t been the monster and it was actually quite serene. “There were no traffic jams so it was nice to walk, no advertising which was quite odd, all they are selling really is the people united behind the leaders and even that isn\u0027t as heavy as I thought it would be. So my feeling was relief tempered with happiness.” "},{"url":null,"title":"muller light addict who eats","story":"NewsMuller Light addict who eats up to 24 yogurts a day \"devastated\" after Slimming World changes Syn valueNikki regularly eats between six and eight pots a day - but can get through four six-packs \"on a bad day\"Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola OakleyHead of Audience15:14, 19 SEP 2018NewsNikki has lost almost three stone on Slimming World despite getting through an alarming number of yogurts a day \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A Slimming World member who eats up to 24 Muller Lights a day has been left devastated after the weight loss organisation increased the yogurts\u0027 \u0027Syn\u0027 value .  Mum-of-four Nikki O\u0027Neill, 46, from Bournemouth, says she became addicted to the low-fat snacks - which were previously \u0027free\u0027 to eat on the diet plan - as they satisfied her sweet tooth. She munches her way through six or eight yogurts daily, but says on a bad day she can consume three or four multipacks. Slimming World announced on Monday that Muller Lights now have to be counted as 1 \u0027Syn\u0027 each, within a member\u0027s daily allowance of between five and 15.  If Nikki continued to eat her way through multipacks, she would now far exceed her maximum Syn allowance before counting any other treats. A plain vanilla Muller Light contains 99 calories per pot, meaning 24 would add up to an intake of 2376 calories in yogurts alone. Despite her addiction, Nikki, who works in a school as a kitchen assistant, has managed to lose a huge amount of weight on the plan.  She told : I\u0027m devastated by the news. I\u0027ve been doing Slimming World for five and a half months and I\u0027ve lost almost three stone. I never liked yogurts until I joined. I have a sweet tooth so I soon realised that this would be a great replacement for sugary snacks. Most people on Slimming World might have one or two low fat yogurts a day, but Nikki confesses she eats between six and eight Muller Lights daily. On a bad day I could easily get through three or four six-packs, she said. That adds up to between 18 and 24 yogurts in as many hours.  Nikki explained: I would usually have two for breakfast mixed in with oats, then a couple for lunch and dinner. The rest are in between meals - probably every half an hour when I am home in between my jobs. I have the fruit flavours in the morning and during the day. Then in the evening I love the orange or caramel ones with added chocolate bits. I\u0027m gutted, though, as they have just brought out banoffee flavour and I would have lived off these!  Nikki estimates she spends upwards of \u0026pound30 per week on the light desserts - and she panics  she doesn\u0027t have any in the fridge. Every night, pretty much, my husband will ask  we need anything from the shops and yogurts are always on the list, she said. The school worker is mum to Luke, nine, Holly, 10, Jack, 13 and 28-year-old Liam and says she is renowned for her addiction among her friends and family - who think it\u0027s hilarious. I was gutted when I heard they were to have Syns but I also found it so funny that friends and family tagged me in posts about it, she said.  I genuinely worry what I will have as my go-to sweet snack now. It\u0027s going to be a really hard habit to break, that\u0027s for sure. I will have to savour each one instead of having four or five in a row! When asked  she\u0027s tempted to carry on eating the yogurts excessively, given how much weight she\u0027s lost, Nikki had a logical answer. To be honest,  I cut down to, say, six a day, that will probably make a big dference to my weight loss. A Slimming World spokesperson said: “We routinely review our guidance for all food products to ensure it includes the most up to date information and advice, and incorporates feedback from our members and Consultants.

Radley, thought to be a border terrier cross, was found by a member of the public in the early hours of Monday morning in west London. The stressed and frightened pup was discovered with an elasticated hairband tied around his legs which was cutting off his circulation and damaging his paws. There was also an unopened tin of dog food in the handbag, which had a note stuck on the outside that said: Found this puppy.  Radley is said to be in fairly good body condition but has had diarrhoea so he is being closely monitored. The RSPCA\u0027s Inspector Phil Norman is now investigating how the pooch came to be dumped in the handbag. He said: We received a call from a woman who’d found a little puppy in a red handbag fastened to the door handle of a charity shop in The Broadway, Greenford. “It was around 2am on Monday morning. “Poor little Radley must have been very stressed and frightened being stuffed into that handbag and abandoned in the middle of the night.  The pup was taken to the RSPCA\u0027s Putney Animal Hospital, in south-west London. Inspector Norman has spoken to the local shops and is gathering CCTV in order to trace whoever is responsible for abandoning the pup. He’s also seeking any witnesses who may have seen anything suspicious in the area at the time or who recognise Radley to get in touch by calling the charity’s appeal line on 0300 123 8018.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study found one fth of consumers wrongly believe frozen fruits and vegetables contain fewer nutrients than their fresh counterparts. Another one in 12 mistakenly think frozen food doesn’t last as long as a fresh product while another one in ten reckon frozen food is more expensive. And two fths are of the opinion frozen foods are filled with preservatives to give them a longer shelf-le. Others myths surrounding frozen meals are that you can\u0027t safely cook them from frozen, with four in 10 believing you aren’t supposed to heat food from frozen.  Following a study of 2,000 adults by Birds Eye, dietitian and health writer, Laura Tilt said: “Many, but not all, foods can be cooked from frozen. \u0027\u0027Examples include chicken breasts, mince, pizza, fruit and vegetables, fish and ready meals. “The best advice is to check the packet of the food for specic cooking and heating instructions.” The study also found nearly two thirds don’t think that all types of food can be frozen, but experts revealed the opposite is true. The truth is that only a few foods aren’t ideal for freezing, such as eggs, both raw and cooked, or vegetables with a high water content as they tend to go mushy upon defrosting. Around one in four believe you can refreeze food once it\u0027s thawed without cooking it first, which is also false because you can refreeze it but must cook between thawing and refreezing.  Furthermore, 12 per cent weren\u0027t aware frozen food can be part of a health diet. Others - 38 per cent - believe you can’t keep frozen food past it’s expiry date when in fact you can, although its quality will deteriorate. Finally 41 per cent believe it\u0027s dangerous to defrost certain types of food on the counter, when in reality but it should, ideally, be defrosted in the fridge to prevent it entering the danger zone of five to 63 degrees. The study also found that, as a nation, we get through 300 million frozen food items a week, from frozen fruit and veg to frozen fish. And six in 10 said there are certain foods they would prefer to buy frozen, including peas, fish fingers and fish fillets. It also emerged peas come out on top as the most regularly consumed frozen food, ahead of chips and even ice cream.

Emma, 38, says she wants her son to enjoy days of \u0027fun and freedom\u0027 and \u0027playing in the wild\u0027, Hull Live reports . Stanley is a June baby and so is one of the youngest in the school year. He does not have any additional needs, but his parents believe it is in his best interests to start school next year, once he is five and at compulsory school age .  In her blog, Dirt, Diggers and Dinosaurs , his mum explains her reasons for holding him back by applying to defer his admission to school for a year. She starts by saying: We’ve done something that many of our friends and family will view as controversial. We have decided not to send Stanley to school this year. Instead, he will be starting next September when he is five. For the extra year he will be attending preschool part time, playing, bonding with his brothers, playing, exploring, enjoying days out, playing, growing and developing at his own pace. She then answers some of the questions she says she\u0027s been asked.  No, Stanley does not have any special educational needs. No, we haven’t ‘held him back’ because he was struggling at preschool. No, it’s not that we can’t bear to let him go, and I want to keep him a baby. No, we aren’t doing it for ourselves and not thinking about what’s best for him. No, we’ve not thrown our dummy out because he didn’t a place at our first choice of school this year... he did. No, we’ve not done what’s easiest for us.   As you can probably tell from the answers above, I’ve had a bit of an ear bashing by some which I hope is mostly fuelled by misinformation and misunderstanding, she says. Explaining her decision, she said: The plain fact is, he’s four. We’ve simply chosen not to send him to school early, we are sending him at school age which  you go back a generation was the absolute norm. I personally believe that in the UK all children start school too early and that we’d be better off following our European neighbours whose children start school at aged seven when they are emotionally and physically ready.  We were recently informed at a preschool parents evening that Stanley  would soon cope with starting school, as he’s really bright. This really hit home for me, a four year old shouldn’t have to cope with anything. Emma, from Hull, Yorkshire, who is expecting another baby, says she decided to write the blog to let other parents know it is possible to prevent your child from starting school at the age of four, as she believes it\u0027s not widely known. This year three set of parents have successfully applied to Hull City Council to defer their child\u0027s entry to school. Emma said: I’ve had two relative strangers - who I only know through ious kids clubs - tell me that they think it’s amazing, and one who asked me to email her the info so she could then look into it for her daughter. She had no idea that the option was available, which I think is a massive issue. Thanks to a change in DfE legislation, we not only have the choice whether to start his school journey prior to CSA or at CSA but also have the right to request admission into Reception class at CSA rather than Year One, ensuring that he will not lose a vital whole year of early education. I think an extra year of being a child with no responsibility or pressure can only be a good thing. When I read articles about phonics tests in Year one ages five and six and SATS at ages six and seven it makes me so sad. When did being a child become so target driven? Aren’t we told by midwives and health visitors that ‘they all learn at their own pace?\u0027 Why does this suddenly change when they enter the school system? The extra year at home will be an extra year of developing emotionally and at his own pace. An extra year of learning through play, exploration and love.  A controversial decision which is a big \u0027gamble\u0027 Emma said she 100 per cent believes she has made the right decision for Stanley, but admits there is a big gamble involved. She said: The BIG gamble in all of this and the only thing that regularly niggles at me is whether we will get offered our first choice school again in the next round of admissions. If we don’t, then will our offered school be happy to support a CSA Reception start, or will they be championing Year 1? The LEA and school would have to provide evidence that missing a whole year of education would be in his best interests. I guess we’ll just have to face any obstacles, and fight the battles as we get to them. However Emma signs the blog post off by saying as she sits there writing the post and watching Stanley performing a puppet show for his brother using three toy dinosaurs, she knows with all certainty that this is the best thing for her child.

But Domestos believes that a clean and safe toilet should be within everyone’s reach so it is helping to answer the public’s prayers. Its Use Our Loos campaign, launched earlier this month, is inviting businesses across Britain to sign up, open their cubicles and welcome everyone - customers and non-customers - to use their loos. And they’ve also agreed to feature on the Great British Public Toilet Map – a free interactive street map developed by Domestos and Public Convenience. The map - the UK’s largest database of publicly-accessible toilets - includes lavs that are located in local businesses as well as those at bus and train stations, shopping centres, libraries, leisure centres and hotels.  And it’s compiled using information from councils, the businesses themselves and YOU! As well as using the map to discover nearby loos, the public can help improve the service by adding new locations or flagging loos that have closed. Anyone can go on the website and add or edit the correct information about the toilet such as who can access it, opening hours, or facilities available. Just click on the Great British Toilet Map image below to reveal the map and find your nearest available toilet...   By visiting toiletmap.org.uk on a computer of smartphone, your device will automatically find your location and reveal your nearest available toilets. Users can also look for loos before leaving their home or office by typing in a postcode to search other areas.  As well as pinpointing the exact location of nearby public toilets, helpful information is featured about each one including whether there’s a charge and  it has an attendant. There is also a tool which lets users set preferences to highlight any specic needs they might have, such as whether it has disabled access and baby changing facilities, and what the opening hours are.

Mike North, 36, says he and his we Lucy, 37, were denied a free pass for 11-year-old Isabelle because they live within three miles of her school. But Mr North claims he carried out his own survey and found that his home in Swanland, East Yorkshire, is 3.021 miles from South Hunsley School in Melton.  East Riding Council wouldn\u0027t budge, however, and the Norths have been left scrambling to get their three children to two schools so Isabelle doesn\u0027t have to walk three miles along dangerous roads, Hull Live reports.   The council said it only awards free bus passes based on distances calculated by its own “geographic information system  mapping system,” which showed the distance to be less than three miles. Mr North said: “It’s an hour’s walk there and an hour’s walk back which the council are expecting her to do. We won’t let her do it because it’s a long way and she would have to set off early to get to school and for an 11-year-old it’s just not safe. “She would have to walk down dangerous roads, some of which have no street lights or footpaths, and in the winter it will be dark.”  Isabelle started at South Hunsley two weeks ago and since then, the Norths have had to juggle trying to take her and their six-year-old twins to their two schools in the morning and picking them up in the afternoons. When Isabelle has used the bus it has cost her \u0026pound4 a day – a figure which the Norths say they cannot continue to afford to pay. Mr North says not having the free bus pass has caused his eldest child a great deal of upheaval during the first two weeks at her new school. He said: “It has been a bit stressful for her. She was already worried about going to secondary school and the situation with the bus pass has made things worse.  “A lot of her friends are on the bus and being driven to school by your parents isn’t the coolest thing, especially when you’re starting at a new school. “When I started secondary school I remember that everything was new and it was like a whole new world. Isabelle doesn’t need the added stress of not being able to get on the bus with her friends.” Mr North has been offered the chance to buy an annual bus pass for Isabelle for \u0026pound520 and although he is livid at not being given a free one, he feels he may have to bite the bullet and pay the price. However, he believes the council is compromising his daughter’s safety by not giving her the free bus pass.

Lindsey Coubray, aged 19, suffers from aquagenic urticaria, which affects just one in 230 million people worldwide. She breaks out in severely itchy hives whenever she comes into contact with water - stopping her from showering or swimming. Lindsey suffers excruciating pain  she is caught out in a rain shower and the reaction is even triggered by her own sweat and tears. The office worker said: “People often wonder how I can be allergic to something that makes up 70 per cent of my body.  “There is often a sense of disbelief, followed by questioning how this is even possible. “Whenever I have a shower, as well as sneezing, I am covered from head to toe in an itchy rash which looks and feels like a nettle rash, my nose burns and my eyes become bloodshot and swollen. “Warm weather is a particular challenge because I get hot, sweat and then end up with an intensely itchy rash all over my back, arms, head and chest. “If I get caught out in the rain, my skin gets very itchy and feels like it’s burning.” Lindsey, who had always sneezed while washing herself, was diagnosed two years ago after her symptoms worsened.  She has to take strong antihistamines and asthma medication before taking a shower. She also relies on drinking milk because water leaves her feeling nauseous and creates mouth sores. Lindsey, of Wheathamsted, Herts., is so senstive that even humidity can leave her struggling to breathe. She said: “Sometimes,  it has just stopped raining and I go outside, I can find myself feeling breathless.”  Lindsey is hoping to raise awareness of the condition and has set up an Instagram account ‘aquagenic.urticaria’ to try and help other sufferers.

Within days of her announcing her first solo royal project, the book is a bestseller on Amazon as people rush to pre-order Together: Our Community Cookbook .  As well as promoting the fundraiser with a sweet video, she\u0027s written a very personal three-page foreword for the book. She speaks about her experiences meeting the women at the Hubb Community Kitchen and why she believes food is so important. And her writing includes a subtle sign that the Duchess of Sussex is fully embracing her new le in Britain.  As she was born in LA and split her working le between the US and Canada, we assume she uses American English. However in the foreword she uses the English spellings of words. She writes organisations instead of the American organizations and adds a U to favourite.  Together showcases 50 recipes from the women who run the Hubb Community Kitchen near Grenfell Tower. They set it up to cook for people whose lives had been completely torn apart by the horric tragedy last year. After discovering they could only open two days a week because of limited funding during secret visits to the site, she suggested creating a cookbook to raise money.

Jason has been dressing up as his alter-ego \u0027Suzan Bee Anthony\u0027 for over two years after first becoming inspired at Pride. His parents, Victoria, 40 and Greg, 34 have been nothing but supportive towards their son after he announced that he wanted to perform in drag. The 11-year-old\u0027s mum has been told by other aspiring drag queens or gay men who say that they wish they could have \u0027come out\u0027 in their younger le. She said: Jason tends to be a little shy but then it\u0027s like flipping a switch to Suzan Bee, he has more confidence and is very sassy. Seeing the change in him and how happy he is, makes my heart burst with happiness.  It\u0027s so exciting seeing him perform, he can get up there and do what he does. It makes us feel happy as a family watching him strut his stuff. I just want my kids to be happy and do what makes them feel complete, I feel that drag does that for Jason. I couldn\u0027t care less about what people think of me, I know some people are closed minded to gay and drag culture, but generally, people are supportive. Two years ago, a lady came up to me and said, \u0027your daughter is so pretty,\u0027 when I told her he was my son she said, \u0027oh my god, that\u0027s even better.\u0027 Jason is not the son I expected to have, I expected him to like trucks and getting dirty working on cars, but my son basically strutted out the womb. To me, he is perfect the way he is. The mum-of-three added: Seeing him out there and like, \u0027This is me, this is who I am\u0027 is fantastic and makes me so proud.  Young gay people and drag queens come up to us and say they wish they could have \u0027came out\u0027 in their younger le like Jason. Victoria, who works as a preschool teacher, said that Jason has had a fascination with dressing up in girl\u0027s clothes and make-up since he was just three. Since starting drag Suzan Bee, who has a wardrobe full of sequinned outfits, has performed for projects to raise funds for the Aids Foundation and at multiple Pride events from Oklahoma City to Montreal.

Jake Parr, 30, was exploring an underground bunker in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and was taking photographs of his experience.  However, looking back at the photographs, Jake was shocked to find the pictures appeared haunted .  Alongside seeing the face of \u0027Uncle Fester\u0027 in one of the bunker\u0027s doors, Jake also claims he could see the face of a little girl at the bottom of the stairs.  Despite being scared by the experience, Jake plans to  to the underground bunker to see what other paranormal experiences he can encounter. Jake, from Stockport, said: When I was down there, it felt really creepy and almost as though someone was following us. But it wasn\u0027t until I looked back at the photographs that I realised how creepy it really was. I was shocked when I looked at the photographs of the ghost in the door, it looked like Uncle Fester, it was definitely an old bald man.  Then I was even more surprised when I looked through the rest of the photographs and saw the ghost of the little girl on the stairs. It now all makes sense as to why it felt so creepy down there, it has to be haunted. Despite having explored a number of supposedly haunted venues, Jake claims that this was one of the creepiest he had visited to date. He said: This was one of the creepiest things I have ever come across on one of my explorations.

Laura Weiser, 28, purchased a Disney princess face mask from Primark last week, planning a relaxation session. On Saturday, after an exhausting day redecorating the front room of her house with husband Alan, Laura decided to have a soak in the bath before heading to bed, wearing the \u0026pound3 Princess Jasmine face mask. But when her husband clapped eyes on her he burst out laughing, prompting her to clamber out of bed and take a selfie to see what all the fuss was about. Laura, a full-time mum, was shocked when she realised she looked less Disney princess and more like Leatherface from 1974 horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Laura, from Oxford, said: It looks beautul before you put it on, but when it\u0027s on it\u0027s a really scary-looking face - it\u0027s absolutely terrying. I knew as soon as my husband saw me that something was up, he was just sat next to me in bed in stitches. That\u0027s never a good sign. I remember thinking to myself \u0027it can\u0027t be that bad\u0027 so I got up and took a picture. But yes, it really was. It\u0027s quite an unusual look with big eyes printed on it, I\u0027ve never had a sheet mask where the eyes are covered up before, I guess it\u0027s to give you the full effect. It reminded me of the character Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Self-professed Disney fan Laura who lives with Alan and their four children Bonnie, 10, Nigel, 8, Dennis, 5, and Lincolnr, 2, snapped up the cucumber sheet face mask from the Oxford branch of the chain a fortnight ago. When the mum-of-four opened the packaging to the \u0027A Whole New World\u0027 face mask she was thrilled to see the outline of Princess Jasmine\u0027s face sporting her signature cat-eye make-up, scarlet lips and gold earrings. However when the mask went on it distorted the hugely popular character\u0027s features leaving friends and family in stitches at her bizarre look. Pals posting on social media compared her to the murderous Leatherface - who wears masks made of his victims\u0027 skin. Laura said: My daughter Bonnie found it hilarious but I took it off after 15 minutes as I was worried about the younger kids walking in and seeing me,  they had they would have probably cried. It looked atrocious, it was the most bizarre thing ever, but a really good novelty. Alan looked over at me and burst out laughing. The mouth didn\u0027t line up, so it looked like I had two mouths and it was just really scary, but also funny.  I sent a picture to my mother-in-law and sister-in-law and they sent messages back with lots of laughing emojis. Laura said that although the face mask was the cause of a few laughs, she couldn\u0027t fault the quality of the product which left her skin feeling refreshed. Laura said: Despite looking so terrying, the product itself was amazing, I had lovely skin afterwards and my face was very moisturised.

Traditional nanny duties include preparing meals or doing the school run and generally taking care of the kids .  But today it appears some nannies are doing a lot more than just that. While some are expected to teach children a new language and change nappies, there are others who are now paid to also look after the adults of the family.   According to an article in The New York Post this week, there\u0027s currently a fleet of super nannies in New York City who are tasked with giving their boss a massage and even blow drying their hair.  Limor Weinstein, who owns a nanny-consulting business in Manhattan, spilled the beans on some of her elite clients. She revealed that one family, with children aged four and seven, requested a yoga certied nanny, to make sure everybody in the household was balanced and mindful.   The nanny gives the whole family yoga lessons, even driving to the father\u0027s office while the children are at school for a 30 minute session.  Similarly, Erin Maloney-Winder, president of a household staffing company in Manhattan, revealed that she recently was asked by a CEO and mother-of-four to find a caregiver to blow out her hair everyday, in addition to caring for the two girls\u0027 hair, driving them to school and preparing three meals a day.  If that weren\u0027t enough, the nanny also gives the mum facials and manicures as well. Another wealthy parent, Jeff Goldstein, gets his children\u0027s nanny to massage him and his we for 90 minutes twice a week once the kids are tucked up in bed.  In the UK one of the most hardworking nannies has to be Maria Borrallo , royal nanny to Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.

CCTV, released by police, shows the deeply distressing last few moments 25-year-old Inna Petrova has with her tiny child, clutching her tightly, before she hands her over. The unemployed painter at one point can be seen turning her back on Natalia Zhdanova who has flown 1,970 miles from St Petersburg to Omsk collect the baby. But then Inna kisses her little one for the last time and hands over the child, who is cocooned in a bright pink wrap. Natalia then used a faked birth certicate - which listed the baby as hers - to show airport security before flying back to her home city with the child, police say.  Inna - who later said she was “hysterical” at giving away her child - is seen wiping tears from her eyes on the video, released by the Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes in Russia. She now admits she was wrong and says she wishes she could wind back the clock. Ahead of the child\u0027s birth, Natalia had sent Inna a payment of 3,000 roubles - just \u0026pound34. Natalia, a 43-year-old teacher, is said to have empty nest syndrome now her after her adult son left home, and wanted one last baby. She already bringing up another adopted daughter. Now both women have been formally detained as a criminal probe is launched under Russia’s child trafficking laws. They could each face up to ten years in jail.  Investigators say that Natalia posted an online advertisement saying: “Hi everyone! My husband and I would very much like to get a baby aged 0 to 3 months. All the documents for adoption are ready. Please send a private message for details. Girls, darlings, please help.” Inna - at the time pregnant after a short relationship with a man she met at a local cafe - replied: “Hello, I would like my daughter to be adopted. Please do so, I am not able to raise her, no chance”. She told police she lived with her mother and sister in a cramped apartment and they were furious when she became pregnant. They were adamant she should not keep the baby. Omsk prosecutor Vasily Gumenyuk said: “During our interrogation, the biological mother of the baby explained that she lived in a rented apartment with her mother and sister. “Both were strongly against the baby and put strong psychological pressure on the future mother.  “The young woman failed to get a job, and she was not married to the father of her baby. “He knew about her pregnancy but did not plan to support her. “She decided to give away the baby to the teacher from St Petersburg.” The baby deal would have remained secret but for Inna and her mother telling their landlady - who immediately informed police. Officers knocked on Natalie’s door in St Petersburg one week after the airport exchange. Inna said: “All the way through my pregnancy, my mother and sister were attacking me. “They wanted me to have an abortion. “My mother threatened me, saying ‘If you give birth, just don’t come back home, I won’t let you in!’” She said: “They told me a baby is not a toy.” “I posted in my social network that I needed help and Natalia Zhdanova replied.” She admitted she could have given the child up at her maternity hospital but chose not to and instead to hand the baby to Natalia who she had not previously met.  She was paid 3,000 roubles - sent in advance allegedly to cover the cost of nappies - but claimed Natalia also promised to help her and her family find jobs in St Petersburg. Asked about the moment she handed over the child, she said: “Of course it was hard. “I was in hysterics in the airport when it happened. “But Natalia’s  flight has already been announced, I had to give her my daughter so  could catch their plane. “My daughter was nine days old. I would have given her away earlier but we stayed in the hospital for a week, and then we lived at home for several days, but it was just impossible to be there because of constant scandals.” She said: “When the story became known, a friend of my mother said that she would have helped us.

Cyril Moreau and Dominique Jacovides, of the Bestimage agency in Paris, were accused of snapping Catherine Middleton and her husband, Prince William, on a private holiday in the South of France.  The lensmen have always insisted they are innocent – pointing to a complete lack of evidence in a case that saw the Royal couple win \u0026pound92,000 in compensation .  This is far more than is usually awarded in such privacy cases in France, leading to an appeal by French Closer Magazine, which published the snaps in 2012.  Moreau and Jacovides appealed sentences handed down in September 2017, but on Wednesday the Versailles Appeal Court, west of Paris, uphold them all. Prosecutor Marc Brisset-Foucault told the court: ‘There was an absolutely unacceptable breach, not only of the privacy and the private lives of these two iniduals, but also of the dignity of a woman.’ Long-lens cameras caught Kate solely wearing a pair of bikini bottoms, with William at one stage rubbing sun cream into his we’s skin.  At the time, the couple were relaxing at a Provence chateau owned by the Earl of Snowdon, the late Princess Margaret’s son.  The editor of Closer magazine , Laurence Piea, 52, and Ernest Mauria, the 72-year-old director of the Mondadori group which publishes it, were fined \u0026pound42,000 each.  The photographers were also fined the equivalent of up to \u0026pound8,500 each, after Prince William presented statements attacking the paparazzi.

The mum first extends her trunk tenderly over her son\u0027s chest before moving to check to see  he is breathing through its trunk. Elephants are known to show signs of emotions such as anger, joy and grief and are among of the most intelligent animals on the earth. This delicate moment between mother and son were filmed in Thailand. The species is under threat across the world, largely due to poaching for ivory. Large numbers of elephants were lost during the 20th century as they were killed for their tusks and as humans competed for resources.  Climate change is also playing a part in destroying the chances for elephant survival, as their environment will become drier and hotter. Leslie A. Temanson, a former programme director at Volunteer in Thailand with Friends for Asia, filmed the clip. He said, Moms are moms, no matter the species. This mother elephant showed me as she tenderly checked her sleeping calf, much as a human mom might do her napping baby.

Civilians described gang rapes on an industrial scale, toddlers being swung against tree trunks until they were dead and families barricaded in their homes to be burned alive. When a mother fled from one inferno carrying a small baby she was shot and the child crushed to death by a soldier, an eye-witness said. The testimony was gathered from 100 people who survived an offensive in Unity State, in the northern Greater Upper Nile region of the country, between April and July this year. Government troops are accused of giving free rein to youth militias, unleashing a wave of systematic slaughter. The epicentre of the violence was Mayendit and Leer counties, areas held by the opposition.  Witnesses described civilians being slaughtered in their villages. Some were burned alive in their tukuls - traditional mud huts which often have a thatched roof. A man believed to be over 90 had his throat slit. Nyaweke, a 20-year-old woman, said she saw soldiers shoot dead her father and kill a number of children in Thonyoor, in Leer There were seven men [soldiers] who collected the children and put them into a tukul and they set the tukul on fire. I could hear the screaming. They were four boys. One boy tried to come out and the soldiers closed the door on him. There were also five boys whom they hit against the tree, swinging them. They were two [or] three years old. They don’t want especially boys to live because they know they will grow up to become soldiers. In a separate incident in Rukway village, also in Leer, a couple and their two grandsons were burned alive in a house. Their daughter attempted to flee with her baby but she was shot and her child stamped to death. Even those who fled their villages had little chance of survival. Soldiers used amphibious vehicles to hunt those who had fled into swamps.  Nyalony, an elderly woman, told Amnesty she witnessed soldiers killing her husband and two other men: When the attack started, early in the morning while we were sleeping, my husband and I ran to the swamp together. Later in the morning, after the fighting was over, the soldiers came into the swamp looking for people, and sprayed the area where we were hiding with bullets. My husband was hit he cried out in pain. He was still alive, though, and the soldiers caught him, and then they shot him again and killed him. He was unarmed and wasn’t a fighter just a farmer.” Survivors faced unspeakable horror. Women and young girls said that they were abducted before being gang raped, sometimes for many weeks. Others were used as slaves to cook and clean for their captors. A 60-year-old man found his niece after she had been sexually assaulted by five men. She was just 13. My brother’s daughter was raped and she was going to die, he said. When they raped her, we came and found her and she was crying and bleeding … she couldn’t hide … she told me she was raped by five men. We could not carry her and she could not walk. There were also reports of sexual mutilation and castration.  Nyatap, who is around 32, gave a graphic account of her ordeal. Eight months pregnant, she was abducted with her five-year-old son and daughter, seven. There were 20 soldiers, she said. The other women who are not pregnant were raped. There was another lady... she was three months\u0027 pregnant and she miscarried. She was raped by 10 men. I saw it happen. They were just raping her under another tree. They put us in one compound.... there were other ladies... They would take turns raping them. Soldiers accused of carrying out the slaughter are also said to have looted and burned on a vast scale, making it virtually impossible for survivors who had fled to  to their homes. Amnesty claims that the situation was enabled by South Sudan\u0027s government failing to prosecute suspected war criminals for previous massacres in 2016. Four people had been identied but no action had been taken. Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East Africa, said: “A key factor in this brutal offensive was the failure to bring to justice those responsible for previous waves of violence targeting civilians in the region. “Leer and Mayendit counties have been hard hit in the past, and yet the South Sudanese government continues to give suspected perpetrators free rein to commit fresh atrocities. The result has been catastrophic for civilians.” Amnesty has called for immediate end to all human rights abuses. Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser, said: “It’s impossible to ignore the cruel reality –  the South Sudanese authorities had acted on our warnings back in 2016, this latest wave of violence against civilians in Leer and Mayendit might have been avoided. The only way to break this vicious cycle of violence is to end the impunity enjoyed by South Sudanese fighters on all sides. The government must ensure that civilians are protected and that those responsible for such heinous crimes are held to account.

I don’t want to criticise the referee but, according to me, it was a very soft penalty.“I asked my players  there was contact there but they didn’t think it was one which you have to give.”Of United’s display, Csaba added: “I think for 90 minutes plus added time we played one-way football.“The boys tried hard and it’s not easy when the clock is ticking down and you still can’t score.“In the first-half we had two very good chances where we should score and in the second half we were pressing Morton.“They were, more or less, 11 behind the ball playing very deep and they tried to counter attack.“Sometimes you have these games where you have to suffer but we have to be more clinical, must be more clinical.“We can talk about the many mistakes but we have to play faster, more with the ball into feet and up front but I think on Saturday everybody showed spirit.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba0ce600a7e5.jpg ","title":"new boy rachid bouhenna says dundee united have to work to win back supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Rachid Bouhenna insists they must repay the fans for their support with a win at Falkirk on Saturday.The French-Algerian centre-back made his United debut in their disappointing 1-1 draw with Morton at Tannadice at the weekend.The Terrors now travel west for a crucial Championship tie after captain Fraser Fyvie, ing from a long-term injury off the bench, salvaged a point with a last-minute strike against Jonatan Johansson’s side – who took an early lead through a Michael Tidser penalty.And Bouhenna says they will do everything they can to pick up three points and get the Arabs back onside ahead of, what he insists is, a continued promotion push.“Of course for Dundee United the objective is to go to the top league, the Premiership, so we have to win these games at home and get results away,” he said.“Saturday we lost two points, we need to win the supporters back this weekend at Falkirk and I hope next year we will play in the top tier.“The fans were amazing, we need them for the rest of the season and I think they are behind us.“After the game I thought it was a good game but we had many chances to score and didn’t take them.“It’s good to come back to draw but for the next game we have to win  we want to stay near the top of the Championship.”Despite hauling down Gregor Buchanan for the penalty which Tidser converted to give the Ton the lead on 11 minutes, Bouhenna was pleased with his first run-out in tangerine.However, The 27-year-old was not happy with referee Colin Steven’s call to award the spot-kick after the tussle with Buchanan at a corner and Bouhenna expressed his surprise given the physical nature of Scottish football.He added: “It was an OK debut I think.“Only really the foul for the penalty – I can’t believe it.“I don’t think it was, he did not have the ball and we are in a duel but I don’t know why.“It was not just the penalty, it was every ball the referee whistle against us.“It is not like Algeria or France, for sure.“It is more physical but Morton was a very physical game – that is the big dference and I think we can play more football at home.“Away it will be very dficult, you saw in the last game at Alloa you can’t play because of a dficult pitch but at home we have to play more.“Next game it will be very dficult when we play against Falkirk, so we have to get used to this.”Bouhenna is still settling into le in Dundee and getting to grips with the language – not to mention the accent.However, he still feels at home after being welcomed by everyone at the club.Skipper Fyvie, in particular, impressed the big defender with his influence on the side when he entered the fray on 73 minutes.The 25-year-old changed the game and got the equaliser with a ferocious half volley in second-half stoppage time.“Fraser has the experience, when he come on to pitch he helped us.“He is good for us and I hope in the next game he can continue to help us  he is in the starting XI or comes on to the pitch.“I am enjoying being at Dundee United, I am feeling very good.“My team-mates and everybody at the club have been very nice, they feel like family and I am very happy with it.“With the manager and the team-mates it is very good but we have to keep going, keep working and think about the next game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b769ff279716.jpg ","title":"storm ali expected reopening time for tay road bridge revealed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere are unconfirmed reports of a reopening time for the Tay Road Bridge. 100vw, 3000px\" /The bridge has been closed for most of the afternoon as Storm Ali produced gusts as high as 102mph.Councillors Will Dawson and Christina Roberts wrote on Facebook at 3.25pm: \u0026#8220Folks, Just to say the Tay Road Bridge just recorded a wind speed of 102 MPH and remains closed.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 5:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117524.jpg","title":"Black Isle riders go the distance","story":"\u0026nbspPLANS to develop top-notch all-weather sports facilities in a Black Isle village took a step forward last week when 25 riders saddled up in Avoch for a 50-mile ride around the peninsula.The Vuelta de Isla Negra \u0026mdash translated as cycle around the Black Isle \u0026mdash was inspired by a Spanish event which takes place at the same time and saw members of the business community team up to chase a \u0026pound300,000 fundraising target for the facilities in Avoch.Law firm Ledingham Chalmers, which has offices in Inverness, Aberdeen, Stirling and Edinburgh, staged the event on Friday in support of Avoch Amenities Association\u0027 bid to transform an old bowling green into tennis and all-weather multi-sports courts with changing facilities.Senior associate Roddy Cormack came up with the idea for the event last year.

It has been handed in to the council.A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBTI forum, which is organising the rally, said Mr Morrison was entitled to his opinions,\"I have no problem with him or the people who have signed the petition holding their views and I totally respect that but there are a lot of other people who don\u0026rsquot hold those views,\" she said.\"You will always get people who don\u0026rsquot like LGBT stuff.\"Referring to his comments about people frolicking on rainbow-coloured floats, she said: \"Basically this is a celebration and  he doesn\u0026rsquot like people dancing and enjoying themselves, I could see that would be a problem for him.\"She said there was nothing illegal about the proposed parade.\"Obviously, nothing untoward will be happening during the march,\" she said. \"It will be totally family-friendly.\"He has a moral objection which is his personal objection and he is perfectly entitled to that.

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 5:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

season.That means Shinnie would be free to talk to any interested clubs when the winter transfer window opens on January 1.Dons boss Derek McInnes is desperate to tie down his captain long term.The Reds have tabled a contract to make Shinnie one of the highest-paid players at the club.McInnes planned to sit down with Shinnie and his agent after the transfer window closed on August 31 to thrash out a deal.However, talks were put on ice as the Reds skipper was recently away on international duty with Scotland.Those negotiations will now resume this week.On contract talks with Shinnie, McInnes said: “We will pick up on that this week.“Graeme has been away and didn’t come back until Thursday.”Signed from Inverness Caley Thistle on a two-year deal in 2015, Aberdonian Shinnie penned a contract extension in January 2017 until summer 2019.Championship Bristol City were understood to be monitoring Shinnie during the summer.Winger Gary Mackay-Steven is also out of contract at the end of the season and recently confirmed he has had no talks with Aberdeen regarding a possible new contract.It is understood the Dons are keen to secure Mackay-Steven on a new deal.Shinnie made his international breakthrough when earning his debut cap as a substitute in the 2-0 friendly loss to Peru in Lima this summer.He started the next game of the two-match South American trip as the Scots went down 1-0 to Mexico.Scotland boss Alex McLeish retained Shinnie in his squad for the recent Hampden games against Belgium and Albania.The Aberdonian came off the bench in the 4-0 friendly loss to World Cup semi-finalists Belgium to secure a third cap.He was an unused substitute in the 2-0 UEFA Nations League Group C1 win over Albania.McInnes said: “It is great to see Graeme involved with the Scotland squad.“He came bouncing through the door after coming back from international duty.“Although he didn’t play against Albania, which was a brilliant result, he was involved in the training and preparation for that. And he came on against Belgium.“All those little bits of experience being away with the Scotland squad can only help in the future for Graeme.“For me he has taken a big step forward from the games in the close season when they went to Peru and Mexico.“What he’s done now is let the manager know his abilities.“If Graeme keeps up his level of performance for us I am hopeful, and I am sure, he will be involved in future Scotland squads.“We are hoping he can be at the heart of that over the next period of time.“Sometimes you have to wait for starts but I have no doubt he is good enough to go on and do that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"win tickets for you and three friends for this years inverurie beer festival","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere\u0026#8217s less than two weeks left until Inverurie’s very own festival of great beer, cider, gin, prosecco and rum kicks off.This year\u0026#8217s event, which runs on September 28 and 29, will also feature mouth-watering street food from Screaming Peacock and some incredible southern American style grub from Thainstone events.Along side the massive array of food and drink, the event will also feature live music performances, with The Snuts, who recently played TRSNMT and Reading and Leeds, set to headline on Friday night.To celebrate this year\u0026#8217s event, we\u0026#8217ve teamed up with the guys at Inverurie Beer Festival to giveaway four tickets to to one very lucky winner.For a chance to win this superb prize simply enter using the form below.We\u0026#8217ll pick the winner on Tuesday, but will leave the tough task of picking your three friends to take along down to you.The Inverurie Beer Festival runs over three sessions, Friday 6.30pm – midnight, Saturday noon – 5.30pm and Saturday 6.30pm – midnight.All tickets include a festival programme, festival cup, a drink token and are available to purchase on the festival\u0026#8217s website www.inveruriebeerfestival\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5ba0973c62722-705x564.jpg ","title":"daily lives explored as aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year long portrait project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of portraits of north-east residents have formed part of a year-long photography project.Chris Henderson, a wedding and portrait photographer, has been photographing a person a day for the past year as part of a fun Instagram project.Every picture taken for Aberdeen photographer\u0026#8217s Instagram portrait project\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/every-picture-taken-for-aberdeen-photographers-instagram-portrait-project/embed/#?secret=ej47imVawl\" data-secret=\"ej47imVawl\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Every picture taken for Aberdeen photographer\u0026#8217s Instagram portrait project\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"The rules were simple – to shoot, edit and upload a portrait photo every day, to find a new subject every day with no repeats and no self-portraits being allowed.Uploaded on his Instagram account chrshndrsn, portraits involve a range of male and female subjects, and include a caption with information about how he met the person and some details about them or the conversation they had at the time.He began the project on September 13 2017, posting an image of fellow wedding photographer Calum Riddell. Chris, 33, of the city centre, who will finish the project this week, said: “Part of it was because of the nature of my work, it’s quite easy for me to spend an entire day without leaving the building.“It was partly because I wanted an excuse to leave the house and speak to another human being every day.“Beyond that, I didn’t really have any objectives.”Most of the people he met were in Aberdeen, and two thirds of the people who were photographed had volunteered to take part. He said: “There were a couple of times I had to chase people down the street saying ‘excuse me’.“I started off with friends and family and former colleagues, but people started coming to me.“The vast majority have been people who have approached me.“There’s no way I would have been able to do it myself just having to approach people in the street.“It ended up being a snowball effect.“The idea of doing a picture a day is not something I dreamed up, it’s something a lot of photographers do.” Working as a wedding photographer, Chris often has to work with a backdrop that is outwith his control, so the project allowed him to look at dferent technical aspects while fuelling his love for portrait photography.He said: “It ties in with my interests. I like taking pictures of people.“Taking a picture of a dferent person every day meant I couldn’t fall back on the same people every day. I’ve allowed myself a bit of flexibility as well.”Although two thirds of his portraits ended up being volunteers, it wasn’t always easy to get people to take part.Chris likened the process to the famine and the feast, and said there were times he struggled to get back to people in time and others when he had only six hours left to find someone.With the end of the project nearing, he will be relaxing for a bit, but hopes to continue on the project in the future.He added: “I definitely want to keep doing something. Who knows, maybe in three months’ time.”There will be an exhibition held at Foodstory, which will begin in early October, upstairs in the cafe.To view the project, visit

understands that, apart from repair work to the new Don bridge, the rest of the £745 million route is fully finished and ready to welcome motorists.However, the Go North East event held earlier this month on the road near Milltimber, left parts of the route damaged, and workers are now rectying issues – including cleaning up oil spills left on the new road and replacing tarmac which was damaged beyond repair.According to a project source, the road could have opened last month but didn’t, in order to accommodate the flagship event – which welcomed thousands of people including pedestrians and cyclists to the route.The source told the Evening Express: “Some of the damage was caused by oil spills at the event, we aren’t sure what caused some of the other damage.“Workers are having to plane out the new surface and replace it in several places – doing roadworks on a new road before it’s opened.“It is going to look like a patchwork quilt.”They added it was a “direct result” of the Go North East event.Transport Scotland declined to comment on the exact nature of the damage, how widespread it was or where it had taken place, but a spokesman said: “Other than minor wear and tear incidents, which are not unexpected and easily rectied, no damage has been experienced as a result of the community event.”The source added that other sections of the road – including the stretch from Craibstone to Stonehaven – had been pencilled in to open in the days following the event and, with the exception of the new Don bridge which is undergoing remedial works, the rest of the route is now complete as far as construction goes.They said: “The road could open today  not for this damage – all construction work is complete.“It could have opened three weeks ago.”Transport Scotland did not deny the claim but said no date had been confirmed for any further openings.The government agency’s spokesman said: “The operational procedure for opening parts of the road to traffic has been discussed with stakeholders, however, as yet, no date has been confirmed for opening.”He added: “There are a range of finishing works which are currently being undertaken by the contractor across the route.“Works which are taking place across the project include the completion of side roads, access tracks, accommodation works, fencing and landscape planting.“It is normal for works of this nature, which do not affect the operation of the main carriageway, to continue for some time after the main carriageway is opened for use.“It is not unusual for minor defects to appear during the construction of major infrastructure projects.“The contractor will undertake any necessary remedial works to ensure that they are completed to the appropriate standard, at no extra cost to the taxpayer.“The project is on target to open by late autumn 2018.

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identication. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly dferent in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering  the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hospice benefits from heavy metal roadshow","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/09/18, 7:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCowal Vintage Transport Club held its charity road run on Saturday September 1, with guests from as far afield as Kintyre, Dunblane and the Borders joining in.A colourful procession of vintage tractors, cars and motorcycles and an old MacBrayne\u0026#8217s bus left Sandbank on the Holy Loch, winding its way across the Cowal peninsula to Otter Ferry, before hugging the Loch Fyne shore northwards to Strathlachlan.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Karen Wylie, 39, is hoping to raise \u0026pound80,000 to fly son Saul - who suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - to America for surgery which will allow him to stand independently and potentially walk. The Post reported earlier this year on the family’s campaign to help Saul whose condition causes muscle stfness in his legs and arms, meaning he cannot stand or walk unaided. The family, from Tarbolton, are fundraising so they can travel the 4000 miles to Missouri for a spinal operation which would dramatically reduce Saul’s spasticity. They hope to take Saul to St Louis Children’s Hospital to see Dr TS Park, a pioneer in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy  surgery. Karen said: “Our objective is to get Saul to the best possible stage to allow us to apply to St Louis Children’s Hospital for him to be evaluated for this le-changing surgery. This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

Eyewitnesses described a noise like an earthquake as the roof came crashing to the ground in Ayr\u0027s Phillips Square. Cars, including a Subaru Imprezza, were crushed underneath as the effect of Storm Ali was felt in full force. The impact of the storm blew the top of the flats off at around 1pm today. Resident David Hose, who stays on the top floor of the block, described the horrying moment.  David, 28, told the Ayrshire Post: It sounded like a mini earthquake, it was a bang like I\u0027d never heard before. I looked outside and couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. The roof was lying on the ground on top of cars and not far from the school playground. It\u0027s a miracle it didn\u0027t kill anyone. Gordon Baillie, 36, a night porter at Ayr\u0027s Mercure Hotel, added: I was sitting on the couch watching telly and heard a big bang. I went to the window and saw my neighbour looking at his car as his Subaru was stuck underneath it. They\u0027ve taped everything off and we\u0027re blocked inside. My partner is still at work so he\u0027ll get a fright when he comes home. Emergency services have now shut off the road in a bid to clear the scene. Police wearing hard hats are on site with loose debris currently blowing around the affected area. It comes as a number of roads have been blocked due to falling trees and debris across Ayrshire.

And son Mason, 21, said: “He was a legend to us all. “Dad moaned about a lot of stuff in le, but never his cancer. “Even when he was told he had three years to live, he made sure he enjoyed it to the full.” In the end, an aggressive form of bowel cancer claimed John’s le just 10 months after his diagnosis. He spent time in the Territorial Army which took him south to London for a stint guarding Her Majesty. Mason recalls: “He got to be involved in some pretty exciting things by all accounts. “He was on duty for the state visit of Nelson Mandela and because of his work I was born down in London.”  But the former car salesman, who served Arnold Clark Toyota in Ayr and Kilmarnock, would become renowned for his service to Ayr Boswell. Mason said: “He set up the 1997s team with Stevie Devlin and brought through so many kids, myself included. “We’ll have so many memories - as diehard Ayr fans we loved going to Somerset Park. “It’s no coincidence that the last game we went to together was when we beat Killie and our picture ended up on the back page of the Ayrshire Post! “He was my dad, best mate and coach all in one.” A fundraiser of former Boswell players raised more than \u0026pound8000 at Dam Park this summer.

family le and his day-to-day dealings with the public in a series of diaries.\nIn 2014, some 40 of Dr Muir\u0026rsquos diaries were presented by his descendants to the Scottish Borders Archive \u0026amp Local History Service, and these were then transcribed by staff at Hawick\u0026rsquos Heritage Hub.\nTwo years later, at the request of Live Borders, Selkirk playwright and actor John Nichol used material from the diaries as the basis for his one-man, one-act play, Dr John Stewart Muir: The Beloved Doctor.\nTaking the title role himself, John\u0026rsquos play received a rapturous reception at its premiere in the town\u0026rsquos County Hotel in February, 2017.\nOne scene features Dr Muir recounting an ambitious cycle ride he took to Moffat in 1916, ing via Boreland, Eskdalemuir and Ettrickbridge.\nIt is this ride that retired local GP John Wilson retraced last Wednesday, following the exact route described by Dr Muir.\n\u0026ldquoI always thought it would be amazing to recreate that ride, John told the Border  this week, \u0026ldquoso I\u0026rsquom just so happy that John Wilson was able to do it.\nJust as Dr Muir had done before him, John stopped off at Moffat\u0026rsquos Buccleuch Arms Hotel, where he was welcomed by director Polly Smith, while on the  journey he stopped at the Cross Keys in Ettrickbridge, where he was given a glass of water by

early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants,

customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum.

Although he has campaigned on his record of establishing peace and stability, some worry those gains are being eroded the longer he stays in power.\nMr Museveni, 74, is now able to seek re-election in 2021 because parliament passed legislation last year removing a clause in the constitution that prevented anyone over 75 from holding the presidency.

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S. Colville and Mr R. W. Greenlees in 1927.Mrs Mary MacFadyen, was the next winner to gain the christian name honour in 1928 and she did not have take three wins.The first and possibly only gentleman to see his christian name used, was the prolic 1950\u0026#8217s winner, Rev.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.  The committee voted to reject the recommendation to approve the plans by seven votes to four."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-hotel-shuts-suddenly","story":"  The County Hotel, run since 2016 by Tony Breathnach, has been shut since last Thursday.\u0026nbsp  The 10-bedroom High Street hotel, which also includes a bar and dining area, was leased to Mr Breathnach by Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars, part of Heineken UK.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

James Waters and Hugh Macdonald, artistic directors, said: \u0026ldquoThis year\u0026rsquos festival is an intoxicating mix of old and new both in performers and the music they play.  \u0026ldquoClarinettist and composer Mark Simpson is an extraordinary musical personality as artist in residence and his involvement has sparked a programme ranging from Stockhausen to Sch\u0026uumltz and presenting some of our favourite artists as well as featuring some thrilling festival debuts.  \u0026ldquoWe have had a lot of fun planning it and really look forward to sharing it with our audiences.  Following the huge success of the 2016 community opera in Dunbar , the Lammermuir Festival has commissioned a new community opera for 2018.  An Cadal Trom by Matthew Rooke features some 150 performers from Dunbar and across the county, a host of volunteers, and professional musicians, including McOpera .

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.

Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-the-tories-are-snatching-away-hope-from-the-children-who-need-it-most","story":"  In its 2016 Holyrood manesto, they welcomed \u0026ldquothe Scottish Government\u0026rsquos recent decision to reintroduce national testing in primary schools. Now Ruth Davidson makes hay attacking the policy, and tries to kill it off.  The politicisation \u0026ndash the weaponisation \u0026ndash of childhood in Scotland stinks to high heaven and it does not edy the nation. Parents are being tormented by two-faced politicians deploying scare tactics about the education of their children. This is not debate, this is double-dealing of the worst order. Sadly, it has been this way for a long time.  From the issue of a Named Person to advocate for young people who might not have the support they need, through to baby boxes, free tuition fees for university students, the smacking ban and now national testing for primary school pupils, you would be forgiven \u0026ndash  you listened to the opponents of the Scottish Government \u0026ndash for thinking that Nicola Sturgeon is the witch from Hansel and Gretel, ready to eat any child who passes her cottage at Bute House made of social democratic gingerbread.  Whether you support those policies or not \u0026ndash and I personally do support those policies as a voter and a parent \u0026ndash the portrayal of the SNP as a party pushing some Stalinist family-crushing plot is clearly bonkers, and those peddling such nonsense know it\u0026rsquos bonkers. But these days, it is often the crazy not the considerate who win the day.  I spoke to John Swinney, the Education Secretary and Deputy First Minister, last week about a growing opposition to free tuition fees by senior university executives. He made it clear that he saw everything to do with the welfare and education of children on a continuum from baby boxes to free university education.  It was all about \u0026ldquovalues, he said \u0026ndash about everyone in society chipping in with taxes to pay for education, and about the state putting out a message that every child, especially the poorest, are cared for, and matter.  Now, of course, you could dismiss Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos comments as political spin \u0026ndash but, I think, he\u0026rsquos telling the truth. Actions speak louder than words, and those policies listed above \u0026ndash the Named Person, baby boxes, the smacking ban, free tuition, national testing \u0026ndash are all saying the same thing to the electorate: we are trying to do the best by your kids. Trying does not mean succeeding, but at least they\u0026rsquore trying.  There\u0026rsquos plenty I disagree with the SNP about, but when it comes to the broad spectrum of policies intended to improve the lives of children, I believe it has the best intentions at heart. And it is trying its best because at the heart of our education system lies a very real problem that the party has to take responsibility for: the struggle to close the attainment gap between children from middle class backgrounds and those from low income homes.  Disadvantaged pupils achieve around half the qualications that the most affluent achieve \u0026ndash that is a failure, especially for a social democratic party.  The opponents of the SNP, chiefly led by the Tories, picked up the attainment problem as a cudgel, and, rightly, beat the SNP over the head with it. As a result, the SNP, rightly, tried to enact policies to close the attainment gap, including national testing \u0026hellip which the Tories supported, but now don\u0026rsquot support, because, like always, what the Tories care about is power and point-scoring not policies which help the worse off in society.  Let\u0026rsquos concentrate, however, on testing in primary schools \u0026ndash intended, obviously, to help monitor failings in attainment so they can be addressed as early as possible. We\u0026rsquore told that the tests are \u0026ldquotraumatising children \u0026ndash especially those in Primary One.  This is embarrassing nonsense. I know plenty of teachers \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquom married to one \u0026ndash and not a single teacher I\u0026rsquove spoken to thinks the tests are traumatising. In fact, they laugh when they hear that. They may not like the tests, they may think they\u0026rsquore pointless, that it adds to an already huge workload \u0026ndash but trauma? Come off it, they say.  Children don\u0026rsquot have to prepare for the tests. The tests are done on iPads so it doesn\u0026rsquot feel like some scary pen and paper assessment. The tests are also \u0026ldquoadaptive which means that  the child is having trouble answering questions then it becomes easier, and  the child is doing well the questions become harder. The tests don\u0026rsquot last long - in P1 it\u0026rsquoll take no longer that 30 minutes once a year.  Some teachers feel the \u0026ldquomumsnet brigade \u0026ndash sharp-elbowed middle-class parents who want to wrap their children in cotton wool \u0026ndash hate the tests because it means their little princes and princesses might not come out with gold stars and A-pluses. What horror \u0026ndash their child might be average.  There are also concerns that it\u0026rsquos these parents who are creating the climate of fear around the tests: tell your child something is scary and the child will find it scary allow the child to do the test without inculcating fear and they\u0026rsquoll see nothing to fear.  So it is within a climate of hypocrisy, fear and falsehood that we are now to see a debate and vote on national testing in primary one, orchestrated by the Tories, which the SNP, according to political insiders, is likely to lose. The Tories have created enough chaos  to block a policy they supported until it became political convenient not to.  We\u0026rsquore going to see a policy \u0026ndash albeit flawed in many eyes, but well-intentioned and crafted to deal with one of society\u0026rsquos biggest problems \u0026ndash sacriced on the altar of political conniving. A chance to do something meaningful in schools when it comes to the education of children will likely be snuffed out.  If there\u0026rsquos any kind of fairy tale metaphor here, it isn\u0026rsquot wicked witch Sturgeon coming to gobble up your children, it\u0026rsquos the Pinocchio-nosed Tory party snatching hope away from children who need it, and locking up opportunity in a high tower that only the wealthy have the keys to, not the poorest."},{"url":null,"title":"independence-eight-times-worse-than-hard-brexit","story":"  Scottish Business UK said independence could cost more than 14 per cent of Scotland\u0026rsquos GDP in terms of damage to trade, the loss of cross-border subsidies and currency costs.  The Tory-dominated cross-party group said this was compared to 1.8% of GDP in a worst case Brexit that forced the UK to rely on WTO rules.  The SNP said the \u0026lsquoWin Win\u0026rsquo report on the benefits of the UK, released to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the No vote in 2014 referendum, was \u0026ldquoludicrously over the top.  Scottish Business UK was set up last year as a vehicle for pro-Union businesses in the event of a second independence referendum.  Its founder and chairman is millionaire Tory donor Robert Kilgour and its chief executive is former Scottish Tory MEP Struan Stevenson.  Mr Kilgour said the question mark over another independence vote was deterring business investment in Scotland and hurting the economy.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur report shows that a second referendum on independence for Scotland will be eight times more damaging than a worse case Brexit scenario to the Scottish economy, and that is a reality that no-one operating in businesses across Scotland could afford to come to fruition.  Mr Stevenson added: \u0026ldquoWe are four years from the last referendum on independence for Scotland which was not supported, yet the spectre of a further referendum remains ever present.  \"We\u0026rsquore calling on the Scottish Government to abandon the demand for another referendum and focus more on reigniting the Scottish economy, so we once again become a credible investment opportunity, on a par with other parts of the UK.  Labour Jackie Baillie MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy.  \"As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.  \"That is not what the people of Scotland need or want.  \"Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThese claims are so ludicrously over the top they show just how rattled the Tories are - they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no .  ?\"Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK\u0027s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland - and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.  ?\"Scotland is already one of the most productive parts of the UK outside London, with resources few countries can match, and independence would allow us to make the most of that huge potential.\""},{"url":null,"title":"no-need-to-devolve-migration-say-uk-advisers","story":"  In a blow to the SNP, and despite most Scots wanting border control devolved, the Migration Advisory Committee  said a dferent migration policy was not merited in Scotland.  The SNP said devolving migration was vital to counter the UK government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohostile \u0026lsquoLittle Britain approach to the issue and to Brexit.  In a long-awaited report on European migration, the MAC said there should be no special preference given to EU workers coming to the UK after Brexit.  It also said there was no evidence that increased EU migration had damaged le in the UK.  It concluded that EU migrants paid more in tax than they took in benefits, contributed more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they accessed, and had no effect on crime rates.  It called on the UK government to make it easier for high-skilled workers to migrate to the UK, and called for no limit to the number of highly-skilled workers allowed in each year.  This is currently capped at 20,700 from non-EU countries.  Despite the SNP arguing for Holyrood to control migration to offset the impact of Brexit, the MAC report said it was not necessary.  It did not opine on whether migration should be devolved or stay reserved - saying that was a political decision - but it did say there was no underlying economic need for it.  It said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government take the view that EU migration to Scotland is essential for preventing a  to population decline, to offset the ageing of the existing population and to support remote communities.  \u0026ldquoAlthough lower migration might lead to population decline, this problem is not something that starts at the Scottish border, some Northern English regions have similar prospects.  \u0026ldquoMigration is much less effective at dealing with a rising old age dependency ratio than increases in the pension age and immigration may not be an effective strategy for sustaining remote communities unless the reasons for locals leaving are addressed.  \u0026ldquoOverall, we were not of the view that Scotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said politically-driven SNP demands for devolved migration were \u0026ldquoentirely unnecessaryand potentially damaging.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe report identies that Scotland\u0026rsquos demographic needs are similar to the rest of the UK and might not be best solved by immigration alone. The fact that a separate Scottish immigration policy may also require a border at Berwick is simply another reason why the SNP must abandon their policy for a separate immigration policy.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie added: \u0026ldquoScotland faces the twin challenges of an ageing population and key worker shortages. But these problems are not unique to us.  \u0026ldquoAreas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland share our population trends and need for agricultural workers, NHS and social care staff. \"This debate needs to be fought UK wide. Cutting ourselves off and looking at this issue in isolation isn\u0026rsquot the smartest way to solve it.  Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs select committee, said the report was \u0026ldquovery puzzling, with \u0026ldquosignicant gapsin its analysis and recommendations.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade, and explicitly made no recommendation on whether immigration should be part of the [Brexit] negotiations. This report still leaves a serious gap in the evidence base.  Scottish Chambers of Commerce boss Liz Cameron said employers would welcome an end to the cap on high-skilled migrants, but would dislike the idea of more charges for them.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt seems counter-intuitive to create further barriers to skilled migration. Any future scheme must provide a streamlined experience for both migrants and firms, while relentlessly seeking to remove bureaucracy and red tape.  Mike Cherry of the Federation of Small Businesses also said the MAC report was a concern, as some of its plans would add to the costs and administrative burden on employers.  SNP migration minister Ben Macpherson told MSPs the report was deeply disappointing.  He said: \u0026ldquoWith all of our population increase to come from migration over the next 25 years, migration is absolutely critical to Scotland\u0026rsquos future prosperity.  \u0026ldquoHowever the MAC report does little to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and instead suggests that increasing the pension age would be a preferential approach to managing demographic change \u0026ndash a completely unsustainable position and one we would reject.  \u0026ldquoThis report will also be deeply disappointing to businesses and employers across Scotland who asked for a simple, low cost approach to migration which took into account the requirements of their sectors."},{"url":null,"title":"relieve-the-gsa-of-responsibility-for-mackintosh-building-art-experts-suggestion-to-msps","story":"  Currently burnt-out, the Mackintosh Building is still at the heart, and perhaps is the soul, of the art school.  However, should the building, disastrously ruined by fire twice in four years, still be run by the educational institution?  That is the provocative question that will be posed to Members of the Scottish Parliament tomorrow by one of Scotland\u0027s leading Mackintosh experts, the writer and gallerist Roger Billclfe.  Mr Billclfe, a vocal critic of the GSA\u0027s responsibility for, and handling of, the building\u0027s first fire in 2014, has suggested in a submission to MSPs that the GSA should be \"relieved of the responsibility\" of the \u0027Mack\u0027.  He says that by the time the building is rebuilt - which GSA chair Muriel Gray said could take up to six years - it will have not been used as a place of teaching for more than a dozen years.  Billclfe believes that the building should be treated as a \"world class work of art\" and could be used as artist accommodation and for exhibitions.  : The Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt says chair  In the conclusion to his submission he says that, because of the unanswered questions around the 2014 fire, the GSA is \"unfit\" to be a custodian of the building.  Mr Billclfe said: \"Temporary accommodation put in force after the 2014 fire will likely have had to be replaced by more permanent arrangements.  \"This seems to be a suitable time to consider relieving the School of its responsibility for the Mackintosh building - something it is believed to have considered in the 1990s when it offered the building to a government agency - and removing the inherent dangers associated with its occupation by a large body of students.  \"This would remove from the School the apparent burden of running a major \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo and also satisfy the growing demand for access, particularly after the injection of \u0026pound30m of public, private and charitable donations to restore the building following the 2014 fire.\"  Mr Billclfe, whose latest book is \u0027Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Art of the Four\u0027, believes the Mackintosh Building, consumed in a blaze for which no cause has yet been established, should be rebuilt from the architect\u0027s plans.  : How the Mack will be remade: Muriel Gray interview  The Committee\u0026nbspis also hearing evidence from Eileen Reid, the former head of widening participation at the school, the architect Malcolm Fraser, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.  The prospect of the GSA giving up their right to the building appears unlikely.  However, there was much anger expressed after the June fire, and how two blazes could have occurred in four years.  The first fire, in 2014, was sparked by an projector igniting some expanded foam being used by a student for a degree show.  Until the police and fire service investigation into the new blaze is complete and published, observers, the public and alumni are in want of reply to questions over cause and responsibility.  : The new Mack will be paid for by insurance and fund raising  A spokesman for the GSA said: \"The Mackintosh Building was commissioned and designed as an art school and GSA is fully committed to it ing as a working art school.\"  In the Herald on Sunday, the chair of the GSA board, Muriel Gray, was adamant the GSA will restore the Mackintosh Building.  Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since 2014.  \"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"  She added: \"Imagine the thrill of saying, \u0027We have an architect for this project: who is it? Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\u0027\"  \"The roads lead back to Mackintosh, absolutely and non-negotiably.  \"As far as we are concerned that decision we made in 2014 has just been interrupted.\"  It has been estimated that the cost could be more than \u0026pound100m, but Ms Gray said she hoped this would be met by insurance and a private funding raising initiative, rather than rely on public funds.  : Mackintosh expert on the rebuild at book festival  The building was insured through an Owner Controlled Insurance Programme .  This was held in the name of the GSA and Kier Construction Scotland Limited, which was in charge of the works at the building.  The restoration of the school following the 2014 fire was due to cost \u0026pound49m in total.  A paper for the Committee says that the GSA have \"communicated with donors regarding the 2018 fire and no donor has requested a  of their donation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-potent-questions-linger-around-the-mack-and-the-gsa","story":"  However, after two fires in four years, not only Mr Billclfe, who suggests the change in his submission to the Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament, has expressed frustration and anger at the GSA.  In his submission, he says the Mack is a world class work of art - and should be henceforth treated as such.  He writes: \u0026ldquoIt would be unthinkable to restore a work of art from the National Galleries, say, and then offer access to it to the person who damaged it in the first place. But this is the scenario  the building is still to be retained by the School of Art on its current basis.  He also calls for a full investigation into the school\u0026rsquos administration at the time of the 2014 fire and subsequent refurbishment.  Billclfe, as others do, believes that the causes and circumstances of the original fire still pose many questions.  There is often anger when there are no quick or ready answers to potent and emotional questions. The world is waiting for the police and fire officers to investigate the ruins of the Mack, to find out what caused or accelerated the blaze this summer.

This compares with children who are ed to their families, who spend an average of nine months away from home.  Academics at the university, and at the Universities of York and Lancaster, tracked the progress children aged under five, who had been taken into care in 2012-13. Of 1,836 children covered by the study, 481 wer looked after at home with their parents, supervised by social work. Meanwhile 1,355 were placed with family members, foster carers or prospective adoptive parents.  After four years, of those removed from home, 31 per cent had been ed to their parents\u0027 care, 11 per cent were living permanently with relatives and 16 per cent had been adopted, while six per cent were in the process of adoption.  A further 32 per cent continued to be looked after away from home.  Lead academic Dr Helen Whincup, from the University of Stirling, said: \u0026ldquoWhat this tells us is that when the child is going home, this happens relatively quickly.

The arrangement would maintain close alignment with the single market.

What we are talking about here is not a border - not a land border, not a sea border it is a set of technical checks and controls.\"  Mr Barnier also told a news conference in Brussels the European Council on October 18/19 would be the \u0026ldquomoment of truth when it would become clear whether or not the two sides could agree a Brexit deal.  \"It is then we shall see  agreement we are hoping for is in our grasp,\" he declared.  His comments came as the Prime Minister prepares for tonight\u0026rsquos dinner at an informal EU summit in Salzburg, where she will seek to get support for her Chequers Plan from fellow European leaders.  She is expected to warn them in clear terms that rejection of her compromise proposals by MPs would lead to a damaging no-deal.  In a further sign of Mrs May\u0027s attempts to build support for the Chequers Plan, she met Manfred Weber, leader of the EPP - the main centre-right group in the European Parliament - in Downing Street on Tuesday.  A No 10 spokesman said: \"On Brexit, Weber recognised the Chequers proposals were a step forward and stressed the priority the European Parliament placed on resolving questions relating to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland as well as to maintaining the integrity of the single market.  Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, said Britain had shown flexibility and now it was time for Brussels to \u0026ldquoreciprocate.  \"If we are to get a deal there has to be compromises from both sides, he insisted.  Elsewhere, UK police chiefs agreed that the policing response to Brexit should be delivered at a UK level, including dealing with any civil disruption in the wake of withdrawal, while recognising Scotland\u0027s \"distinct constitutional arrangements\".  Humza Yousaf, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Justice Secretary, said while he commended Police Scotland\u0027s offer of mutual assistance to other forces, the decision was a \u0026ldquostark reminder of the hugely damaging impact Brexit could have on our security capabilities.  The Roadmap to A People\u0026rsquos Vote, written by Lord Kerr, states: \u0026ldquoThere would be no dficulty obtaining an extension of the Article 50 timetable to allow a People\u0027s Vote to take place. If Parliament judged that it was necessary to delay the March 29 deadline so that it could consult the people in a democratic vote, the Government would not face any political or procedural obstacle to this.  It adds: \u0026ldquoIf there is a deal, the most pressing question for the country would be whether that deal is better than the one we already have inside the EU. And  there is no deal, the country deserves the right to say whether it nevertheless still wants Brexit.  The crossbench peer said: \u0026ldquoThe die is not irrevocably cast, there is still time and, until the UK has left the EU, the Article 50 letter can be withdrawn.  \u0026ldquoIf there is a majority in Parliament for a People\u0026rsquos Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge.  \u0026ldquoShould the UK need more time for a People\u0026rsquos Vote, there is little doubt that the other 27 member states would agree the necessary extension of the Article 50 timetable, added Lord Kerr.  \u0026ldquoHistory will not be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-brexit-dominated-lib-dem-conference-as-vince-cable-waved-goodbye","story":"  The party leader used his farewell keynote speech to insist leaving the EU was \u0026ldquonot inevitable and that it could be reversed  the momentum for a People\u0026rsquos Vote continued to gather pace.

They, claimed the Lib Dem chief, had turned from \u0026ldquobroad churches into intolerant cults.  Which, of course, has left the fourth force in Westminster politics with a golden opportunity.  Yet despite the fact that loyal lieutenants were stressing how the party had doubled its appeal, from 7.4 per cent at the last election to 11 per cent-plus now - actually, a recent poll put the Lib Dems on just six per cent - the yellow peril is not picking up support anywhere near where it should be.  Sir Nick Clegg branded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour \u0026ldquopants, while he dismissed Theresa May and the Tories as \u0026ldquorubbish. Yet,  this is true, then the Lib Dem surge should be happening. But it isn\u0026rsquot.  This is undoubtedly why Vince wants change but saying you want to create a \u0026ldquomovement of the moderates hardly gets the political pulse racing. Many Lib Dems insisted they were not moderates but radicals. And then there is the plan to open up a future leadership contest to non-MPs.  A ripple of expectation rose among the yellow T-shirts when the campaigning businesswoman Gina Miller gave a conference speech but swtly burst the bubble of expectation about her own ambitions when she told delegates that she was not their leader-in-waiting.  In his keynote address, Sir Vince urged Labour and Tory rebels to have the courage to leave and, by implication, join the Lib Dems. No names were mentioned but that of Labour\u0026rsquos Chukka Umunna has been on the lips of some delegates in a positive and a negative way.  And he sought to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn over the People\u0026rsquos Vote issue by telling the Labour comrades that  their leader does not back the second poll, then they should dump him.  But  the Lib Dems are to capitalise on the anti-Brexit sentiment, then they need an energetic, charismatic leader, who doesn\u0026rsquot fluff his lines, to lead the charge to keep Britain in the EU as soon as possible.

She wrote: \u0026ldquoThere have been arguments made against our proposals that have been at odds with the reality of trade negotiations elsewhere and indeed the current trading relationship between EU member states.  Commenting on the EU\u0026rsquos original proposal \u0026ndash to keep Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union, thus moving the border to the Irish Sea \u0026ndash Mrs May declared: \u0026ldquoNeither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between dferent parts of the United Kingdom \u0026ndash which no other country would accept  they were in the same situation \u0026ndash or the UK seeking the rights of EU membership without the obligations.

Tomorrow, over lunch EU leaders will again discuss Brexit albeit without the PM.  Tonight, the PM is expected to have face-to-face talks with Charles Michel, the Belgian premier, with further bilaterals with Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, and Donald Tusk, the European Council President, tomorrow.  Mrs May is likely also to talk to other leaders in the margins of the summit in an effort to win backing for a plan which has met fierce resistance from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.  Her message will be stark:  the EU does not show flexibility and the only deal she can take back to Westminster in November is an unsellable fudge, then MPs will vote it down and there will be a damaging no-deal.  In referring to the EU27\u0026rsquos improved offer, Mr Barnier also made clear that the \u0026ldquomoment of truth would come next month at the European Council. By then, he argued, it should be clear whether or not a deal can be done.  However, Brussels-watchers point out that there is a habit of the European Commission going to the brink and the Salzburg summiteers are expected to announce a special Council meeting in November, probably on the 13th and 14th, to formally seal a deal.  In an interview with the  today Mrs May said hers was the \"right plan\" for the UK while representing a \"good deal for the EU\".  She insisted: \"I\u0027m not going to be pushed away from doing what is necessary to get the right deal for Britain.\"  In her Die Welt article, the PM argues that the Chequers blueprint - a \"common rulebook\" for trade in goods and \"business-friendly facilitated customs arrangement\" - is the only way to resolve the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  \"It is profoundly in both sides\u0027 economic interest, it respects the integrity of the single market and, crucially, no one else has come up with a proposal that could command cross-community support in Northern Ireland that is the only true foundation for stability there.\"  She adds: \u0026ldquoTo come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.  Ahead of today\u0026rsquos summit, Mr Tusk wrote to EU leaders said EU leaders should discuss arrangements for the \"final phase\" of the Brexit talks \"including the possibility of calling another European Council in November\".  He impressed on them the need for \"limiting the damage\" caused by Brexit and added: \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.\"  Meanwhile, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said he expected just \"warm words\" from the EU leaders in Salzburg, stressing \u0026ldquothey won\u0027t give much\".  He asserted Mrs May\u0026rsquos ultimatum of her deal or no deal was a false choice and predicted the EU would \"pile on\" extra demands on money, migration and other issues.  \"All these things will come back and we\u0027ll see more and more pressure, and she will have a deal she won\u0027t be able to bring back to the House of Commons because it\u0027ll be lumbered with loads of other EU demands, so she\u0027s going to have to have something else,\" he told BBC Radio\u0026rsquos Today programme.  He said a \"iety of options\" existed and a chance to \"reset\" would emerge in November.  \u0026ldquoWe get to a point where she will not be able to accept what they offer, they will not be able to accept what she offers, and there\u0027ll have to have some sort of reset. The reset is to step back to what Donald Tusk offered in March\u0026hellipa free trade agreement.\"  On Northern Ireland, Mr Davis added: \"That\u0027s one area where the EU is softening.\"  The Yorkshire MP noted how he had repeatedly told Mrs May there would be a \"pressure point\" late in negotiations.  \"[It\u0026rsquos] always the case with the European Union\u0026hellipthey move at the last possible minute after they\u0027ve tested your mettle, after they\u0027ve taken you to the clf-edge and that\u0027s what will happen.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lord-steel-says-may-should-call-off-brexit-and-back-peoples-vote","story":"  The Liberal Democrat grandee urged her to accept the process was simply too dficult and damaging and that, she should halt it and call a People\u0026rsquos Vote.

He added: \u0026ldquoIn the words of the popular American song: let\u0026rsquos call the whole thing off.  The former Holyrood Presiding Officer\u0026rsquos remarks came as campaigners for a second EU referendum set out a roadmap to obtain a \"People\u0027s Vote\" giving the public the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.  The People\u0027s Vote report, written by Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested the PM could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs in Parliament or that she could even decide to call one herself.  And it insisted that the option of staying in the EU \"must be on the ballot paper\".  But Mrs May brushed aside the calls for a second referendum, saying voters had already made their decision.  \"When the referendum took place, we gave people the opportunity to make a choice. They made that choice,\" she declared.  \"This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country\u0027s history. If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.  \"My answer to the People\u0027s Vote is that we\u0027ve had the people\u0027s vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,\" she added.  The report argues that the March 29 2019 deadline for Brexit could easily be delayed to make time for a vote to be held.  And it warned that politicians would be judged harshly  they denied calls for a People\u0027s Vote on the grounds that it would be too dficult to arrange in the short time remaining.  \"More than two years since the 2016 referendum, a political, economic and possibly constitutional crisis is gathering across the United Kingdom,\" said Lord Kerr, a former head of the diplomatic service.  \"Our view is that the most viable and democratic way of resolving it is to allow the public to have their say on Brexit. To deny them a voice challenges the basic principle of informed consent.\"  And the crossbench peer warned: \"History will not, in our opinion, be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure in order to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country.\"  With opinion polls regularly finding a majority of voters now think the UK made the wrong decision to leave in 2016, the People\u0027s Vote report said it was not too late to \"think again\" about Brexit.  There was \"no insurmountable political or procedural obstacle\" to putting the two-year Article 50 process on hold to provide time for the necessary legislation and practical arrangements to be put in place for a vote, it argued.  And the report said a decision to dump Brexit now would be \"cost-free\" as the UK could retain its existing EU membership terms, including its budget rebate and exemption from joining the euro - while rejoining years later would require them to be renegotiated from scratch.  Drawn up by a cross-party committee including pro-EU MPs, peers and MEPs from Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens, the roadmap outlined six possible routes to a fresh referendum but said others may emerge as events develop.  The report explained that  Mrs May secured a deal with Brussels this autumn, MPs could use parliamentary amendments to force a referendum either when voting on the deal itself or on later legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement.  If her deal were rejected by the Commons, it would be up to Speaker John Bercow to decide whether or not to permit MPs to vote on a fresh referendum when the PM faced Parliament to explain her next steps.  Although Mrs May has consistently said that she would not allow a second referendum, the report suggested she might decide that a public vote was the best way to win a mandate for her deal or to escape the \"constitutional crisis\" of no deal.  \"Facing the very real possibility of overseeing a deeply unpopular and potentially disastrous no-deal Brexit, she may decide that the only way to avert this outcome is to put her deal to the public through a People\u0027s Vote,\" suggested the report.  The sixth option of a vote following victory for a pro-referendum party in a snap general election within the next few months was judged \"very unlikely but not inconceivable\".  The roadmap made no recommendation on the question to be asked in any poll, something that would ultimately be a matter for the independent Electoral Commission.  But it said that, for reasons of \"simplicity, speed and clarity\", it was likely that a two-way choice - either \"the Government\u0027s deal versus stay\" or \"no deal versus stay\" - would be preferred over a multiple choice question.  Any vote should not be delayed by arguments over whether to extend the franchise to include 16 and 17-year-olds and expats or tighten social media rules.  But the report said social media companies should be warned they would face tougher regulation in future  they failed to take all actions within their power to prevent abuse of their platforms by campaigns.  David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, asked how likely a second referendum would be  Parliament willed it, replied: \"Pretty unlikely because most people understand to announce a second referendum would be to invite the European Union to give us the worst deal possible in order to persuade us to stay in.  \"That\u0027s the consequence of a second referendum and is why it\u0027s a very bad idea it\u0027s completely against the national interest.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ends-funding-for-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The move, which exposes Kezia Dugdale to potentially signicant costs, has been seen by some of her fellow MSPs as a \u0026ldquobetrayal and \u0026ldquofactionalism by her pro-Corbyn enemies.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the nationalist Wings Over Scotland website from his home in Bath, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action started last November.  It followed the Lothians MSP accusing him in her Daily Record column of making a homophobic remark about gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell.  Mr Campbell had said Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos son, the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, was \u0026ldquothe sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\".  In her column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets - Mr Campbell vigorously denies homophobia.  Until now, the UK labour party in London has bankrolled all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal support, paying for a QC and an advocate to conduct her defence at Edinburgh Sherf Court.  The costs so far are understand to be close to \u0026pound100,000.  However, to the shock of Ms Dugdale and many other Labour MSPs, the UK party has now ended the arrangement, leaving Ms Dugdale to fend for herself.  Although the party will bear all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos costs to date, it will not pay for any more legal counsel or any damages and costs  she loses.  It is understood UK Labour, which raised \u0026pound56m last year, did not tell Ms Dugdale directly of its decision, but informed her lawyers that it was no longer standing behind her case.  Ms Dugdale, 37, who was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017, opposed Jeremy Corby becoming UK leader, earning the lasting resentment of his supporters, who now dominate the party apparatus.  As the publisher of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos column, it is understood the Daily Record may now supply Ms Dugdale with legal support for the rest of the case.  However any help would not extend to damages and costs  Mr Campbell won his case.  Earlier this month, Sherf Kenneth McGowan refused Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos request to have the action thrown out and agreed to proceed to an evidential hearing.  Ms Dugdale had been on the point of appealing that decision when UK Labour withdrew its support, forcing her to scramble to lodge the appeal.  Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos spokesman said: \u0026ldquoGiven the principles on which it was founded - equality, fairness and justice - the UK Labour Party wholeheartedly committed to paying all legal costs associated with this case from start to finish.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much hoped that all promises will be kept.

Wales voted to leave the bloc by a margin of 52.5 to 47.5 per cent in the 2016 referendum, although recent polls have suggested a swing towards remain. In Scotland, there was a strong majority \u0026ndash 62 to 38 per cent \u0026ndash to remain.  Setting out what he believes should happen  the Prime Minister secured a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, Mr Jones said: \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardf.  \"If that doesn\u0027t happen, then I don\u0027t see any alternative other than a general election where Brexit would be the main issue.  \"If there\u0027s an inconclusive result as a result of that general election, well, how then do you resolve the issue without going back to the very same people who took the decision in the first place?

His remarks came as battle-lines were being drawn ahead of this evening\u0026rsquos informal EU summit in Salzburg when Mrs May will seek to convince her fellow leaders of her Chequers Plan.

Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May\u0027s minority administration in Parliament, gave Mr Barnier\u0027s proposals short shrt.  \"It still means a border down the Irish Sea although with dferent kinds of checks,\" said the party\u0027s deputy leader, adding: \u0026ldquoThe fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British prime minister could accept such a concept. It is not just Unionists who object.\"  Meanwhile, Donald Tusk made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Those positive areas included foreign and security policy co-operation, he explained.  But in a blow to Mrs May\u0027s approach, Mr Tusk noted: \"On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic co-operation the UK\u0027s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.  He added that perhaps there was now \u0026ldquomore hope but there is surely less and less time\".  According to extracts released ahead of Mr Davis\u0027s speech, the former Cabinet minister will say: \"We have been told that the Chequers proposal fulfils what the British people voted for. Well, I am afraid I simply do not buy that.  \"Fty-two per cent of British voters oppose the proposals. Only 18 per cent approve. It is quite remarkable for a government policy to be that unpopular. And, for me, the Chequers plan was always a non-starter.  He noted how in her speeches at Lancaster House and at the Mansion House, the PM had promised to  control over the country\u0026rsquos laws, money and borders. These promises, he stressed, were in the Tory manesto too, yet the Chequers Plan crossed all of those red lines.  \"The EU is often correctly described as having a democratic deficit. But Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether.  \"This is why many of us will shortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision.\"  Mr Davis will go on to say that German companies should not fear a more competitive UK outside the EU but, rather, should \"embrace the opportunity that it will create for German workers, families and businesses large and small\".  \"In the long run, the friendly economic competition between neighbours is massively beneficial.  \"Beneficial for the German companies whose supply chains will be provided with improved components from British factories, beneficial for the consumers of tomorrow, who will enjoy the fruits of a more competitive global economy, and beneficial for the students and entrepreneurs of all Europe,\" the Yorkshire MP will add."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-loses-vote-on-p1-assessments","story":"  Holyrood voted by 63 to 61 in favour of a Conservative motion to pause national standardised tests for P1s, after complaints from teachers and parents.

The decision saw the Greens, Labour and LibDems line up with the Tories while only the SNP voted for a continuation of the computer-based literacy and numeracy tests.  Nicola Sturgeon was seen talking intently to Mr Swinney as the vote was taking place.  The defeat at Holyrood came just three months after Mr Swinney was forced to shelve his flagship Education Bill because teachers and other parties would not support the reforms.

She told the Education Secretary: \u0026ldquoI think the time has come, because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.\"  Ms Smith was \u0026ldquocrystal clear that the Conservatives continued to support the use of national standardised assessments at P4, P7 and S3 as a \u0026ldquocrucial part of improving education and attainment, and measuring progress in our schools.  However, she said Tories had raised their \"misgivings\" about using the tests on four and five-year-olds over the last two years.  Mr Swinney said he was \u0026ldquoappalled by the Conservative Party and accused it of \u0026ldquodeceit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are playing politics with the education of our children and we will not play along with them.  He defended the assessments as an essential part of a good education system, an integral part of effective teaching and learning, and part of \u0026ldquonormal classwork that took little time.  He told MSPs: \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely vital to get as much information as possible on children\u0027s achievement as early as possible. Less than an hour a year on average is taken to ensure that the play-based learning undertaken by children is equipping them with the core skills we believe they should acquire by the end of P1.  Labour\u0026rsquos Iain Gray said that, despite assurances to the contrary, the Government had \u0026ldquomanaged to introduce assessments which feel like high-stakes tests to teachers and pupils but which didn\u0027t produce statistically valid comparative measurements.  Mr Gray told the chamber: \"One teacher summed it up to me by saying, \u0027I cannot use the data from these tests to support my teaching in any way\u0027.\"  He said the \"flaws\" applied to the whole of the Scottish national standardised assessments, but particularly in relation to P1.  \"There are many stories of four and five-year-olds upset even to the point of tears by questions they find incomprehensible,\" he said.  \"Far from these assessments being an integral part of every day teaching, teachers tell us they have lost 30, 40 even 50 hours of valuable teaching time for each of the literacy and numeracy tests.\"  He urged the Government to \"listen to the teachers\" and \"scrap the tests in primary one\".  Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said his party opposed all standardised tests, not just P1.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe very presence of the tests and the impact they have on pupil experience and teaching is a net negative. Pupils often react badly to the tests. Some experience anxiety and fear, in others it elicits boredom.  He said teachers are also pressured, whether intentionally or not, to teach to the test.  \"Teachers are concerned that the results of assessments far beyond the primary one level will be used by senior management and others to form a judgement on their professional ability as well,\" the MSP said."},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie campaign to be discussed at holyrood","story":"        The Save Bennachie Alliance will head to the Scottish Parliament this week to discuss its campaign.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 5:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 5:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 5:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

So we are asking the members of the community to vote for their Christmas lights.

Since then, the band has played at ious local venues supporting charities and community projects.On September 21, the BYOB charity dance from 7pm until 11pm will benefit the nearby Groam House Museum, an outstanding centre for Pictish and Celtic art.Tickets, which cost \u0026pound10 for adults and \u0026pound5 for children aged 16 and under \u0026ndash or \u0026pound25 for a family of four \u0026ndash may be bought in advance from Groam House Museum and Rosemarkie Spar shop or on the door on the night.The event is one of a series being organised by the volunteers of Groam House to raise funds for ongoing repairs and renewals following the rapid decline in Highland Council support.The unique display is focused on 15 carved Pictish stones which all originated in Rosemarkie, an important centre for early Christianity. The pride of the permanent display is the magnicent Rosemarkie cross slab, decorated with Pictish symbols and Christian crosses.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 5:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There are 110 new cruise ships being built around the world at present.Ms McGuire said: \"They all need somewhere to go and we aim to make Invergordon as attractive as possible.\"David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The more that the Port Authority and cruise ship agents work with appropriate local businesses to help them understand and adapt to meet the needs of this lucrative market, and then promote them actively to passengers before they reach port, the better for all concerned.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

A motion calling for the tests for four and five-year-olds to be axed was narrowly voted through by 63 to 61.            An amendment from the Scottish Government, describing the assessments as a “key tool” that could be “especially valuable” in closing the attainment gap, was defeated by 61 votes to 63.            Tory MSP Liz Smith had earlier led calls in Holyrood for the Scottish Government to scrap national assessments for P1 pupils.The Conservative education spokeswoman said while her party had previously backed the use of the tests, they had been wrong to do so.The Scottish Government appears to be facing defeat in today’s vote on the use of national assessments for P1 pupils.: John Swinney told to ‘listen’ and scrap P1 testsMSPs at the Scottish Parliament are expected to back the Tory motion calling on ministers to halt the use of tests for the youngest students.            “We made a mistake about P1,” Ms Smith said at today’s debate.She told education secretary John Swinney: “I think the time has come because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.”Ms Smith went on to say she had been contacted by a primary teacher who said “there have been some very good questions in the new test, but others have undoubtedly created problems”, adding these had been the “catalyst for the current complaints”.The teacher also complained that “some questions are too long, taking up too much time and there is an overemphasis on data handling within each assessment”.            Mr Swinney explained the tests had been introduced after the OECD reviewed the Scottish education system in 2015.He told MSPs: “We sought external independent opinion, which said that we did not have enough information about learning outcomes and progress. So we have put in place the standardised assessments.”The education secretary continued: “Assessment is an essential part of a good education system, it is an integral part of effective teaching and learning.”He stressed there was “nothing new” about testing youngsters in their first year of school.Mr Swinney said: “The vast majority – 29 out of 32 local authorities – were using some form of standardised assessment before the national scheme was introduced and, crucially, the majority were not just assessing P1 children, they were assessing P1 children twice during the year.”            He went on: “It is absolutely vital to get as much information as possible on children’s achievement as early as possible.”Holyrood’s four opposition parties are all against national standardised assessments for four and five-year-olds.But while the minority SNP administration is facing defeat on the issue, the result of the vote is not binding on the government.Mr Swinney continues to insist the tests are a “valuable tool for teachers to identy the next steps in a child’s learning” and that the “additional information they provide is particularly useful in the early years  we are to continue to close the attainment gap”.He demonstrated the tests to both MSPs and the media on Tuesday in a bid to ensure an “accurate and informed debate”.But opposition leaders say  the Scottish Government is defeated, Mr Swinney should respect the wishes of the Parliament and call a halt to the tests.Conservatives submitted the motion, which questions  the assessments are “in line with the play-based learning philosophy” of early years education, after some teachers reported P1 pupils had been reduced to tears.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802300.1537372943!/image/image.jpg","title":"storm ali 70 000 scottish homes without power amid high winds","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

European Council president Donald Tusk said the Prime Minister’s Chequers blueprint was a “welcome evolution” in the UK’s approach, but major issues remained to be resolved, including avoiding a hard border in Ireland and the future trading relationship between Britain and the EU.            Warning there was “less and less time” to reach a deal before the UK’s 29 March 2019 exit date, Mr Tusk confirmed he would propose an emergency EU Brexit summit next month.            : Tories lead calls in Holyrood to scrap Scottish P1 testsHis comments came as the Prime Minister prepared to address her EU counterparts at a meeting in Salzburg – the first such gathering since the Chequers plan was published.Mrs May will use the meeting to say that now the UK has showed it is willing to “evolve” its position, the EU must also be prepared to show flexibility.But in a blow to her efforts to persuade fellow leaders of the viability of her plan, it emerged her former Brexit secretary David Davis had described Chequers as a “non-starter”.In extracts of a speech he plans to deliver in Munich tomorrow, Mr Davis said the PM’s plan crossed all of her own negotiating red lines.            And he said: “Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether. This is why many of us will shortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision.”Mr Tusk told reporters in Salzburg: “The Brexit negotiations are entering the decisive phase.“Various scenarios are still possible today but I would like to stress that some of Prime Minister May’s proposals from Chequers indicate a positive evolution in the UK’s approach, as well as the will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit.”Those positive areas included foreign and security policy co-operation, he said.            But in a blow to Mrs May’s approach, he said: “On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic co-operation the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated”.“Today there is perhaps more hope, but there is surely less and less time,” he added, as he confirmed he would propose a mid-November summit.Efforts to find an acceptable way to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland suffered a further setback as Mrs May’s DUP allies poured cold water on the latest EU offer.Ahead of the summit in Austria, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he was ready to come forward with a new offer on the Irish border.In order to “de-dramatise” the main obstacle to a withdrawal deal, Mr Barnier suggested arrangements could be made to conduct the majority of checks on imports and exports away from the border itself.            But the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May’s minority administration in Parliament, dismissed Mr Barnier’s proposals as unpalatable because they would involve a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“It still means a border down the Irish Sea although with dferent kinds of checks,” the party’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said.“The fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British prime minister could accept such a concept. It is not just unionists who object.”The Department for Exiting the EU welcomed the commitment by Brussels to resolving the issue, but stressed Britain “could not accept Northern Ireland being separated off from the UK customs territory”.The Salzburg meeting came as campaigners in the UK published a blueprint setting out how MPs could force the Prime Minister to accept what they call a People’s Vote on her deal, with the option of remaining in the EU.Despite Mrs May insisting the choice was between her deal or no deal, Treasury minister Mel Stride appeared to suggest a second poll was still a possibility.Mr Stride told Sky News: “When we have a firm deal on the table, I suspect that those to the right of the party – the pro-Brexit wing – will be very concerned that  that deal does not prevail, they will end up in the situation where we could have a second referendum or we could end up not leaving the EU altogether, so there is a danger of that happening  Chequers does not prevail.”Mr Tusk’s intervention in Salzburg came just hours before a working dinner at the Felsenreitschule – the theatre where the Von Trapp family performed before fleeing the Nazis in The Sound Of Music movie – where Mrs May will set out her plan and explain why Brussels should show more flexibility to give her the support she needs.As part of the drive to set out the UK’s position to the EU’s leaders, she used an article in German newspaper Die Welt to explain her stance.The Chequers blueprint - a “common rulebook” for trade in goods and “business-friendly facilitated customs arrangement” - is the only way to resolve the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, she said.“It is profoundly in both sides’ economic interest, it respects the integrity of the single market and, crucially, no-one else has come up with a proposal that could command cross-community support in Northern Ireland that is the only true foundation for stability there,” she said.Mrs May added: “Neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between dferent parts of the United Kingdom - which no other country would accept  they were in the same situation – or the UK seeking the rights of EU membership without the obligations.”Mrs May is expected to use the Salzburg summit to hold formal face-to-face talks with Belgian premier Charles Michel today and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar and Mr Tusk tomorrow.She may talk to other leaders in the margins of the summit in an effort to win backing for a plan which has met fierce resistance from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building.

If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.\nTo be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

give vital safety advice for local students","story":"\nAs college and university students prepare for a new academic year, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council is encouraging students to keep safe by\u0026#160being aware of potential hazards in their home or student accommodation.\n\n                \nBeing mindful of potential hazards in the home and putting in place some simple home safety measures can make the dference between le and death.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHere are some of the main hazards in the home and steps that can be taken to reduce their risk.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCarbon Monoxide is a poisonous gas that has no smell or taste. It is produced when fuels such as gas, oil, coal and wood don’t fully burn. Household appliances that are powered by such fuels include boilers, gas fires, central heating systems, water heaters, cookers and open fires.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBreathing in carbon monoxide can make you unwell and,  you are exposed to high levels, can kill. Symptoms of carbon monoxide aren’t always obvious, particularly at low-level exposure. The most common symptoms include a tension-type headache dizziness nausea and vomiting tiredness and confusion stomach pain and shortness of breath and dficulty breathing.\n\nEnsure your home or student accommodation has a working carbon monoxide alarm in rooms where a fuel burning appliance is located and test the alarm regularly. If you have a gas appliance, make sure to ask your landlord for a gas safety certicate to show that it has been serviced annually.\n\nSmoke alarms should be installed on every level in student homes and should be tested weekly. Be aware of the dangers of phone chargers. Counterfeit phone chargers can be deadly as they are often made with poor quality components that fail to meet UK safety regulations. Always use the charger supplied with the phone. Never leave your phone to charge overnight as it can potentially cause a fire due to overheating.\n\nAlways remember to lock doors and close windows when leaving the house, even  it is only for a few minutes.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor information or advice contact Environmental Health on 0300 0300

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"primark donates 50000 to","story":"\n\nPRIMARK\n say they will donate £500,000 to Belfast City Council’s recovery programme, almost a month after the devastating fire at their city centre store.\n\nThe blaze at Bank Buildings has closed 14 nearby businesses that lie within a cordon around the iconic building which is set to be in place for at least four months.\n\nIn a statement, Primark said they are donating the money as a “gesture of goodwill”.\n\nA Primark spokesperson said: \u0026#8220Following the devastating fire at Bank Buildings, Primark has been focused on the welfare of our colleagues, while also working with the authorities regarding our on-going commitment to businesses and the wider community in Belfast. \n\n\u0026#8220It is our intention to be back up and trading again as soon possible.

Despite the Troubles shutting down parts of the city, he is determined to play his headline slot in the Harp Bar even  it means playing to an audience of one. It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

I would encourage any groups or businesses who are interested in becoming tenants to get in touch.”\n\nShe added: “Our vision for the city, as outlined in the Belfast Agenda, is to create employment and opportunity, foster business growth and increase tourist spend – and this project will do all three. When complete, this facility will be an important economic driver for the west of the city and will also be an important driver for tourism.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of how the new St Comgall’s community hub will look when completed. The £7 million regeneration project was awarded funding through the council’s Belfast Investment Fund and the Executive Office’s Social Investment Fund under the Delivering Social Change framework. \n\n\n\n\nThe expression of interests is open for six weeks, until Wednesday October 31.\n\nDr. Mark Browne, Deputy Secretary, Executive Office said: “This project is a great example of central and local government working together with communities to deliver a shared vision with real benefits for local people.”\n\nPlans for the building include a multi-purpose /conference hall, opening out onto a restored central courtyard with a glass pyramid roof, as well as an exhibition space, permanent visitor attraction, office accommodation and a café and information point.\n\nGerry McConville from Falls Community Council added: “This is a really exciting development for the whole of Belfast, but in particular, west Belfast. Falls Community Council has been working with the local community for over a decade to see this restoration happen so it will provide a good social and economic boost to the area to see the building redeveloped and back in use.\n\n“As a school, St Comgall’s was an important part of the lives of so many people and we look forward to it being an important part in the lives of many more for generations to come.\n\n“Due to its location and the modern facilities, St Comgall’s has to offer, we see this as an excellent opportunity for businesses to locate and we would encourage anyone looking for office or business premises to come and have a look at what is on offer.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup man defies party to back gay pride event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We\u0027ll wait and see  Cllr Smith can have any influence on his DUP colleagues in making sure this motion is passed as it should be.\n\n\"Ards Town Hall has been lit up before and there\u0027s no reason why it shouldn\u0027t continue.\"\n\nMr Smith could not be reached for comment last night.\n\nThe DUP also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month there was controversy when DUP members of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council used a procedural mechanism known as a call-in to stop the Pride flag being flown on council premises.\n\nThe motion at Ards and North Down council called for its corporate affairs committee to back a proposal affirming that lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people be accepted and valued as equal citizens, with Ards Town Hall lit up in rainbow colours to coincide with Pride day.\n\nThe motion was supported at the committee by six councillors - three Ulster Unionist, two Alliance and one DUP - with five DUP councillors voting against.\n\nMr Walker added: \"As the father of a gay man, I know how much value parents place on creating an environment where our children can feel valued and accepted at a time when they need support in understanding their own minds and bodies.\n\n\"It might seem trivial to place store on the physical act of lighting council buildings in rainbow colours on Pride day, but the message of acceptance that will send out to our LGBT community, their family and their friends will be very powerful.\n\n\"There is nothing more isolating than feeling dferent to everybody around you. And when that is coupled with living in an environment which amplies that dference, then the pressure can be unbearable.\n\n\"As a council we are unable to change the feelings iniduals might have, but we can certainly create an environment of acceptance and love that will give our LGBT brothers and sisters time and space to fulfil their lelong potential.\"\n\nThe motion was presented by Alliance councillor Andrew Muir.\n\nHe said: \"I presented this motion in the hope that we could make a positive dference to the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people living, working or visiting our borough and I\u0027m delighted to have secured backing of the relevant council committee in affirming that LGBT people should be accepted and valued just like everyone else.\"\n\nIn June, DUP leader Arlene Foster made headlines by attending a PinkNews event at Stormont, where she told the LGBT community that she looks at them \"as my neighbours or my fellow citizens\".\n\nMr Muir hopes \"common sense\" will prevail next week.\n\n\"At the Pink News event on June 28 this year DUP leader Arlene Foster stated she wanted to acknowledge the contribution of the LGBT community in Northern Ireland and to recognise the reality of ersity among our citizens.\n\n\"She further recognised that some of our brightest and best in this country are part of the LGBT community. This motion is only a reflection of those words.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup rejects barnier bid to solve ireland border obstacle to brexit progress","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British Prime Minister could accept such a concept. It is not just unionists who object.\n\n\"And anyone with the desire to see our economy prosper will not want to see barriers put in the way of sales to and from our biggest market in the rest of the UK.\n\n\"There is however one upside in all of this. Having dismissed technology as magical thinking for the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland it is suddenly okay for the border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Progress of sorts!”\n\nThe issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has emerged as the main obstacle to an agreement ahead of the UK’s withdrawal in March 2019.\n\nThe EU is insisting on a “backstop” proposal which would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union in the event of the two sides failing to reach an agreement in order to avoid the  of a “hard border”.\n\nHowever Mrs May has rejected the plan as unacceptable arguing that it would effectively create a border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nMr Barnier said he was working on a plan to “de-dramatise” the controls that would be necessary in the event of the backstop coming into play.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe border between Londonderry and Donegal at Bridgend \n\n\n\n\n“We are ready to improve this proposal. Work on the EU side is ongoing.\n\n“We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed,” he said.\n\n“We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets. We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.”\n\nHe reminded the British, however, that the checks were the result of their decision to leave not only the EU but also the single market and the customs union.\n\n“What we need in the withdrawal agreement is a legally operational backstop which fulls respects the territorial integrity of the UK.\n\n“It is a backstop that will only apply unless a better solution is found,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as EU leaders prepare to gather in Salzburg on Wednesday for an informal summit – the first time they have met together since Mrs May published her Chequers blueprint for Brexit in July.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ian paisley petition of recall closes what happens next","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

So election officials are waiting until midnight in order to ensure they operate well within the law.\n\nWhen counting begins it will be held at the Electoral Office\u0027s Belfast headquarters. However, unlike an election and as there is no candidates, no one will be allowed into the room to see the process other than officials and independent observers.\n\n\"As there are no stages, no candidates, it should be relatively straight forward,\" said Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea who estimates the process should end by 2am.\n\nHowever, once the result is known the Electoral Office will then inform the Commons Speaker\u0027s office.\n\n\"Once the Speaker\u0027s officer acknowledges the result we can then make it public,\" added Ms McVea.\n\n\"We should get that acknowledgment fairly soon.\"\n\nIan Paisley has been suspended from the DUP while it carries out its own investigation. His Commons ban has left current Prime Minister Theresa May shorn of one of her 10 DUP MP confidence and supply allies during a period that could witness several crucial Brexit votes.\n\nShould the petition come out in favour it will be for MPs to move a writ calling a by-election. Once that is done the timeline for a vote should be known shortly after.\n\nIn the 2017 general election, Mr Paisley retained his North Antrim seat with a landslide 20,000-plus majority, securing nearly 59% of the vote.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein mla removes tweet ahead of paisley recall petition close","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

If that is the case, are the bookmakers taking bets or the political pundits offering opinions also going to receive similar calls?\" Mr McGuigan said. \n\nChief Electoral officer Virginia McVea said she contacted Mr McGuigan to advise him of the law in regard to the petition process. \n\nShe said: \"It is not up to this office to prosecute and I advised him of that and of the law in regard to the petition of recall process. \n\n\"The petition of recall legislation makes it a criminal offence to forecast the result. \n\n\"This is new legislation for everyone and I wanted to let Mr McGuigan know and I understand he has taken the decision to remove the tweet.\"\n\nIt is understood the police are aware of the tweet. \n\nMs McVea said, for the first ever petition of recall, observers from London had been across to oversee the process. \n\n\"It will be interesting to hear what their feedback will be on it,\" she said. \n\nIn his statement the Sinn Fein MLA also criticised the decision of the Electoral Office to only open three centres, when it had the option of opening 10. \n\nNorth Antrim constituents were given six weeks to either sign the petition at the three centres or by post.  \n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch follow storm ali across northern ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

BBC NI forecaster Cecilia Daly explained: \"This is the first named storm of the year, and it\u0027s only when the warning reaches amber level that the naming kicks in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLIVE updates: Storm Ali hits Northern Ireland: 51,000 without power and it\u0027s going to get worse, warns NIE Networks\n \n\n\n\n \nWoman dead after caravan blown off clf as Storm Ali strikes\n\n\n\n\n \nNorthern Ireland traffic: Fallen tree on M2 - Storm Ali unleashes havoc\n \n\n\n\n\"The warning has been issued between 8am and 5pm and we\u0027re expecting the east coast area and the Ards peninsula to see winds gusting up to 75mph.\n\n\"At this time of year it\u0027s particularly dangerous as we\u0027re just into autumn and the leaves are still on the trees, so the wind causes extra momentum.\n\n\"We can expect more trees to come down because of that extra weight - more than  we had the same wind speed in the middle of winter.\n\n\"Anyone with summer furniture, bins or trampolines in the garden should be careful not to get caught unawares.\n\n\"The strongest winds will hit during the morning rush hour and through lunchtime, but there could be strong isolated gusts anywhere across the country.\"\n\nDaly added: \"We don\u0027t actually see amber warnings that often so obviously people should exercise caution as the first \u0027big blow\u0027 of the autumn can cause extra damage.\"\n\nThe Met Office warned: \"Strong winds affecting Northern Ireland early in the day will continue to strengthen through the morning.\n\n\"Road, rail, air, and ferry services are likely to be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations a possibility. Roads and bridges may close, with fallen trees expected.\n\n\"The public is also advised to take care near to the coastline, with injuries from large waves and beach material being thrown onto the seafront.\n\n\"Power services could be impacted, with other services like mobile phone coverage also potentially affected.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv shows moment disgruntled clubber storms dance floor in his car","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The defence case is expected to open on Thursday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"uber eats admits accidentally urging couriers to work through storm ali","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

His lawyers call the treason charge false.\n\nUgandan authorities said police will escort him from the airport to his home to maintain order. They said “unlawful rallies, processions and assemblies” will not be allowed.\n\nThat drew an immediate response from Mr Ssentamu, who tweeted from an airport lounge in Amsterdam: “I am a free Ugandan with the right to move freely in my country. The police has no business telling me who receives me and who cannot or where I go and where I cannot. This impunity must stop now.”\n\nThe 36-year-old says he is fighting for freedom from oppression and wants Mr Museveni, in power since 1986, to retire. \n\n\nI am a free Ugandan with the right to move freely in my country. The police has no business telling me who receives me and who cannot or where I go and where I cannot. This impunity must stop now. \nWama see you friends tomorrow.\n#PeoplePower_OurPower\n ✊\n— BOBI WINE  \nSeptember 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMr Museveni has accused opposition figures of trying to lure young people into rioting. Mr Ssentamu has a big following among poor, unemployed young people in urban areas.\n\nMr Ssentamu has alleged he was tortured by members of the presidential guard who arrested him on August 14 and detained him for several days. The government denies the allegations.\n\nHis arrest sparked riots by demonstrators demanding his release and security forces violently put down protests in the capital, Kampala.\n\nDozens of global musicians have condemned the treatment of the singer, and the European Union parliament and some US senators have urged Ugandan authorities to respect basic human rights.\n\nMr Museveni, a key US ally on regional security, took power by force and has since been elected five times. Although he has campaigned on his record of establishing peace and stability, some worry those gains are being eroded the longer he stays in power.\n\nMr Museveni, 74, is now able to seek re-election in 2021 because parliament passed legislation last year removing a clause in the constitution that prevented anyone over 75 from holding the presidency. Mr Ssentamu publicly opposed that decision.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public urged stay safe high winds heavy showers continue","story":"\nA local councillor has urged people to take all necessary precautions as the stormy weather continues.\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Kevin Campbell  has advised the Derry public to heed the current amber weather warning issued by the Met Office.\n\nIt comes after trees and hoardings and roof tiles have blown down across the city.\n\n\"I would urge caution as driving conditions will be dangerous at times and rail, air and ferry services may be affected.  There is also the possibility of longer journey times and cancellations are possible,\" he said.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“All road users should take extra care of loose debris and be mindful that tree falls and some structural damage are possible.\n\n“Power cuts may occur, and I would advise members of the public to report any damage to poles or electricity lines immediately and to stay clear.\n\n“People should keep informed about the weather and act to protect yourself and your home from the effects of flooding and high winds, and importantly to heed safety warnings.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"love island star touch derry beauty event foyleside shopping centre later month","story":"\nOn Saturday 29th September, Love Island 2018 favourite, Alexandra Cane will visit the North West’s premier shopping destination, Foyleside Shopping Centre, as the popular retail mecca hosts its fashion and beauty extravaganza of the year.

site in the Bogside area of Derry have been halted after an ‘unknown purchaser’ bought the lands, it has emerged.\n\nThe derelict lands at Meenan Square have for the last number of years been the source of anti-social behaviour in the area, having also been the site of a number of controversial bonfires.\n\nIn the wake of the most recent bonfire on August 15, which followed six nights of continuous rioting in the area, local councillors proposed that a number of solutions to address the problem, including the demolition of buildings, now be looked at.\n\nThe Urban Villages initiative had been planning to develop the site ‘for a range of purposes’ which would include a ‘community aspect’.\n\nOverseen by the Executive Office , the Urban Villages  initiative is designed to improve good relations outcomes and develop thriving places where there has been a history of deprivation and community tension.\n\nA representative from Urban Villages told the September meeting of the council’s Environment and Regeneration Committee that Apex Housing Ltd was lined up as their partner to deliver the project.\n\nHowever, the meeting was told that the site had been bought by an ‘unknown purchaser’.\n\nUrban Villages have asked the selling agent for contact with the inidual to ‘establish the new owner’s intentions for the site’ and in the meantime they have been ‘developing a

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily. It will be open at weekends.\n\nLocal councillor Dermot Curran has expressed concern that motorists and visitors to the area face more disruption and believes the resurfacing work should have been completed during the recent road closures.\n\nHe plans to contact the Department for Infrastructure to ensure the resurfacing work can be completed as soon as possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main road linking Downpatrick and Ardglass carries a high volume of traffic, with a lot of this associated with the village\u0026rsquos fishing industry. These road closures are disruptive and I am disappointed the drainage upgrade and resurfacing work was not completed at the same time, continued Cllr Curran.\n\n\u0026ldquoI am fully supportive of the much-needed investment along this particular route, but feel the timing of the work to minimise road closures and disruption could have been handled better.\n\nAlso this week, Cllr Curran has revealed a similar situation has arisen on the Strangford side of Ardglass where a road was closed recently as part of planned improvements.\n\nA section of the road linking the village with Chapeltown was closed in mid-July to upgrade drainage systems and is now closed again. Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment. I just sometimes think that the execution of the schemes could be better to minimise disruption.\n\n\u0026ldquoFor example, the closure of the Chapeltown Road which links Ardglass with Strangford will be in operation when children  to school for the new term.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Championships getting serious  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO remain on target for a magical seven-in-a-row as the race for the Down Senior Football Championship crown starts to intensy.\n\nPaul McIver\u0026rsquos record-breakers saw off Downpatrjck on a score of 2-14 to 0-10 in Newcastle on Saturday evening and now await the draw to see who they will meet in the semi-finals.\n\nThe draw was to have been made on Monday night following the clash between Loughinisland and Warrenpoint, but as that finished level at 0-9 apiece, the draw will now take place in St Malachy\u0026rsquos Park, Castlewellan, after Saturday\u0026rsquos replay.\n\nDownpatrick were expected to push Kilcoo all the way in their quarter-final, but the threat never materialised.\n\nKilcoo had just too know how for Downpatrick and second half goals from Ceilum Doherty and a ing Ryan Johnston put the issue out of the RGU\u0026rsquos reach.\n\nJoining Kilcoo in the semi-finals are Mayobridge and Burren with the fourth place waiting on the outcome of the Loughinisland v Warrenpoint replay.\n\nMayobridge were taken to the wire by Clonduff in their quarter-final tie and only emerged 2-16 to 2-15 winners after a mighty Clonduff fightback just fell short.\n\nBurren had their hands full against Castlewellan on Sunday night, but they were able to spring Donal O\u0026rsquoHare from the bench and his contribution of three points at a crucial stage of the game proved decisive \u0026mdash Burren scraping home 0-10 to 0-7.\n\nCoincidentally, despite the fact that the current system used for the SFC and IFC has been heavily criticised, the top four teams in Division 1 of the ACFL \u0026mdash should Warrenpoint go through \u0026mdash are all in the last four.\n\nIt is a similar case in the IFC with Bredagh, Liatroim and Darragh Cross \u0026mdash who were all expected to reach this stage of the competition \u0026mdash joining Division 3 leaders Saul in the semi-finals.\n\nThe IFC draw was made in Monday night and pits Darragh Cross against East Down rivals Liatroim with Saul clashing with Bredagh in another all East Down derby.\n\nDarragh were extremely impressive in their 2-8 to 0-6 demolition of Drumgath in Kilcoo on Monday night, while Liatroim enjoyed a 2-17 to 0-12 win over Tullylish.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
