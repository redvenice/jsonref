We’re seeing an explosion of interest in flat earth theories and increasing mistrust of governments.’In a speech, NHS worker David Marsh claims he has disproved planetary motion, using a Nikon camera and an app from his back garden.Marsh says, ‘My research destroys big bang cosmology. It supports the idea that gravity doesn’t exist and the only true force in nature is electromagnetism.’Some Flat Earthers claim that Earth is in fact moving upwards, and that’s what keeps us ‘pinned down’, rather than gravity.Belief that the Earth is flat has rocketed in recent years, with self-styled experts promoting the theory – along with some celebrities.In 2015, American rapper B.o.B. – aka Bobby Ray Simmons Jr – revealed on Twitter that he was a Flat Earther.Simmons said, ‘No matter how high in elevation you are…the horizon is always eye level…sorry cadets…I didn’t wanna believe it either.’Rapper B.o.B. (Picture: Getty)‘Don’t believe what I say, research what I say. I’m going up against the greatest liars in history … you’ve been tremendously deceived.’Simmons has since engaged in online debates with scientists, and attempted to raise funds for a rocket mission to establish whether the Earth is, in fact, flat.Pie company spiked its own chicken and bacon slice with chunk of metalFormer England cricketer ‘Freddie’ Flintoff revealed last year that he was obsessed with a podcast called the Flat Earthers – and coming round to their ideas.Flintoff said, ‘If you’re in a helicopter and you hover why does the Earth not come to you if it’s round?‘Why, if we’re hurtling through space, why would water stay still? Why is it not wobbling? Also if you fire a laser about 16 miles, if the world was curved, you shouldn’t be able to see it but you can.’Freddie Flintoff is Flat-Earth curious (Picture: Getty Images)He even claims to be warming to the idea of a global conspiracy to conceal the truth (something that Flat Earthers are naturally very fond of).He said, ‘The middle is the North Pole, around the outside is the South Pole which is like a big wall of ice. This is why all governments now have bases on the South Pole.’Former reality show star and model Tila Tequila is perhaps less of a surprising Flat Earth believer – as she’s known for bizarre and disturbing behaviour.Tila Tequila (Picture: WireImage)She was thrown off Celebrity Big Brother after images surfaced of herself dressed as a scantily clad Nazi in front of an image of the Auschwitz death camp.She also wrote a blog post entitled, ‘Why I sympathise with Hitler.’She Tweeted questions about the Earth being round – asking why buildings in New York would stand straight up, rather than tilt, if Earth was flat.In one outburst, she said, ‘I WILL STOP MY #FLATEARTH TALK IF SOMEONE CAN SEND ME A GOD DAMN PHOTO OF THE HORIZON WITH A CURVATURE!’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/flick2.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;crop=1","title":"mcdonalds worker lashes flicked head customer","story":"A McDonald’s employee has been filmed attacking a woman in the store where she worked after she was flicked on the head.She can be seen hitting the woman several times and pulling her hair, even after security staff intervene.Man gives bullies a taste of their own medicine by lobbing eggs at themThings got heated when the customer started complaining about her food being late and ended up going behind the counter to remonstrate with staff.However, she then lashed out at the worker, flicking her at around 1am at a branch in Camberwell after a night out on Friday.The incident was filmed in Camberwell, South London, on April 28 at around 1am.The woman filming the incident, identified only as Antonia, said that the woman was eventually escorted out of the restaurant.A McDonald’s worker lashed out after she was flicked on the headShe said: ‘As I walked in to the McDonalds branch, the girl was already behind the counter.‘From what I could hear, the girl was upset that her and her friends’ order was taking too long so she decided to go behind the counter and get the food herself.’People have been struggling to open their umbrellas in the rainAntonia added: ‘After the incident, the worker got taken to the back of the store and the girl was escorted outside by the security guard.‘The girl was there for a further ten minutes insulting the security guard and causing a scene.

Her resignation letter said she ‘inadvertently misled’ parliament.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt will also take on Ms Rudd’s former responsibilities as Minister for Women and Equalities, Downing Street announced.It follows intense pressure for Ms Rudd to step down over the Windrush generation crisis, which saw people who came to the UK as citizens detained in immigration centres, denied healthcare and threatened with deportation.The Hastings and Rye MP became the fifth minister to leave the Cabinet since last year’s snap general election.Her resignation letter said she took ‘full responsibility’ for not being aware of the existence of targets.Mrs May said she was ‘very sorry’ to see her successor as home secretary leave the post, while Ms Rudd’s opposite number Diane Abbott said she had ‘done the right thing’.James Brokenshire becomes the new Communities and Local Government Secretary (Picture: PA)The pressure had been building on the former banker ever since the emergence of the ‘appalling’ treatment of Caribbean immigrants to the UK between the 1940s and 1970s – the so-called Windrush generation.Concerns had been raised about the immigration status of the Windrush generation and there had been stories of people being forced to prove their annual presence in the country for decades in order to prove they were here legally.Ms Rudd referred to the Windrush ‘scandal’ in her two-page resignation letter, admitting that people with a right to live in the UK had not always been treated ‘fairly and and humanely’.Opposition parties said she was paying the price for Mrs May’s ‘hostile environment’ policy towards illegal immigrants when she was Home Secretary which had led to people being wrongly stripped of their rights and threatened with deportation.Sajid Javid, left, with Amber Rudd, centre right (Picture: Getty)Diane Abbott said: ‘This was inevitable, the only surprise is that it took so long.‘The architect of this crisis, Theresa May, must now step forward to give a full and honest account of how this inexcusable situation happened on her watch.’Ms Rudd had appeared to be prepared to ride out the storm announcing her intention to come to the Commons on Monday to answer MPs’ ‘legitimate questions’ about the removals targets.She had previously apologised in the House for the ‘appalling’ treatment of the Windrush veterans, announcing a taskforce to resolve their immigration status as quickly as possible.However, she was criticised for saying the Home Office was ‘too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual’, prompting accusations that she was trying to put the blame on civil servants.Her resignation follow those of former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, Priti Patel as international development secretary, Damian Green as first minister and James Brokenshire, who left his role as Northern Ireland secretary on health grounds since June last year.Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents Home Office workers, said: ‘The Windrush scandal has highlighted how inhumane immigration policies coupled with cuts to Home Office staff and increased workloads is a recipe for disaster.‘The resignation of Amber Rudd should be a wake-up call to the Government to end the hostile environment they have created for people wanting to come to this country and to put a stop to the blame culture where Home Office staff carry the can for the failings of ministers.’MORE: Diane Abbott gets so much racist abuse her aides update police every weekMORE: Flood alerts issued as month’s worth of rain due to be dumped on Britain today"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/522060036.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"what does asda stand for","story":"Asda’s name is directly connected to how it was founded (Picture: Getty)Asda has just agreed to merge with Sainsbury’s to take on Tesco, with Walmart set to claim 42 per cent of the business.The billion-pound merger deal is just a bit bigger than the one which formed the basis of Asda some 53 years ago.That very deal gave Asda its unusual name, which unlike Sainsbury’s is not named after its founder (who was John James Sainsbury).So where does the name come from and what does it mean? Let’s find out.Associated Dairies Ltd was one half of the original Asda (Picture: Getty)Asda’s name comes from the two companies that came together and merged in 1965 after both first formed in the 1920s.Those firms were Associated Dairies and Farm Stores Ltd, and the supermarket Queens, run by the Asquith family, who were butchers from West Yorkshire.When the Asquith brothers Fred and Peter approached Associated Dairies to run the butchery departments within their small store chain, a merger was suggested.An early Asda store in the 1970s (Picture: Getty)The Asquiths chose to join together with Noel Stockdale, one of the West Riding dairy farmers in charge of the other company, to form a new company.They chose the name Asda, combining the name Asquith and the term Dairies from the two respective company titles.The logo was at first not capitalised in the logo and on the side of the supermarkets, which sprung up in the late 1960s and through the 1970s.Asda as we know it today, with a capitalised Logo (Picture: Getty)The logo became capitalised in 1985 when a new green logo was introduced in an effort to revitalise the brand image.Following the recession of the 1990s, Asda faced bankruptcy and was eventually bought by Walmart on 26 July 1999 for £6.7 billion, trumping a rival bid from Kingfisher plc.A panorama of an Asda interior (Picture: Wiki Commons)The chain then grew again, and the stores grew larger, echoing the Walmart stores of the States.The headquarters of the chain remain at Asda House, South Bank, Leeds, West Yorkshire an the current CEO is Roger Burnley.MORE: Twin Peaks star Pamela Gidley dead at 52MORE: Does the Royal Mail deliver post on Sundays?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/26/14/499AB2AB00000578-0-image-m-9_1519655967278.jpg","title":"Six tips secure pay rise","story":"    Many workers worry that they will tarnish their relationship with their boss if they ask for a riseLong-serving employees might even feel they are entitled to a financial reward for not jumping ship and remaining loyal to the company.Whatever the reason, mustering up the courage to ask for a raise is by no means an easy feat.How to nail a job interview outside the office comfort zone:...\u0027So, tell me about yourself\u0027: Experts reveal their top tips...What changes to auto-enrolment mean for small businesses -...I want to find out what my business is worth to maybe sell...Five tips to make the most of work experience: From how to...Why Sol Campbell is showing fraudsters the red card:...Should you hire a consultant to help you grow your business?...Share this articleHow to fund your brilliant business idea: Six ways to raise money to expand or start-upThe fear of unsettling your current work situation and falling out-of-favour with your boss might compel you to keep shtum and become increasingly bitter about the situation over time.However, it is possible to discuss pay without making things awkward - even if your boss says no.We asked James Reed, chairman of employment agency reed.co.uk, to list six top tips to negotiating a pay rise. Here is what he said.Six top tips to secure a pay rise Following a decade long pay squeeze in the UK, many people have felt the financial pressure of stagnating wages and rising living costs. Wage growth and inflation moved closer together in the first three months of this year, but for most this doesn’t mark the end of the pay squeeze just yet. With talk of inflation set to rise again this year, it’s not surprising that a growing number of people are concerned about salary.Our latest data from reed.co.uk revealed that average salaries advertised rose 3 per cent during the first quarter of 2018. This is a clear indication that salaries are finally moving in the right direction.What’s more, the requirement for companies to disclose their gender pay gaps has sparked a lot more conversations around salaries. Many women working for organisations reporting a large gender pay gap are questioning the remuneration they currently receive.Irrespective of any gender pay gap your employer has reported, you will still need to be able to demonstrate your successes and what you plan to contribute in future to make a case for a pay rise. This applies to men and women equally.  AskSchedule a time to meet with your manager and talk about your career goals, the contributions you’ve made to the company and the value you intend to bring in future.          To make a case for a pay rise, you should show your successes and what you plan to contribute in future according to James ReedBalance your request for a pay increase with a commitment to extra duties you’re prepared to fulfill. By showing your intent to demonstrate value to the company, you will provide assurance that this will be money well spent.Know your valueCome prepared. Research your worth based on your level of experience in the industry and the going rate for the same role. You can use salary checkers and job descriptions to research advertised salaries for your role. Gather as much comparative data as you can so you’re entering any discussion prepared.Prepare for additional responsibility Go above and beyond your duties in your current role. Your company isn’t going to award you a pay rise for nothing. Make sure you can show what extra value you’ll bring to the company, be it taking on more responsibilities, or bringing more expertise to your role.Make sure you never stop learningExpand your knowledge by completing a course or reading up on the news in your industry.Show that you have the right mindset to do the jobAround 97 per cent of employers we asked said they’d prefer an employee with the right mindset over one with the right skill set.Skills can be taught, but mindset is more difficult to change.Keep the negotiation professionalIf the answer is no, ask for a time to revisit the possibility of a pay rise in the future - six months is usually the ideal. Although it may be difficult to hide your disappointment, try not to get upset or angry in front of your boss. The decision may be out of your manager’s hands.One year fixed rateNo fees to use abroad £150 Expedia voucher to sign up"},{"url":null,"title":"When Ramadan 2018 Muslims fast does date change year","story":"Who was Johann Carl Friedrich Gauß?

Workshops will be run to give parents ‘simple, straightforward strategies’ which they can take home and use with pre-school children.Mr Hinds said last night: ‘We know there is a gap in child development that can be visible at age five. The easiest way to measure it is the “word gap”.‘Where you are, in development terms, at age five and at the start of school, obviously makes a significant difference to your ability to get the most out of infant school and then junior school education.’The OUP report found that when children arrive unable to understand basic phrases, they find it much harder to follow commands, make friends and learn how to read.

He added that he and wife Jacqui, a teacher, had enjoyed reading books with their three children. ‘Reading to children obviously makes a huge difference,’ he said. ‘Many, many parents spend an awful lot of time doing that.‘The important thing is to be reading, and to be giving feedback, and sitting together, and all of those things that parents dedicate so much time to.’Mr Hinds – who became Education Secretary in January, taking over from Justine Greening – said: ‘Schools do a great job on accelerating development. But it is still the case that with the differences that are discernible even at age five or sometimes even before, it is all too depressingly predictable what some of the later differences in attainment will be at 16 or 18.‘The earliest years are where there is the greatest leverage for improving social mobility and improving children’s opportunity to fulfil their potential.’          Experts say disadvantaged children are disproportionately affected by the growing problem (file photo)However, he said some parents – especially those juggling many different responsibilities or jobs – may be finding it hard to dedicate enough time to helping their children develop skills.He said: ‘It’s always hard for parents and, yes, there are extra pressures in the modern world. It is difficult. Parents know that, and that’s why it’s so important when you can find ways… for professionals to give hints and tips to make it easier – I think that’s something that parents can find very valuable.’Today Mr Hinds is launching a £5 million pilot scheme in the North of England to help parents teach their children vocabulary at home through reading and singing nursery rhymes. It will be run by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and will provide workshops in nurseries, community centres and homes. The projects found to be most effective could later be rolled out across the country.In addition, £8.5 million has been made available to councils across the country for language and literacy development projects for disadvantaged children.EEF chief executive Sir Kevan Collins said: ‘By testing different ways of tackling issues like the early years “word gap”, this new fund will give us much-needed information about how we can give parents the tools they need to give their child the very best start in life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/09/05D76DB9000003E8-0-image-a-27_1524038970727.jpg","title":"Murray swaps tennis strokes brush strokes","story":"    The two-time Wimbledon winner has picked up a brush while recovering from injuryThe father of two – whose wife Kim Sears paints pet portraits – is due to make a comeback soon after hip surgery in January.

In June 2008, international broadcasters were allowed to air the demolition of a cooling tower at the Nyongbyon reactor site, a year after the North reached an agreement with the U.S. and four other nations to disable its nuclear facilities in return for an aid package worth about $400 million.But the deal eventually collapsed after North Korea refused to accept U.S.-proposed verification methods, and the country went on to conduct its second nuclear test detonation in May 2009. Pompeo also said that at Trump\u0027s direction, he spoke with Kim about the release of three U.S. citizens detained by North Korea. He did not elaborate on the outcome of that discussion.Immigrant caravan sets up camp along the Mexican border...Share this article    North Korea invited the outside world to witness the dismantling of its nuclear facilities in June 2008.

Indeed, in what appeared to be an effort to crack a joke, self-deprecating Kim Jong-un told the South’s Mr Moon that he was sorry that the timing of the early morning missile test had led to him being woken up at an anti-social hour.This sudden change in mood music raises an intriguing question: could this young despot might be positioning himself as his region’s version of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist leader whose overtures to the West helped bring about the end of the Cold War?Of course, reading tea-leaves from Pyongyang is often a mug’s game, given that little is known regarding even very basic details of life inside the secretive far-Left dictatorship. The country is largely closed to foreign reporters and visitors, aside from those who visit on closely chaperoned tours, and foreign diplomats have little access to reliable intelligence.There is no free press, and the country’s version of the internet, the kwangmyong, which is largely used by academics and civil servants, reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Kim Jong Un that he...Dennis Rodman claims he\u0027s responsible for easing tension...Share this articleYet what little we do know about Kim Jong-un suggests that his life has given him far more of an understanding of Western values than either his immediate predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, or his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1948 until his death in 1994.Crucial in this context is the fact that, aged 15, Jong-un was sent to an exclusive international college near Berne in Switzerland, before moving to the nearby Liebefeld-Steinholzli state school.Living there under a pseudonym, Un Pak, he was described to classmates as the son of a diplomat.Though apparently displaying little academic prowess, he developed a lifelong passion for Disney films and basketball, becoming a supporter of the pre-eminent U.S. team of the era, the Chicago Bulls.The team’s former star player Dennis Rodman has in recent years conducted several high-profile visits to Pyongyang.Nowadays a reality TV personality, with multiple tattoos and piercings, Rodman was almost certainly paid for the privilege.          \u0027U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said there was now real opportunity for a nuclear deal\u0027However there was also some truth in the suggestion that, as he put it, the visits helped to ‘break the ice’ between the nations. The Washington Post newspaper went so far last year as to speculate that Trump had given a 2017 visit his blessing, as a way to open a channel of communication between the countries.Aside from basketball, the young Kim Jong-un is said to have developed a passion for ‘rosti’ – the calorie-laden Swiss national potato dish in the style of a fritter, which contributed to his subsequent obesity — and spent plenty of time on his host nation’s ski slopes.Perhaps that explains why he has not only recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass — a new multi-million-pound ski resort — but was also anxious to send a large delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics, which were held in the South. A large orchestra, and squad of cheerleaders, turned out to support the North Korean team, while several diplomats met their counterparts from over the border, helping build momentum for last week’s summit.          \u0027Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons\u0027Time in the West also gave Kim Jong-un a far more cultured manner than his father, who was almost never heard speaking publicly (TV tended to voiceover images of his addresses), and whose absurdly-shrill real voice was only revealed when tape recordings were leaked of his calls to a kidnapped South Korean actress he was obsessed with.As a result, Kim Jong-un’s address on Friday, at which he described the two Koreas as ‘one nation’ who would in future ‘share in prosperity’ was confidently delivered.His wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons.Another key factor behind Kim Jong-Un’s sudden conversion to the pursuit of peace is likely to be straightforward pragmatism.Indeed, there are those who believe that, rather from being hot headed and impulsive, he is actually a calculating premier. To thisend, it’s worth noting that when he took office in 2011, at the tender age of 29, Kim Jong-un promised to bring his people prosperity and give their nation status as a nuclear power.Years of sanctions have since crippled North Korea’s economy, with its entire annual GDP of $40 billion coming in at under 2 per cent that of the South. Though it has been partly propped up by China, that support is thought to have evaporated after recent missile tests, with Beijing anxious to avoid economic refugees heading over its border.Abandoning nuclear ambitions will therefore give Kim Jong-un a sporting chance of keeping at least one of his promises.Indeed reports from Friday’s state dinner with the South suggest that — having put away a few glasses of champagne — he somewhat unexpectedly confessed that he was ‘embarrassed’ by his nation’s ‘poor infrastructure’ and determined to do something about it.That could just be the drink talking (there is some suggestion that he looked ‘bleary eyed’ during the meal) but it seems apparent even a mild thaw in relations will at this stage serve the interest of almost every player in the region, and also the U.S. (since Mr Trump can present it as a diplomatic triumph).In the longer term, of course, the big question is whether Kim Jong-un will actually keep his promises of nuclear disarmament.A decade ago, for example, foreign journalists were invited to watch his regime destroying a nuclear reactor cooling tower, in an effort to stave off sanctions. Yet it later turned out that, behind the scenes, they were already building a second facility.This time, cynics wonder if something similar is afoot. Indeed some analysts believe that the Punggye-ri underground test site, which he has so graciously pledged to publicly destroy, is in fact already useless because previous tests have caused structural damage.Mr Kim of course insists otherwise, using Friday’s State banquet to inform the South that the facility contains at least two tunnels which are currently in ‘good condition’. And so the ‘Rocket Man’ continues to rebrand himself as a man of peace — while the world prays he’s telling the truth. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/02/4BB17C5B00000578-5672605-The_homestead_s_eerie_history_which_involves_a_number_of_deaths_-a-29_1525053143896.jpg","title":"Haunted tourist attraction scary visitors Australia","story":"    Oakabella Homestead, in the Western Australian countryside, has been forced to reconsider its marketing strategy in order to make itself less scary to potential visitors\u0027There are some articles we have read online and it is quite interesting to read the feedback,\u0027 said Ms Turner.\u0027Not everyone is into ghosts and that was definitely portrayed in the Facebook comments.\u0027People will not come here if they think it is haunted so that is why we are bringing it back to the history.\u0027          The homestead\u0027s eerie history - which involves a number of deaths at the site, and was previously exploited in the form of ghost tours - was keeping a lot of tourists awayThe new business model will aim to portray Oakabella Homestead less as a haunt of unruly spirits and more a place of endless horizons and rich Australian history.Stargazing, campfires and traditional bush tucker are just a few of the things in the revamped purview.\u0027We ourselves are more passionate about the history side of things,\u0027 said Mr Snelson.\u0027The spiritual ghost side of things is something we are a bit less believing in.\u0027           The notion of ghosts and spirits was proving a particularly hard sell for Chinese tourists          New business owners Belinda Turner and Brian Snelson are trying to reinvent the homestead\u0027s image, focusing on the location\u0027s heritage history, great outdoors and starry skies The issue, of course, is that not everyone seemed to be taking these tales of terror so lightly.Haunted homesteads can prove a tough sell for anyone with even the slightest of superstitions - and Chinese tourists in particular were steering clear of Oakabella.\u0027I am Chinese and I have lived in Australia but if you tell me that this place is the most haunted estate then I would be scared,\u0027 said Hanjie Davis, economic development officer for the City of Greater Geraldton. \u0027If you have ghosts, my first impression is that I don\u0027t want to go there. Don\u0027t forget your Geiger counter!

It will begin removing the speakers on Tuesday.\u0027We see this as the easiest first step to build military trust,\u0027 South Korean defence ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo said. \u0027We are expecting the North\u0027s implementation.\u0027North Korea will shift its time zone 30 minutes earlier to align with South Korea, starting May 5, state media reported on Monday.The KCNA dispatch said the decision came after Kim found it \u0027a painful wrench\u0027 to see two clocks showing different times on a wall at the summit venue.The northern time zone was created in 2015 to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea\u0027s liberation from Japanese rule after World War Two.

In 1965, Reggie married Frances Shea, but the union only lasted a few months and she died in 1967, apparently from suicide but it was rumoured that Ronnie murdered herIn 1965, Reggie married Frances Shea, but the union only lasted a few months and she died in 1967, apparently from suicide but it was rumoured that Ronnie murdered her.The police frequently investigated the twins\u0027 activities, but with the East End living in fear of the notorious twins, no-one dared testify against them, so their misdemeanours often went unchallenged.          In 1967, Reggie Kray murdered former gang member Jack \u0027The Hat\u0027 Mcvitie, stabbing him in the face and stomach with a carving knifeThe Firm then largely consisted of the brothers, their cousin, Albert Donoghue, and at least 13 others, including brothers Tony and Chris Lambrianou.In 1966, the Krays helped Frank Mitchell, also known as The Mad Axeman, escape from Dartmoor Prison, and put him up at a friend\u0027s flat in East Ham. He subsequently disappeared, and while the brothers were acquitted of his murder, a later book claimed that he had been shot.The same year, Ronnie shot George Cornell dead in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel. Cornell, an associate of South London gang, the Richardsons, is said to have remarked: \u0027Well look who\u0027s here\u0027 just before he was shot.And in 1967, Reggie Kray murdered former gang member Jack \u0027The Hat\u0027 Mcvitie in Stoke Newington, stabbing him in the face and stomach with a carving knife, twisting the knife as McVitie lay dying.The brothers were finally brought to justice in the middle of 1968, when they and several members of The Firm were arrested, and both brothers given life sentences with no chance of parole for 30 years.The judge, Mr Justice Melford Stevenson, told them: \u0027In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.\u0027They were allowed out of prison for their mother\u0027s funeral in 1982, but Ronnie died in Broadmoor, aged 61 in 1995, and Reggie, died at 66, in 2000, a few weeks after being allowed out on compassionate leave.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/22/01E01DD0000004B0-0-image-m-110_1524950769198.jpg","title":"Youll need plenty chips Halibut weighing 15 stones caught North Sea","story":"    The halibut weighing 95 kilograms - or 210 Ilbs was caught in the North Sea off Scotland.

Here is what he said.Six top tips to secure a pay rise Following a decade long pay squeeze in the UK, many people have felt the financial pressure of stagnating wages and rising living costs. Wage growth and inflation moved closer together in the first three months of this year, but for most this doesn’t mark the end of the pay squeeze just yet. With talk of inflation set to rise again this year, it’s not surprising that a growing number of people are concerned about salary.Our latest data from reed.co.uk revealed that average salaries advertised rose 3 per cent during the first quarter of 2018. This is a clear indication that salaries are finally moving in the right direction.What’s more, the requirement for companies to disclose their gender pay gaps has sparked a lot more conversations around salaries. Many women working for organisations reporting a large gender pay gap are questioning the remuneration they currently receive.Irrespective of any gender pay gap your employer has reported, you will still need to be able to demonstrate your successes and what you plan to contribute in future to make a case for a pay rise. This applies to men and women equally.  AskSchedule a time to meet with your manager and talk about your career goals, the contributions you’ve made to the company and the value you intend to bring in future.          To make a case for a pay rise, you should show your successes and what you plan to contribute in future according to James ReedBalance your request for a pay increase with a commitment to extra duties you’re prepared to fulfill. By showing your intent to demonstrate value to the company, you will provide assurance that this will be money well spent.Know your valueCome prepared. Research your worth based on your level of experience in the industry and the going rate for the same role. You can use salary checkers and job descriptions to research advertised salaries for your role. Gather as much comparative data as you can so you’re entering any discussion prepared.Prepare for additional responsibility Go above and beyond your duties in your current role. Your company isn’t going to award you a pay rise for nothing. Make sure you can show what extra value you’ll bring to the company, be it taking on more responsibilities, or bringing more expertise to your role.Make sure you never stop learningExpand your knowledge by completing a course or reading up on the news in your industry.Show that you have the right mindset to do the jobAround 97 per cent of employers we asked said they’d prefer an employee with the right mindset over one with the right skill set.Skills can be taught, but mindset is more difficult to change.Keep the negotiation professionalIf the answer is no, ask for a time to revisit the possibility of a pay rise in the future - six months is usually the ideal. Although it may be difficult to hide your disappointment, try not to get upset or angry in front of your boss. The decision may be out of your manager’s hands.One year fixed rateNo fees to use abroad £150 Expedia voucher to sign up"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/08/4BAB44AD00000578-0-image-m-10_1524987218797.jpg","title":"UK legalise cannabis five years say tycoons","story":"    Investors are already setting their sights on the UK as a potential new market with experts meeting to talk over plansMany of those presenting were from Canada with the country set to make recreational use of the drug fully legal by September this year, report Metro.co.uk.Max Zavet, founder of Canadian cannabis company Emblem, said: ‘We are very, very eager to get into the UK market.’Police \u0027free three slaves\u0027 when they stop more than 80...Alfie Evans\u0027 father spent last 10 minutes of his son\u0027s life...Share this articleEmblem is one of 14 companies who were at the Cannabis Invest conference at the May Fair Hotel.Mr Zavet believes there is a global shift of opinion happening towards the drug and that the UK government will soon have to catch up.

Workshops will be run to give parents ‘simple, straightforward strategies’ which they can take home and use with pre-school children.Mr Hinds said last night: ‘We know there is a gap in child development that can be visible at age five. The easiest way to measure it is the “word gap”.‘Where you are, in development terms, at age five and at the start of school, obviously makes a significant difference to your ability to get the most out of infant school and then junior school education.’The OUP report found that when children arrive unable to understand basic phrases, they find it much harder to follow commands, make friends and learn how to read.

He added that he and wife Jacqui, a teacher, had enjoyed reading books with their three children. ‘Reading to children obviously makes a huge difference,’ he said. ‘Many, many parents spend an awful lot of time doing that.‘The important thing is to be reading, and to be giving feedback, and sitting together, and all of those things that parents dedicate so much time to.’Mr Hinds – who became Education Secretary in January, taking over from Justine Greening – said: ‘Schools do a great job on accelerating development. But it is still the case that with the differences that are discernible even at age five or sometimes even before, it is all too depressingly predictable what some of the later differences in attainment will be at 16 or 18.‘The earliest years are where there is the greatest leverage for improving social mobility and improving children’s opportunity to fulfil their potential.’          Experts say disadvantaged children are disproportionately affected by the growing problem (file photo)However, he said some parents – especially those juggling many different responsibilities or jobs – may be finding it hard to dedicate enough time to helping their children develop skills.He said: ‘It’s always hard for parents and, yes, there are extra pressures in the modern world. It is difficult. Parents know that, and that’s why it’s so important when you can find ways… for professionals to give hints and tips to make it easier – I think that’s something that parents can find very valuable.’Today Mr Hinds is launching a £5 million pilot scheme in the North of England to help parents teach their children vocabulary at home through reading and singing nursery rhymes. It will be run by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and will provide workshops in nurseries, community centres and homes. The projects found to be most effective could later be rolled out across the country.In addition, £8.5 million has been made available to councils across the country for language and literacy development projects for disadvantaged children.EEF chief executive Sir Kevan Collins said: ‘By testing different ways of tackling issues like the early years “word gap”, this new fund will give us much-needed information about how we can give parents the tools they need to give their child the very best start in life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/01/4BAF93C000000578-5672113-image-a-47_1525049401960.jpg","title":"Disturbing dairy farm footage shows apparently emaciated calves","story":"    A calf at Halswell Farm in south Devon, apparently emaciated with an injured back leg making it barely able to walk          A cow at the farm hobbles around with its head lowered, seemingly injuredThe latter is among hundreds of farms that supply milk to supermarkets and for many top brands.Some cows on both farms have their rear legs shackled together to prevent them from splaying, causing serious injury, when delivering calves.The footage was taken by campaigning group Viva, which is opposed to the consumption of meat and dairy products. It claims the scenes are typical of modern dairy farming.The organisation says the cows are bred to be ‘udders on legs’ and claims many suffer problems with their legs and feet as well as udder infections.The last hours of a gentle giant tortured to death: Shocking...Don\u0027t mess with my Mum!

There was quite a lot of bruising around and suffering.’Footage also showed calves in small hutches, each one surrounded by a metal fence. Farmers can take newborn calves from their mothers to these hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives. But Viva said ear-tag data suggested these calves were 16 weeks old and too big for the hutches, breaching welfare rules.A few miles away in south Devon is Halswell Farm, part of the Arla dairy organisation. It is the UK’s second largest dairy firm supplying milk to supermarkets and owns popular brands such as Cravendale and Anchor butter.At Halswell, Viva found an old, apparently emaciated cow with an injured back leg that was barely able to walk. Miss Gellatley added: ‘There were also countless examples of shockingly oversized and distorted udders.’ Viva has complained about both farms to the watchdog for farm animal welfare, the Animal \u0026amp Plant Health Agency. But the Carpenter family’s solicitors, Clarke Willmott, said a vet had examined its cows on April 19.It said ‘no animal welfare issues were identified’. And it described the claims as ‘vague’ and ‘inaccurate’, denying cows were emaciated.Arla issued a statement on behalf of itself and Halswell Farm, which is part of the Red Tractor scheme, which means it is independently inspected. It said: ‘Over 2,400 farmers are part of the farmer-owned Arla Foods. This footage is not representative of their farming methods or their approach to animal welfare.’ It added: ‘This farm was visited by an independent vet and Red Tractor and there were no immediate welfare concerns from either independent party.’Michael Oakes, of the National Farmers Union, said: ‘The reality is animals, just like humans, can occasionally receive injuries or be treated for different conditions.

Indeed, in what appeared to be an effort to crack a joke, self-deprecating Kim Jong-un told the South’s Mr Moon that he was sorry that the timing of the early morning missile test had led to him being woken up at an anti-social hour.This sudden change in mood music raises an intriguing question: could this young despot might be positioning himself as his region’s version of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist leader whose overtures to the West helped bring about the end of the Cold War?Of course, reading tea-leaves from Pyongyang is often a mug’s game, given that little is known regarding even very basic details of life inside the secretive far-Left dictatorship. The country is largely closed to foreign reporters and visitors, aside from those who visit on closely chaperoned tours, and foreign diplomats have little access to reliable intelligence.There is no free press, and the country’s version of the internet, the kwangmyong, which is largely used by academics and civil servants, reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Kim Jong Un that he...Dennis Rodman claims he\u0027s responsible for easing tension...Share this articleYet what little we do know about Kim Jong-un suggests that his life has given him far more of an understanding of Western values than either his immediate predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, or his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1948 until his death in 1994.Crucial in this context is the fact that, aged 15, Jong-un was sent to an exclusive international college near Berne in Switzerland, before moving to the nearby Liebefeld-Steinholzli state school.Living there under a pseudonym, Un Pak, he was described to classmates as the son of a diplomat.Though apparently displaying little academic prowess, he developed a lifelong passion for Disney films and basketball, becoming a supporter of the pre-eminent U.S. team of the era, the Chicago Bulls.The team’s former star player Dennis Rodman has in recent years conducted several high-profile visits to Pyongyang.Nowadays a reality TV personality, with multiple tattoos and piercings, Rodman was almost certainly paid for the privilege.          \u0027U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said there was now real opportunity for a nuclear deal\u0027However there was also some truth in the suggestion that, as he put it, the visits helped to ‘break the ice’ between the nations. The Washington Post newspaper went so far last year as to speculate that Trump had given a 2017 visit his blessing, as a way to open a channel of communication between the countries.Aside from basketball, the young Kim Jong-un is said to have developed a passion for ‘rosti’ – the calorie-laden Swiss national potato dish in the style of a fritter, which contributed to his subsequent obesity — and spent plenty of time on his host nation’s ski slopes.Perhaps that explains why he has not only recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass — a new multi-million-pound ski resort — but was also anxious to send a large delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics, which were held in the South. A large orchestra, and squad of cheerleaders, turned out to support the North Korean team, while several diplomats met their counterparts from over the border, helping build momentum for last week’s summit.          \u0027Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons\u0027Time in the West also gave Kim Jong-un a far more cultured manner than his father, who was almost never heard speaking publicly (TV tended to voiceover images of his addresses), and whose absurdly-shrill real voice was only revealed when tape recordings were leaked of his calls to a kidnapped South Korean actress he was obsessed with.As a result, Kim Jong-un’s address on Friday, at which he described the two Koreas as ‘one nation’ who would in future ‘share in prosperity’ was confidently delivered.His wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons.Another key factor behind Kim Jong-Un’s sudden conversion to the pursuit of peace is likely to be straightforward pragmatism.Indeed, there are those who believe that, rather from being hot headed and impulsive, he is actually a calculating premier. To thisend, it’s worth noting that when he took office in 2011, at the tender age of 29, Kim Jong-un promised to bring his people prosperity and give their nation status as a nuclear power.Years of sanctions have since crippled North Korea’s economy, with its entire annual GDP of $40 billion coming in at under 2 per cent that of the South. Though it has been partly propped up by China, that support is thought to have evaporated after recent missile tests, with Beijing anxious to avoid economic refugees heading over its border.Abandoning nuclear ambitions will therefore give Kim Jong-un a sporting chance of keeping at least one of his promises.Indeed reports from Friday’s state dinner with the South suggest that — having put away a few glasses of champagne — he somewhat unexpectedly confessed that he was ‘embarrassed’ by his nation’s ‘poor infrastructure’ and determined to do something about it.That could just be the drink talking (there is some suggestion that he looked ‘bleary eyed’ during the meal) but it seems apparent even a mild thaw in relations will at this stage serve the interest of almost every player in the region, and also the U.S. (since Mr Trump can present it as a diplomatic triumph).In the longer term, of course, the big question is whether Kim Jong-un will actually keep his promises of nuclear disarmament.A decade ago, for example, foreign journalists were invited to watch his regime destroying a nuclear reactor cooling tower, in an effort to stave off sanctions. Yet it later turned out that, behind the scenes, they were already building a second facility.This time, cynics wonder if something similar is afoot. Indeed some analysts believe that the Punggye-ri underground test site, which he has so graciously pledged to publicly destroy, is in fact already useless because previous tests have caused structural damage.Mr Kim of course insists otherwise, using Friday’s State banquet to inform the South that the facility contains at least two tunnels which are currently in ‘good condition’. And so the ‘Rocket Man’ continues to rebrand himself as a man of peace — while the world prays he’s telling the truth. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/04/4BAEF1D600000578-5672651-The_New_Shepard_Rocket_launching_on_its_eighth_overall_test_flig-a-3_1525059567017.jpg","title":"Jeff Bezos Blue Origin launches Mission 8 New Shepherd rocket smooth test flight Texas","story":"    Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, successfully launched its eighth rocket test flight from West Texas on Sunday Bezos is shown here at the unveiling of the Blue Origin New Shepard system during the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on April 5, 2017\u0027Mannequin Skywalker is ready for his 2nd mission on board New Shepard.

It says Seoul expects Pyongyang to do the same.South Korea had turned off its loudspeakers ahead of Friday\u0027s summit talks, and North Korea responded by halting its own broadcasts.Seoul had blasted propaganda messages and K-pop songs from border loudspeakers since the North\u0027s fourth nuclear test in early 2016. The North quickly matched the South\u0027s action with its own border broadcasts.Also on Monday, China\u0027s foreign ministry said it will send the government\u0027s top diplomat, Wang Yi, to visit North Korea on Wednesday and Thursday this week.South Korean  loudspeakers used for propaganda near the DMZ are seen in a file photo.

Over the Moon: President Moon is applauded by his senior secretaries during a meeting with them at the presidential office in Seoul on Monday on his first day back after the summit\u0027Denuclearising is definitely possible,\u0027 said 41-year-old Kim Jin-han. \u0027He talked about his country\u0027s weaknesses, such as the infrastructure. He was very open about that. This is very different from the previous leaders. So I think he is ready to wholly give up nuclear weapons.\u0027 A euphoric mood enveloped the presidential Blue House on Monday as Moon was greeted by cheers and a standing ovation by scores of aides and staff.\u0027I am confident a new era of peace will unfold on the Korean peninsula,\u0027 Moon told his aides, asking them to quickly follow up on the agreements made in Friday\u0027s declaration.The two sides are technically still at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty.Moon\u0027s approval rating after the summit rose to 70 percent, Realmeter said, its highest since mid-January.Moon also told aides that U.S. President Donald Trump deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for helping to end the standoff with North Korea over its nuclear weapons programme, a South Korean official said.\u0027President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize. What we need is only peace,\u0027 Moon told aides, according to a Blue House official who briefed the press.In January, Moon had said Trump \u0027deserves big credit\u0027 for bringing about the inter-Korean talks, saying it may have come from \u0027U.S.-led sanctions and pressure.\u0027Friday\u0027s final declaration, however, leaves many questions unanswered, particularly what \u0027denuclearisation\u0027 means or how that will be achieved. Much hinges on Kim\u0027s upcoming summit with Trump, who said it could happen in the next three to four weeks.Any deal with the United States will require that North Korea demonstrate \u0027irreversible\u0027 steps to shutting down its nuclear weapons programme, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.A flurry of diplomacy is unfolding in the lead-up to that meeting, with China saying it will send the government\u0027s top diplomat, Wang Yi, to North Korea on Wednesday and Thursday this week. China is the North\u0027s main ally.          More changes: South Korea says it will remove propaganda-broadcasting loudspeakers from the tense border with North Korea (file photo)And over the weekend, South Korea\u0027s spy chief visited Tokyo to brief Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.In initial small steps towards reconciliation, South Korea said on Monday it would remove loudspeakers that blared propaganda across the border, while North Korea said it would shift its clocks to align with its southern neighbour.South Korea turned off the loudspeakers that broadcast a mixture of news, Korean pop songs and criticism of the North Korean regime as a goodwill gesture ahead of the summit. It will begin removing the speakers on Tuesday.\u0027We see this as the easiest first step to build military trust,\u0027 South Korean defence ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo said. \u0027We are expecting the North\u0027s implementation.\u0027North Korea will shift its time zone 30 minutes earlier to align with South Korea, starting May 5, state media reported on Monday.The KCNA dispatch said the decision came after Kim found it \u0027a painful wrench\u0027 to see two clocks showing different times on a wall at the summit venue.The northern time zone was created in 2015 to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea\u0027s liberation from Japanese rule after World War Two. South Korea and Japan are in the same time zone, nine hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time.Kim also told Moon during the summit he would soon invite experts and journalists from the United States and South Korea when the country dismantles its Punggye-ri nuclear testing site, the Blue House said on Sunday.North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the site, a series of tunnels dug into the mountains in the northeastern part of the country.

They said life-support treatment should stop.Mr Justice Francis ruled in favour of Great Ormond Street and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity.Charlie\u0027s parents subsequently failed to overturn his ruling in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in London. They also failed to persuade European Court of Human Rights judges to intervene.\u0027With heavy hearts we have watched as Alfie\u0027s case has unfolded,\u0027 said Ms Yates, in a statement posted on Facebook.\u0027For those who have not been in a situation like this, it is impossible to understand the pain Tom and Kate are going through.\u0027When we were fighting for our son, Charlie Gard to be given a chance to try a treatment that could have improved his quality of life, we realised that cases like these would keep happening until the law was changed.\u0027Tragically, this has proven to be true.\u0027Since Charlie\u0027s passing in July last year, we have been working with paediatric consultants, medical ethicists, senior lawyers, UK politicians and other parents who have suffered through similar situations as us, to try and propose a law that will prevent parents experiencing painful and prolonged conflicts with medical professionals.\u0027This involves addressing problems around the \u0027best interests\u0027 test as well as creating a platform for transparency and openness so that cases like these can be dealt with before they ever reach the courts.\u0027A foundation set up by Charlie\u0027s parents is due to be launched in a few weeks\u0027 time.

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

It was Pound who introduced him to vorticism, the short-lived British avant garde modernist movement created by artist and writer Wyndham Lewis as a reaction to the dominance of landscape and figurative art. Equally frustrated by the representative nature of photography, Langdon Coburn immediately sensed the liberating potential of the vorticist dynamic of geometric shapes and cubist fragmentation. In the Shape of Light, Langdon Coburn’s “vortographs”, blurred geometric arrangements of light and shadow, made using a set of mirrors to fragment the subject in an almost kaleidoscopic way, set the tone for an epic exhibition that traces the history of photography as experiment. Here, portraiture, landscape and documentary give way to abstractions – created either by manipulations of light and chemicals or by distorting or fragmenting the actual world. The result is a kind of mirror-history of the medium’s relationship to documentary and abstract art.  Spread over 12 rooms, Shape of Light is also a history of innovation, in which the darkroom and the studio are more akin to the laboratory. The early-to-mid-century masters of light and form are all present: Brassaï, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, their embrace of abstraction a kind of compliment to their more traditional documentary work. Their often stark monochrome photographs are contrasted with the formalist paintings of Braque and Kandinsky as well as the shiny curves of a gold Brancusi sculpture, Maiastra (1911), which Steichen must surely have been aware of when he made his oddly mystical study, Bird in Space, 15 years later. It is instructive, too, to see an image from Germaine Krull’s still-undervalued series Métal (1928), a hymn to the angularity and materiality of steel, and to contrast it with the cleaner lines of Margaret Bourke-White’s ground-level view of the NBC Transmission Tower (1934). In a room entitled New Vision, the work of the great self-taught Hungarian modernist, László Moholy-Nagy, inevitably dominates. His painting K VII (1922), a minimalist arrangement of lines and blocks of colour, is echoed in an untitled photograph by him from the same year and, much later, in Mondrian’s supremely ordered arrangement of colour and form, Composition C (No 111) With Red, Yellow, Blue from 1935. Similarly in the following two rooms, the restlessly innovative imagination of Man Ray makes its presence felt. One of his mysterious rayographs from 1922 is an early example of camera-less photography made by placing everyday objects directly on to photosensitised paper and exposing them to light.Both artists cast a long shadow: Moholy-Nagy in his architectural understanding of scale, angle and detail, and his subversion of the same Man Ray in his seemingly instinctive grasp of photography as an essentially surrealist medium, capable of bending the real out of shape in astonishing ways. Bafflingly, though, there is not a trace of one of photography’s great female pioneers, Berenice Abbott, who made formally brilliant architectural photographs of modernist New York as well as pioneering scientific images of great beauty – including what she called her “rayograms-in-motion” – that surely deserved inclusion here.  In a show that tends towards the cerebral, it is a relief to encounter some more tactile nudes by Brassaï and Imogen Cunningham, in which the curves and surfaces of the female body retain a palpable sensuality. Bill Brandt’s distorted female forms, though, seem a little too forced in comparison. All three of the aforementioned artists could have featured in room eight, which is titled Surface and Texture. It begins with three images from Brassaï’s Graffiti series, in which he photographed anonymous carvings and etchings made on the walls of Paris, some recognisably representational, some abstract, all seeming to hark back to older forms of expression such as cave drawings. More intriguing still are Aaron Siskind’s photographs of cracked, peeling paint on weathered surfaces, which possess a tangible sense of materiality and a tonal quality that speaks of time passing and, with it, the slow, inexorable decay of buildings, objects and those who created them.  This is an exhibition that demands a constant attentiveness to detail and, as such, will repay a second or even third visit. The sheer amount of work on display is at times overwhelming and here and there the endless riffs on angular shapes, circles and patterns of light began to blur into a long series of slight variations on a single brilliant idea. In this context, Lewis Baltz’s almost blank minimalism is a much-needed breathing space. His evocation of the banality of postwar suburban American architecture – grey concrete surfaces in small frames – has a social, even political, undertow in that it draws attention in its deadpan way to the spread of these soulless environments. This is the mundane made abstract.  The final room is given over to contemporary abstraction and, perhaps inevitably, reflects the dilemma of current photographic practice in our profligate image culture. Both Maya Rochat and Daisuke Yokota, in their differing ways, subject their images to intense, almost destructive, transformative techniques using chemicals, heat, paint and, in Daisuke’s case, constant rephotographing, reprinting and rescanning. The visceral nature of their approach both degrades and heightens the photographic image and, by extension, the very idea of photography as a recording medium. The end results are images that are, among other things, traces of a process that is akin to improvisational music insofar as it allows, even thrives on, spontaneity and accident.  London-based Antony Cairns produces traces of a different kind, his shadow-images of London at night emanating an almost ghostly atmosphere that is both Ballardian and oddly Victorian. His silver gelatin prints are shown here behind glass plates in a large grid, each one a glimpse of a cityscape, indistinct yet recognisable, familiar yet unknowable. The ghosts of photography’s past haunt these images: the monochrome textures and shadowlands of Strand, Stieglitz, Steichen and Brassaï – the flaneurs and psychogeographers of another time who sensed the medium’s singular possibilities, not just to reflect the real, but to transform it into another kind of abstract art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/765f2dcdd73ebcc0436b6ee3fa59c9402ff7c931/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f83052e1e4a714521ff753ebe83e96e","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The Korean summit, the Bill Cosby verdict, the anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and demonstrations in Gaza – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3412856a2112e78557dd9d851b5e72747dfe9f6b/0_96_2750_1651/master/2750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c732c4af2122df21d96b0c90b9538d","title":"sainsburys prices asda merger deal uk supermarket","story":"Retailers say they plan no store closures as they unveil deal to create UK’s biggest supermarket chainThe companies said there were no planned store closures as a result of the deal which would value Asda at £7.3bn, maintaining both retail brands in a network of more than 2,800 stores.But Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe confirmed that some stores could be sold off to rival supermarkets to meet competition regulator requirements.The merger of the UK’s second and third largest retailers is expected to trigger a major inquiry which analysts predict will result in at least 75 stores having to be disposed of. It would be the biggest shake-up in the market since the merger of Morrison and Safeway in 2003 when dozens of stores changed hands.Sainsbury’s takeover of Asda is not expected to complete until the second half of next year as regulators crunch the numbers on potential overlap between the two groups’ stores. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury’s chief executive who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a “transformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future”.Coupe said the retail landscape had changed dramatically since 2003, with more competition from the likes of Amazon, Aldi and Lidl.“Online grocery shopping didn’t exist in 2003 and neither was there the presence of discounters or convenience stores more broadly,” Coupe said. The CMA confirmed on Monday that the deal would be subject to investigation and Sainsbury’s said it had asked the regulator to skip straight to the “phase two” detailed stage of investigation.Coupe said regulators would be mainly concerned by the benefits for customers, which would include lower prices and more choice about how they shopped as a result of investment in technology. He said the merger would deliver at least £500m in cost savings and other benefits, largely as a result of improved efficiency and better deals with suppliers. Putting Argos outlets into Asda stores is expected to bring about £75m of those benefits.Unions have expressed concerns about potential job cuts. But Coupe said jobs would be created and Asda would continue to be run from Leeds with its own chief executive, likely to be current boss Roger Burnley, who only recently joined Asda from Sainsbury’s.Sainsbury’s said the board of the combined group would be headed by its chairman. But the supermarket confirmed separately that it had begun a hunt to replace its current chairman, David Tyler, who has been in post for eight years.Coupe said the merger would “create a business that is more dynamic, more adaptable, more resilient and an even bigger contributor to the UK economy”. “Having worked at Asda before Sainsbury’s,” he added, “I understand the culture and the businesses well and believe they are the best possible fit. This creates a great deal for customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders and I am excited about the opportunities ahead and what we can achieve together.” He insisted that the Sainsbury’s brand, which has prided itself on better welfare and food quality standards, would not be damaged by association with Walmart, an international retail giant best known for its low prices.The deal will be seen as a way for Walmart, which bought Asda nearly 20 years ago, to take a step back from the UK market where it is struggling to compete with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket chain which controls almost a third of the grocery market.But in a statement issued on Monday morning, Sainsbury’s said Walmart would remain a long-term shareholder in the combined group with two representatives on its board. Judith McKenna, the chief executive of Walmart International, said: “We believe this combination will create a dynamic new retail player better positioned for even more success in a fast-changing and competitive UK market.”She said Walmart was interested in expanding Sainsbury’s Argos chain internationally and could help the combined business by introducing new technology and better deals on non-food goods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33749d7cee84da42c5e514e4a78612c0d24a74de/0_32_4576_2746/master/4576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45d75bc0fe3cf1bcb723719b25523df1","title":"tsb online banking internet business it","story":"Customers still facing problems with internet and business services after bungled IT upgradeTSB’s IT meltdown has entered its second week, with some customers still unable to access their accounts or make payments.One of the worst crises in British banking was caused by a botched migration of data from one IT system to another and has affected up to 1.9 million mobile and online banking customers at the Spanish-owned bank.

It is about a burning injustice that stretches from 10 Downing Street into the lives of thousands of British citizens. At its heart the Windrush crisis is about an immigration policy that was allowed to – even designed to – dehumanise, demonise and victimise British citizens.It is right that Amber Rudd has gone. She had lost control of what was going on in the Home Office and lost the confidence of her own civil servants.But the real issue is the hostile environment policy that caused this crisis in the first place, and her resignation must not distract from this fact. Each Windrush story is the hostile environment policy personified and writ large. Each case is directly linked to a policy that ignores the principle of habeas corpus by imprisoning innocent people without reference to a judge, jury or evidence of guilt. It is this policy that barred British citizens from accessing the public services and benefits that they themselves built with their own hands, staffed and paid for. It is this policy that turned employers, doctors, landlords and social workers into border guards.Described from the outset by its architect and champion, our current prime minister Theresa May, as “deport first, appeal later”, the hostile environment was aided and abetted by a hateful dog-whistle emanating from our tabloid press, reinforced by government ministers and politicians too craven to speak the truth about immigration, too weak and cowed to stand up for the rights of minorities.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.Toxic, anti-immigrant rhetoric created the demand for the hostile environment and then served to reinforce policies that addressed largely non-existent problems, pandered to the basest of prejudices and cowardly blamed immigrants for the failures of successive governments. As I previously said in the House of Commons, when you lay down with dogs you get fleas, and this government is in need of fumigation.\u0026nbspThere has been a desperate attempt on the right to separate race from immigration. But they are inseparable. The same prime minister who established a race disparity audit to reveal “difficult truths” also gave us the hostile environment. It is no coincidence that ministers and Whitehall mandarins in a government that failed to recruit a single black Caribbean person on to the civil service fast-stream programme last year saw black British citizens with Caribbean heritage as low-hanging fruit and easy targets.When the 2014 immigration bill passed through the House of Commons for its second reading, I described it as a stain on all that we have achieved as a democracy, ignorant of our history as a nation and harking back to the period when my father arrived in this country as a Windrush citizen to be met by “No Irish, no blacks, no dogs” signs. It is a tragedy that so many British citizens have had to suffer at the hands of this government before they took notice.In an effort to change the subject, cabinet ministers have been touring the studios trying to conflate the treatment of British citizens at the hands of their government with the issue of illegal immigration. Not only is this completely wrong and demonstrative of a worrying lack of understanding of the law, it is frankly insulting to those citizens who have been treated like criminals in their own country.This is symptomatic of how the hostile environment operates. It blurs the lines, and raises questions about the status of Commonwealth British citizens, refugees and asylum seekers so that anybody who looks as though they could conceivably be an illegal immigrant is seen as such.Let’s not let government ministers change the subject to illegal immigration. At root the hostile environment is a policy rooted in pernicious cruelty designed to make life so difficult for people who are here legally that they simply give up and, as suggested by Theresa May’s vans, “go home”.I see the human impact of the policy every week in my constituency surgery. Tottenham has long been proud of its history as an open, erse and multi-ethnic community so it was inevitable the hostile environment would flex its muscles there. Asylum seekers are banned from working, denied access to legal aid and unable to claim benefits so they seek legal support from a migrant support centre and sustenance from a soup kitchen run by a local church – both of which are in turn raided by Home Office enforcement.A minister falling on their sword is usually an attempt to draw a line under a scandal and encourage the media to move on. But the person sat in the hot seat at the Home Office makes no difference to the thousands of people suffering as a result of the hostile environment policy. An unjust law is no law at all.

The following day, Soviet tanks appeared on the streets of Prague. For seven days, the 30-year-old Moravian-born photographer roamed the city with his East German Exakta Varex camera loaded with movie film, the only stock he could find at short notice.The resulting images, some of which were smuggled out of the country, but many of which were not seen until decades later, captured the tumult of a traumatised city. They are recognised as one of the most powerful photojournalistic essays of the 20th century.Koudelka photographed teenagers blocking the paths of Soviet tanks, old people imploring the young Soviet soldiers to return home, flag-waving youths clambering over army vehicles. He returned to his apartment only to find more film or succumb to exhaustion. His images of defiance have, in the interim, become infused with a romantic, even elegiac quality. Their atmosphere is echoed in photographs of more recent upheavals, most notably the Arab Spring protests.This image, which he titled Hand and Wristwatch, is of a different order: a singular moment of calm and stillness. Here, there is no movement, no noise, only the almost empty street and that anonymous arm in the foreground, stretching out into the frame. It captures not just the moment the troops entered Prague but also the eerie atmosphere of an entire city and country helplessly losing its sense of itself.Look closely and you can see a small group of people who have left their work to gather on the pavement. In the background, those blurry vehicles may be tanks. Everything is uncertain here except the hand of a passerby, curled into a fist, and the hands of the watch that signal the moment when everything changed utterly for the citizens of the invaded city. This may be Koudelka’s only conceptual photograph, but it resonates as an iconic image of a tumultuous political moment in which there is no tumult – only an eerie silence in which time itself seems to have come to a halt. Sean O’Hagan The events of 1968 took some time to percolate through pop: it wasn’t until a year later that Thunderclap Newman would reach No 1 with a song urging the listener to “hand out the arms and ammo … because the revolution’s here”, and that a mood of increasing militancy would really start being reflected by black artists. Of the musicians who did react quickly to 1968’s tumult, the Rolling Stones were audibly re-energised and the Beatles baffled – “you can count me out … in,” sang John Lennon on Revolution. The most incendiary music made in immediate response to the year’s events, a recording of Nina Simone performing at the Westbury Music Fair three days after Martin Luther King’s assassination, was bowdlerised before being released, not least to remove the sound of Simone urging the audience to avenge King’s death by any means: “I ain’t about to be non-violent, honey.”Meanwhile, released in September 1968 – in the aftermath of the Miami riots and the Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago – Jefferson Airplane’s The House at Pooneil Corners offers the sound of hippy idealism curdling into something infinitely darker. It opens with scraping guitar noise, before an ominous, lumbering two-chord riff strikes up. The lyrics bemoan both “all the bullshit around us” and the counterculture’s desire to “get balled and high”: “You say it’s healing, but nobody’s feeling it … you say you don’t see and you don’t”. After two minutes, in lieu of the usual guitar solo, there’s a lengthy electronic wail that sounds like a siren, and the tone is increasingly apocalyptic: “There will be no survivors, my friend”.By the song’s conclusion, the lyrics are positing that a post-human world where “all the idiots have left” will be a kind of naive pastoral utopia replete with cows and turtle doves, but the music tells a different story: it just grinds relentlessly on and on, with more siren-like feedback, more keening guitars. It’s effective because it feels like an honest reaction to the events of 1968: not a strident call for revolution, nor a glib attempt to assure listeners that it’s going to be all right, but the sound of people clearly shaken and confused: peering, terrified, into the void. Alexis PetridisOn 22 November 1968, Star Trek boldly went where no primetime programme had gone before when it aired the first scripted interracial kiss on American TV, in an episode entitled Plato’s Stepchildren. It was not, it should be said, the most romantic of embraces Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Lieutenant Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) are forced into it by evil aliens with telekinetic powers. Thanks to some artful camera angles you don’t actually see their lips touch and the moment is very brief.But while the kiss may only have lasted a second, it represented decades of progress in regard to race relations in the States. It aired towards the end of the civil rights movement, after several hard-won legal milestones made African Americans slightly more equal under the law. In 1954, segregation was made illegal in public schools. In 1965 the Voting Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination in voting. In 1967, Loving v Virginia made anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional and rendered interracial marriage legal across the US. In April 1968, days after Martin Luther King was assassinated, the Fair Housing Act was passed, preventing housing discrimination based on race, sex, national origin and religion.It would be nice to say that Kirk and Uhura’s kiss represented a turning point in the US. That the revolution had, indeed, been televised and centuries of racial injustice were over, sealed with a kiss. However, 50 years later, depressingly little has changed. US public schools are more segregated now than they were during the civil rights movement, according to a 2013 report. And, that same year, a Cheerios ad featuring an interracial family generated so much racist abuse it made headlines.“Where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference,” Kirk told one of the evil aliens in Plato’s Stepchildren. That’s certainly not true now. Let’s hope things change sometime before the 2360s. Arwa MahdawiLandmark shows don’t have to be masterpieces. Alfred Jarry’s Ubu Roi is a piece of anarchic juvenilia but its Paris premiere in 1896 is accepted as the starting point of the theatre of the absurd. Similarly there may be better musicals than Hair but its opening at Shaftesbury theatre in London on 27 September 1968 (having been seen earlier that year on Broadway) was a political event for two closely connected reasons. The show not only built a popular musical out of protest. It was also the first production to capitalise on the abolition of theatrical censorship which had constricted the British stage since 1737.In those far-off days, all works had to be licensed for performance by the Lord Chamberlain, one of whose readers, in proposing a ban, reported of Hair: “It extols dirt, anti-Establishment views, homosexuality, free love, drug-taking and it inveighs against patriotism.” Actually, that’s a pretty accurate description of a show in which Claude, the son of uptight American parents, rejects the world of work and military induction to join a hippie tribe. Ultimately unable to dodge the draft, he ends up uniformed, hair-shorn and dead. The critic and director Charles Marowitz got it right when he wrote of Hair: “It is the most powerful piece of anti-war propaganda yet to come out of America. Without Vietnam and the American repugnance to that war, the show would never have come into being.”In Britain, there was a good deal of prurient interest in the show’s brief flash of nudity. But that was much less important than its rejection of the death-dealing values of the military-industrial complex and its celebration of life. Hair may have been prompted by anti-war feeling but the book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado and the music by Galt MacDermot are joyous rather than jaded. The opening and closing choruses of Aquarius and Let the Sunshine In ring with jubilation. The best moment comes when Hamlet’s “what a piece of work is a man” is turned into an affirmative song for three voices.From today’s perspective, the show’s faith in flower power and chemical experiments may seem naive but no piece of theatre better captures the political mood of the late 60s than this “tribal, love-rock musical”. Michael Billington In 1970 the American choreographer Yvonne Rainer staged an elegant anti-war version of her signature work, Trio A, during which her dancers performed naked with just the United States flag draped ironically around their necks. Rainer’s protest against US involvement in Vietnam would be followed, over the next decade, by a spate of politically conscious dance-making on both sides of the Atlantic. But at the start of 1968, militant acts of choreography tended to focus on the artform itself, re-evaluating the language and conventions of dance.Many of those militants were former students of Merce Cunningham, who was dedicated to the possibilities of pure movement. Cunningham was, in theory, the least political of choreographers. Yet he was always intensely alive to the world outside his studio, and RainForest, created in the spring of 1968, remains a prime example of how dance can become so porous to the zeitgeist that it becomes expressive, even prophetic of history.Much about the work is evocative of its title. David Tudor’s semi-improvised score is a dark forest of buzzing, squawking sound there’s a feral strangeness to many of the dancers’ movements as they crouch, stretch and stalk the stage and overhead the silver balloons of Andy Warhol’s set design cluster like a canopy of light reflecting leaves. It’s those balloons that take RainForest out of its exotic habitat into the unruly party spirit of the late 60s. Some of them are free-floating, so they bob around the stage whenever the performers happen to nudge or brush against them some even fly into the audience. In RainForest there’s a spirit of transformative anarchy at work that not only liberates its dancers from the ordinary rules of human engagement but from the normal constraints of performance. No showing of the work can ever be the same: the sheer chanciness of its construction makes it an embodiment of perpetual possibility and change. Judith Mackrell If any one movie is saturated with the political spirit of 1968, it has to be Jean-Luc Godard’s bizarre, wayward, instructive documentary about the Rolling Stones, entitled One Plus One and later recut and released in a more commercial version (which Godard angrily disowned) named Sympathy for the Devil, in honour of the famous track from the album Beggars Banquet that the Stones are shown recording. When the London film festival attempted to show this version, Godard denounced it from the stage and stalked out, punching the producer on the way.The film is a time capsule. Break it open and an overpowering and unwholesome fume of radical chic and 1968-ness rises from it: fascinating, infuriating. Godard himself became the charismatic face of radicalism that year in March 1968 he led – along with François Truffaut – the anti-Gaullist demonstrations in Paris against the sacking of the Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois which ended in scuffles with the police, Godard’s glasses being smashed, and a combustible situation that materially led to the greater disturbances of May.That summer, he went to London and made his One Plus One: long, unedited real-time sequences of the Stones rehearsing and recording in the studio. No rows or disruptions, though at one stage poor old Charlie Watts gets it in the neck from Mick for his drumming sounding “a bit dead”. But these shots are interspersed and juxtaposed with other sequences: a group of Black Panthers hang out in a junkyard, reading revolutionary texts, passing around weapons and stagily humiliating various submissive women. (The casual misogyny of the era is on display).Godard’s wife Anne Wiazemsky, named “Eve Democracy”, is shown drifting through woodland, laconically answering yes or no to questions from a camera crew. (“Do you think the lower classes have more sexual vitality than the upper classes?” Answer: yes.) A lone figure is shown spraying graffiti in her room at the Park Lane Hilton and then around the streets of London, shown in all their social-realist bleakness: slogans like CINEMARXISM and SOVIETCONG. A weird voice reads from political, pulp and pornographic novels. In a comic book store people give each other Nazi salutes.And what of the Stones? Before the last scene, Godard flashes up the famous graffiti slogan: “Beneath the stones, the beach” punningly hinting that the Stones have the real spirit of 68. But his invocation of the Black Panthers is also a coded denunciation of their appropriating black music. The poses that Godard strikes in this film, and the longueurs between them, are exasperating, though like so many Godard films, this one now shows – I believe – his affinity with conceptual art, as much as cinema. It also shows the strange, tense moodiness of the times: the simmering sense of disorder: jittery, euphoric, but with an edge of bleary cynicism, like the voice of Jagger’s Lucifer.

On the internet, Mean Girls battles only with Friends and The Simpsons to be the most referenced cultural product of all time. Yet those shows had hundreds of episodes Mean Girls squeezes so many perfect gags into its 97-minute running time that whenever a character speaks, it’s basically a catchphrase. “She doesn’t even go here” “Stop trying to make Fetch happen” “You smell like a baby prostitute” … I could go on.It is not merely Fey’s brilliant screenwriting that sets this film apart as a high-school classic. Unlike The Breakfast Club, Heathers, Thirteen or Clueless, it’s not enamoured with the internal politics of high school. At the beginning of the film, Cady – who was previously home-schooled in Africa – is presented with the cafeteria’s strict social hierarchy: varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don’t eat anything, and the Plastics – the coolest girls in school.It plays into that feeling everyone has at school: that they either are cool, or that they wish they could be. But soon after you leave school, you realise that everyone sucked: their clothes, their affectations, their terrible taste in music, the belief that you and your friends are the first people to do everything you’re doing. It doesn’t make any difference whether you were popular or not schoolkids are probably the lamest demographic ever.Mean Girls quietly goes about exposing this. The Plastics wear cheap makeup and pink track pants, yet tell everyone else what’s fashionable. The teachers, unable to control the student population, are revealed to have messy and miserable personal lives. Kevin G tries to offset his nerdy mathlete vibe by performing a gangsta rap at the school concert. Even the outsiders, Janis Ian and Damian, who consider themselves gatekeepers of the system, become obsessed with trying to overthrow it. The journey Cady goes on is not a transformation she doesn’t end up cooler than she was. Rather, it’s a realisation that everyone sucks the same. When the Plastics’ bitchy Burn Book is revealed to the school (“Amber D’Alessio: made out with a hotdog” “Kaitlyn Caussin is a fat whore who no one likes”), it shows that nobody is safe from the rampant bitching of insecure people trapped in a hell of their own making.Agree or disagree with our picks in this series?

In 2018, however, this familiar film format might be getting old Youth is wasted on the young, but then youth is wasted a lot of the time, especially when it comes to college movies. We oldies just don’t like to admit we’re jealous. If only we had a second chance: we’d do college so much better. We would party harder, we’d be more adventurous, we’d join the campus a cappella group. And study harder, too, now we’ve learned to cherish the gift of education. But this is the real world, so instead we live out the fantasy in films. This week’s mature student trying to roll back her maturity is Melissa McCarthy. In Life of the Party, her orced, fortysomething mum decides to go and get the college degree she has always wanted – at the same university as her daughter. As the title suggests, this is not a remake of Educating Rita. “I want the full experience,” says McCarthy, and that means getting a youthful makeover and sampling the breadth of extracurricular life, from tripping out on weed-laced chocolate to sneaking into the frat house. Plus the occasional bit of studying.That’s generally the way things pan out in back-to-college movies. They go in thinking it’s going to be like National Lampoon’s Animal House, and it is – only with a moral lesson thrown in at the end. Every generation has had this fantasy. In the 1960s, it was Bing Crosby playing a 51-year-old getting down with the kids in High Time. “I want the full treatment, the works,” he tells the enrolment officer. Sound familiar? After 1986’s Back to School came the original series of 21 Jump Street, in which Johnny Depp and other fresh-faced cops masqueraded as high-school students. In the 90s, Drew Barrymore did the same in Never Been Kissed, playing a frumpy but youthful-looking undercover reporter returning to slay the demons of her unhappy teenhood (in retrospect, her pupil-teacher romance raises a few ethical issues).What is really out of date with these movies, however, are their fantasies of campus life. Today’s students are likely to have more on their minds than the venue of their next keg party. They’re juggling their studies with part-time jobs to repay their student loans. They’re protesting over the marketisation of academia, issues of inclusivity, and Milo Yiannopoulos. Campus intimacy is more a matter of negotiated consent protocols than wild abandon. And rather than their parents coming to their college, their worst nightmare is having to move back in with them after they graduate. As for adults entering higher education, they should be applauded and not stigmatised. But who wants to watch a movie about mature students acting maturely?All of which suggests that there has never been a better time for a generation-gap college comedy, and who better than Melissa McCarthy to lead one? If it’s done well enough, we might even learn something.Life of the Party is in UK cinemas on 11 May "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a40c24c66eecbd91a6ae9851623748419db1709/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d332dfd061ad62a69accb65ad91bb34","title":"tottenham reality check stadium costs escalate mauricio pochettino","story":"Mauricio Pochettino will still have to sell players in order to buy them next season despite an increased ground capacityMauricio Pochettino has expressed the belief on several occasions. When Tottenham Hotspur move into their 62,062-seat stadium next season, the club will enter a new era of financial power. “It would be the time to say: ‘Now, we will win the title,’” the manager said in December. The theory has been that the stadium’s increased revenues will help the club to attract and keep the A-list players.The view has sat uncomfortably with the cost of construction. It seems a long time ago that £400m was the ballpark figure. Then, it became £750m and £850m, and now, nobody would be surprised if it reached a billion. Tottenham have taken out £400m in bank loans, which are repayable over a five-year period. This month they announced in their financial results for the year ended 30 June 2017 that the “cumulative spend” on the project had increased from £115.3m to £315.1m. The club’s profits were robust. They stood at £41.2m after interest and tax. But whichever way you dress it up, there is a lot of money to find. It is no wonder chairman Daniel Levy “struggles to sleep at night”, according to Pochettino.The penny – or great mountains of them – appears to have dropped with Pochettino and when he addressed the press, before Monday’s game against Watford at Wembley, there was a shift in his stance.“The move to the new stadium is not suddenly going to change everything and millions of pounds will rain from the sky,” Pochettino said. “You have to manage and know exactly the expectations. It will be important to review and set the principles again how it will be with the team once we move.”Pochettino’s comments felt significant, just like the ones he made after the FA Cup semi defeat against Manchester United. In four post-match interviews he used the same phrase. The club needed more time to achieve success, he said, and it would be “with me or another” manager.Pochettino was asked for clarification and explained Tottenham’s project was fixed so strongly for the long term it was inevitable another manager would one day take over the responsibility. His contract runs for a further three years. The project is designed for many more.It remains difficult to escape the impression that Pochettino is approaching a crossroads. He has urged Levy on more than one occasion to move quickly in this summer’s transfer market while he ignored a question about whether he would lead the club into the new stadium and, instead, answered one of his own – the classic politician’s trick. “If I stay here for three more years, the project will not change,” Pochettino said. “We cannot change because the club cannot change. Whether it is me or another, that is the right project to keep pushing.The supporters’ fear is that Pochettino will be prised away. The good news for them is that PSG are likely to replace Unai Emery with Thomas Tuchel while Real Madrid will surely not dispense with Zinedine Zidane if, as expected, he takes them to a third successive Champions League final.But Pochettino has seen the future at Tottenham with clarity. The new stadium will change little for him. His transfer dealings since his arrival in the summer of 2014 have shown a net spend on permanent fees of £40.25m – a remarkably low figure – and he will continue to have to sell in order to buy to keep the books balanced.Meanwhile the Manchester clubs, in particular, will carry on splurging. At what point does that get to Pochettino – a manager whose stated ambition is to win the Premier League title?Tottenham remain in a curiously hemmed-in position with regard to strengthening the squad. Last summer they sold Kyle Walker to Manchester City for an initial £50m to fund purchases that would make the collective stronger and this time they are expected to do something similar. Toby Alderweireld is for sale while they would listen to offers for Danny Rose and, surprisingly, Mousa Dembélé.However, the incoming signings would have to fit into Levy’s wage structure, which is capped at a basic £100,000 a week, although not for him. He earned £6m, including bonuses, equating to £115,000 a week, in the year covered by the most recent accounts.It will be difficult to find too many players who would improve Pochettino’s best XI and be happy to sign for, say, £60,000 to £70,000 a week, which is the threshold for many of his starters.One example is Wilfried Zaha, who earns more than £120,000 a week at Crystal Palace. A deal for the winger would be complicated on many levels, not least in terms of the impact it would have on existing squad harmony, which Pochettino has fostered expertly.Will Levy raise the wage ceiling? Yes, although not to market rates. In other words, the club’s stars could get more elsewhere, if they could get out – which is a big if under Levy.Are Tottenham stronger without Walker or, indeed, Alderweireld, who has been marginalised? One thing can be said for certain and it is that the club’s players have noted with interest how Walker has trebled his salary at City and won the title. Could they do one or both at Tottenham? For Pochettino, the balancing act does not get any easier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350b7ecf44405b86d737024f955312d9f0c176c1/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=964426d6049ae9645ffb254c778b9649","title":"fa wembley sale 600m price football grassroots","story":"Price is not right but more relevant than the lack of control over the stadium’s future is can we really trust football’s governing body to oversee the reinvestment into the grassroots game?No wonder Ken Bates was apoplectic. “You never sell your freehold – it’s your home,” the former Chelsea chairman exclaimed on being told of the deal to sell Wembley. To find oneself on the same side as Bates is a remarkable side-effect of the FA’s sudden announcement. And on that of Sir Dave Richards, the former chairman of the Premier League and, like Bates, once a prominent member of the FA board. But their point is a powerful one, as those millennials waiting for their parents to die in order to be able to own a house will confirm.Khan arrived in the USA 50 years ago with only pennies in his pocket, built an auto-parts business and is said to be worth more than $8bn. As a commercially astute man, he must think the FA are a bunch of mugs. Either that, or he must be wondering if there’s a catch. But, this being English football’s governing body, a cunning plan would be too much for them to devise, unless it came from Baldrick’s playbook.If they let the freehold of the stadium go to the owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Fulham FC for the reported £600m, the ultimate size of the cheque deposited in the FA’s bank account is likely to be significantly smaller. It should be reduced, in the first instance, by the total of £112.7m of public money provided in order to subsidise the final work of replacing the old Twin Towers with Norman Foster’s tilted arch.When Sport England gave £78m, the department for culture, media and sport contributed £18.5m and the London Development Agency coughed up £16.2m, the donations were for a specific purpose. They were not made for the benefit of grassroots football. The money was given in order to complete the creation of a stadium that would be the showplace of the English game, built in a location of great historical importance and emotional significance.This was to be the shining city on a hill, a football cathedral, visible from all points of the compass, a place of inspiration, aspiration and pilgrimage. And, for the first time, it would belong to English football, once Messrs Bates, Richards and their various committees had negotiated their way to ensuring that the old building, and the freehold of the land on which it stood, had been purchased for £106m from Wembley PLC, the heirs to the owners of the original Empire Stadium.That plan has now been abandoned, at a point where the debt of more than £400m incurred during the course of construction had been brought down to £140m – or a little more than half the total sum Ellis Short has just written off in order to persuade a bunch of investors to take Sunderland off his hands. That debt will still have to be repaid over a planned six-year term, but the £112.7m of public money should be reimbursed without delay.No doubt the FA will hope to avoid that obligation by pointing to its ambition to use its supposed windfall to benefit grassroots football by providing thousands of all-weather pitches around the country. The desire to repair the damage done by cuts to public amenities during the long years of Tory-driven austerity is an admirable one but the fear must be that, given its erratic record over the decades, the FA will not use the money with the necessary discipline. And once you start taking large chunks out of £600m, it can disappear pretty quickly.The key issue, however, is this: do we need the Wembley we have known since Giampaolo Pazzini of Italy Under-21s became the first player to score a goal at the new stadium 11 years ago? Is it worth having a home which acts as a symbol of the country where the game was invented, where the statue of Bobby Moore provides a permanent record of a shining hour, and whose facade can be used to note the passing of a Cyrille Regis, a Jimmy Armfield or a Ray Wilkins, as it has done with dignity this year?Supporters of the plan will say that it makes no difference whether the FA owns the place or simply rents it when required, while continuing take the income from broadcasting rights, sponsorship deals and Club Wembley. But owning and renting carry very different emotional weights. And although, after a rocky start, Khan is proving himself to be a good steward of Craven Cottage, his priority as the owner of Wembley would undoubtedly be to establish it as the home of his NFL team, the Jaguars, providing the league with its long desired permanent bridgehead into Europe. And no doubt the sale of naming rights would be an early consequence. Most NFL teams, after all, play in places bearing names such as MetLife, Heinz, AT\u0026ampT and FedEx.It is absolutely right to want to improve facilities for amateurs and young players around the country. But with the amount of money sloshing into and sluicing out of the game each year, there must be cleverer ways of paying for it than by selling your birthright for a mess of pottage.

Along with Fortnite, Evoland 2, Trick Shot 2 and more new mobile games to tryThe first Evoland was essentially a megamix of the best bits from the history of role-playing games, from monochrome Game Boy questing to Final Fantasy-style battles. The sequel continues in that vein, packing in knowing references for long-time game and anime fans without bamboozling everyone else. From pixel-art platforming to 3D open-world exploring, Evoland 2 sends you through a montage of fun moments, both familiar and novel.A playground craze the likes of which we’ve not seen since Minecraft, Fortnite is a colourful, rather creative battle-royale shooter: 100 players begin a match, one remains at the end. Where Fortnite prevails over its rival PUBG, which also appeared on phones this month, is that it feels natural on a touchscreen, from the smart placement of the on-screen buttons to double-tap gestures that make aiming while running painless. You might download it for your kids, but you’ll want to play it yourself.Oddmar sounds like a standard action game about a Viking hero searching for his lost village while ridding the local forest of critters. What sets it apart is the sheer craft that’s gone into it, from its super-smooth animation as Oddmar leaps through the 24 beautiful (and visually varied) levels to its finely honed touch controls – often an Achilles heel for this genre on mobile. You can breeze through in a matter of hours, but the challenges on each level – from collecting coins to finishing as quickly as possible – give you more for your money.Building on the crafting’n’survival principles that Minecraft popularised and countless other games have refined and experimented with, The Bonfire: Forsaken Lands has you building a settlement in a snowy wasteland by day, then protecting it from monster attacks by night. This day-night cycle gives the game an enthralling rhythm, as you unlock new buildings to craft and uncover more of its story (which, although it falls into the “mysterious ancient civilisations” trope, isn’t too stale).Mobile gamers have been playing neighbourhood-god in The Sims: FreePlay, a cut-down version of the life-simulator Sims games on PC tuned for smartphone habits, since late 2011. It’s now been superseded by The Sims Mobile, which is much closer to the bigger, better PC games. It suits the rhythm of mobile play (short bursts rather than long sessions), letting you micromanage your Sim people and see their work, love lives and home decor evolve. There are energy meters and a timer that locks you out of the game, both designed to nudge you towards in-app purchases, but it nonetheless retains the magnetism of the PC games as your community develops.2015’s Trick Shot was a slow-burning hit: a set of minimalist physics puzzles created by one of the designers of Monument Valley. This sequel keeps the stripped-down “get the ball in the box” idea, with a think-test-repeat dynamic to making best use of the buttons, teleporters, levers and other items. The inclusion of a level editor is heartening too. The majority of players may not have the patience to create their own puzzles, but the ones that do can share them with the community – which should ensure a steady supply of new trick shots to master.“A dark world plagued by beasts and demons” is a setup we’ve seen before, but never quite in this context. Keep in Mind’s hero is Jonas, whose own darkness encompasses alcoholism and depression. His night-time “mirror” world is the key to confronting his issues. The developer created the game for playersfacing their own mental-health issues, and it deserves a wide audience. The exploration and monster interactions are relatively simple, but the message stays with you long after you’ve completed it.One of the first big App Store hits in 2008 was a novelty app to pour a virtual pint. 10 years later, we have games about brewing craft beer. This sits in an accessible spot between full business simulation and mobile-friendly “clicker” game, with a smooth path from your first brew to a thriving business. It’s impossible not to be enjoyably sidetracked by the game’s label-designer section, welding decals, shapes and lettering together for your own ugly-beautiful beer labels.Alto’s Adventure, from 2015, was a beautiful-looking, endless snowboarding game, but developer Snowman has swapped snow for sand for the sequel, with a desert theme providing plenty more scenery to gawp at. You’ll be swooping down slopes, flipping somersaults while airborne, and avoiding obstacles from rock-piles to chasms, taking in sunsets and storms. It’s calming and meditative, with a zen mode that strips out the scoring aspect for an even more relaxed experience.If you ’re familiar with Final Fantasy XV, it’s unlikely you’ll want to play it on a phone, but this edition is an excellent introduction for everyone else. It is a unique and endearing mix of road trip and Japanese fantasy, starring a boyband-esque group of friends who spend as much time tooling around in an open-topped sports car as they do battling monsters. It’s simplified well for touchscreens: the characters fight for themselves, with you influencing the action through well-timed taps to dodge, block and use special attacks. Final Fantasy is an acquired taste, but try the first episode for free to see if you like it. The next two cost 99p each, and the final seven cost £3.99 apiece.The fourth in a series of super-tactile puzzle-box games, Old Sins bucks the law of diminishing returns: it’s the best yet. Exploring a ghostly doll’s house, you solve a physical puzzles by manipulating the objects you find there, sliding open secret compartments, rotating statues and ringing bells. Experimental tapping will only get you so far: real progress (and intense satisfaction) comes once you tune in to The Room’s twisty logic.Kitty Powers is the drag alter ego of games developer Richard Franke and the star of 2014’s Kitty Powers’ Matchmaker, which saw her (and you) matching cartoon clients for a dating agency. This sequel is about those successfully matched couples, who are now falling in love – and you are a God-like figure in charge of their town. Getting up and running takes a while, but you’ll soon be learning your villagers’ likes and dislikes and enthusiastically barging in on their romantic lives. It’s a nice twist on Sims-style, life-management genre.This turn-based strategy game sits somewhere between Hearthstone and Clash Royale, because you battle with fantasy character cards. There’s a well-designed solo mode to teach you how to fight and build a decent deck, ready for taking on other players online. There’s a lot of scope to sculpt a deck for your preferred battling style, using archer- and spell-heavy ranged attack tactics to up-close brawny brutes, but the intricacies don’t feel overwhelming.More fantasy deck building here, but Meteorfall is focused on solo play, with elements of dungeon adventuring woven in to its card battling. You choose a character, get a basic deck of attack cards, then swipe your way through fights with monsters, stopping off to expand and upgrade your deck and level-up your hero. Deaths are unavoidable, but you can save the gems earned by playing to unlock some new cards for the next time round. It’s a tight, cleverly focused card battler which will likely have you missing your train or bus stop, such is its one-more-go factor.“You control the level, not the character” isn’t an original twist, but in the right hands it can be inventive, as developer Alike Studio proves here. Your job is to guide alien hero Polo through a host of platform levels to find his kidnapped pet. Swipe vertical sections of the level up or down to swap in different obstacles and items before sending Polo through to see how he fares. It’s a cross between a game and a children’s mix-and-match book: pretty tough, but rarely frustrating. Already popular on consoles, Death Squared has you sliding two miniature robots through more than 80 levels, manipulating mechanisms and avoiding triggering traps to ensure both reach their end markers. You can play alone but Death Squared’s main appeal is as a co-op game for two players, each controlling a robot with gestures on one half of the screen. It’s less fiddly on an iPad, and one of the better family games of 2018, even though it wasn’t especially designed for children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c620bfadb8b4d4ac7b4ef350d74ea0b79ba81cac/0_673_5278_3167/master/5278.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ecb77d0e85a614308a4ef78d2fee927","title":"un suspends key witness miriam maluwa unaids","story":"Miriam Maluwa put on administrative leave after giving evidence to support claims against UNAids deputy directorA key witness in a sexual assault investigation involving a UN assistant secretary general has been suspended from her job, in a move campaigners say is a show of “pure intimidation tactics”.Miriam Maluwa, who has worked for the UN for more than 25 years, was placed on administrative leave from her post as country director for UNAids in Ethiopia on 27 March. In a letter from the agency she was told this action did not amount to disciplinary measures, but that UNAids would be conducting a management and operational review of the country’s office during her absence. The agency added that Maluwa, one of the most senior women within UNAids, was not allowed to enter the office or access the agency’s servers or documents without supervision. The following week, an email was sent to key partners, embassies and government ministries announcing that an interim country director had been appointed to her position.Maluwa was also copied into emails stating that her contract had been terminated, though she said the agency later told her these were sent in error. The campaign group Code Blue, which is supporting Maluwa, said the agency had not explained the reasons for its actions and was not following the correct processes. “The standard procedure if there’s going to be an administrative and management review is that you tell the staff member why, tell them what the claims are against them, and you give them the opportunity to respond to those claims,” said Paula Donovan, co-director of Code Blue. Last year, Maluwa was a key witness in an investigation into sexual assault and harassment allegations involving the UNAids deputy director, Luiz Loures, who was alleged to have assaulted a colleague in a hotel lift. Maluwa, who spoke to the complainant after the alleged assault took place, told investigators that the alleged victim was distressed and asked to borrow a phone – evidence that supported the woman’s claims. Loures, who denies the allegations, was not suspended during the investigation.Donovan said Maluwa was being targeted following her role as a witness, and her refusal to contribute towards internal efforts to defend the agency’s director, Michel Sidibé, who has faced widespread criticism over attempts to interfere with the inquiry.The investigation found the claims against Loures to be unsubstantiated, but its results have since been suspended. On Friday, it was announced the case would be reopened in light of additional allegations that had surfaced, and would be conducted by the UN’s investigations team, the office of internal oversight services. In February, the  reported concerns relating to how the investigation was handled, along with testimonies from a group of women alleging they had also been assaulted or harassed by Loures, or that they had warned the agency’s director, Michel Sidibé, about his deputy’s behaviour. The alleged victim in the Loures case, Martina Brostrom, claims Sidibé attempted to bribe her to drop her complaint by offering a promotion. Sidibé denies this, but admitted to WHO investigators that he had met Brostrom to suggest they “see how we can really find a way out without making it a big problem for all the organisation and for the credibility of the organisation, for yourself”.Brostrom said that she only heard the case was being reopened through the media. “A new internal investigation does not make any sense to me. Anything short of an investigation fully independent from the UN will not be enough,” she said.Sidibé faced further criticism after details of an all-staff meeting were leaked to the , during which he suggested women who have spoken out “don’t have ethics” and appeared to make veiled threats to whistleblowers. Several HIV activist groups have called for an independent investigation into the agency, with the Aids Healthcare Foundation calling for Sidibé’s resignation.In a letter sent to the UNAids staff this month, Sidibé appeared to backtrack from his earlier comments, writing: “I will do all in my power to ensure UNAids’s culture is one in which it is clear that no one should feel threatened – and in which no one is threatened … People who speak out and bring complaints forward help the organisation.”Code Blue said that, despite such promises, Sidibé had continued to retaliate against staff. It added that a new UN investigation would be marred by continued conflicts of interest. In a statement, the campaign group called for member states to establish a temporary independent oversight panel to monitor closely the UN’s response to inidual allegations of sexual offences, with the power to intervene immediately where actions could harm victims or witnesses. The panel would also make recommendations on UN policies and procedures. UNAids said in a statement that it could not comment on its actions relating to Maluwa. It said: “We cannot provide specific information about the review to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the process. However, we can confirm that it is not related to the recent case of sexual harassment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad098396d20783c168a7242de07d2175f8f7da70/58_1074_2899_1739/master/2899.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576e47d7496dfd6f32ffa641036a4cbc","title":"jamie oliver criticism affect me childhood obesity","story":"From school dinners to sugar, the chef’s campaigns provoke strong reactions – but he won’t give up. Why? ‘It just feels like the right thing to do’‘If you analyse what I’m saying,” says Jamie Oliver, “there’s nothing clever and there’s nothing really that controversial it’s fucking really basic common sense.”We meet on the morning that a letter he coordinated has been released, addressed to the prime minister and signed by Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders. It calls on the government to ban junk food advertising before 9pm and unhealthy buy-one-get-one-free offers, among other things. Oliver is proud of it. He looks relaxed, sitting on one of the sofas in his industrial, vintage-styled head office – although he knows the attacks will come. Later, he will be accused on Twitter of being the “fun police” a column in the Sun will call it a nanny-state initiative that penalises poor people.He talks in long, rambling sentences, bristling with energy. His transformation from cheeky-chappy Essex boy chef to single-issue crusader, facts and figures to hand, about to appear in front of a select committee, is complete. You would think he would have enough going on – he closed several of his restaurants recently and restructured his business – but Oliver remains laser-focused on the issue of childhood obesity.So far, Oliver seems to be coming at obesity principally as a diet problem, rather than a social one, although it may be too much to ask even someone as energetic and ambitious as him to fix society. Obesity disproportionately affects children in deprived areas. If there is one criticism of Oliver that seems to stand up, it is that he does not entirely understand what it is like to live in relentless, grinding poverty: to be unable to afford fresh vegetables (healthy food is three times more expensive, per calorie, than unhealthy food – Oliver has suggested that the government should subsidise healthy food) to be too tired to cook from scratch every night to take the financial risk on a lentil recipe that your kids may refuse to eat.At one point, when we are talking about whether people – working parents, people who have to work several jobs – can be persuaded to turn their backs on the ease of convenience food, he acknowledges that “humans crave convenience, that’s what we’re programmed to do. But convenience food doesn’t have to be shit. The freezer is the future.” But what if you live in a small flat, with a tiny fridge and just an ice box? “Of course, but you can buy it on the defrost – that will be two or three days in the fridge still. You don’t have to have it all racked up in the freezer. But costs are down, welfare is up, waste down. Convenience food doesn’t have to be shite.” But it probably will not be cheap.Maybe it does not help when he keeps talking about “them” and “us”, as if people on low incomes or benefits are a separate species. But he is not having it. “Yeah, because I don’t have to worry about feeding my kids today and they do. It’s not hard to get someone to say: ‘Jamie Oliver is a wanker.’ I think the concept of having an opinion and caring in Britain is a really funny one, you know: ‘How dare you.’” It is true that he is in an impossible position – as a chef reportedly worth £150m, he is regularly accused of hypocrisy (years on, those lucrative supermarket adverts are used as a stick with which to beat him) and for lecturing the rest of us, but the alternative would be to do nothing. “When I stand up there and start talking, you may or may not like what I say,” he says. “But if you’ve ever seen the people representing the advertising industry or the food industry, I know you would trust me with your kids more than them.”Why does he do it? There must be times when an easier life – with his wife, Jools, their five children and their lovely £9m home in Hampstead, north London, and his TV cookery shows – seem more appealing. “The important stuff I’ve done I’ve rarely enjoyed,” he says. “I get a beating quite regularly.” So, why carry on? “It just feels like the right thing to do,” he says slowly, enunciating every word.Oliver became political early on. It was only three years after his explosive 1999 debut as the Naked Chef that he was training unemployed young people to staff his restaurant Fifteen – filmed, of course, for a TV series (few can match Oliver’s media skills). His campaign to improve school dinners culminated in the series Jamie’s School Dinners in 2005, while his 2008 series Ministry of Food followed his initiative to teach cookery skills in Rotherham (that project closed last year after Rotherham council stopped funding it, but there are others around the country).In 2015, Oliver turned his attention to sugar with his documentary Jamie’s Sugar Rush. The month it aired, he says darkly, “stuff changed. Like burglaries, computer systems, break-ins at the office, home.” Before I can ask if he thinks Big Sugar was trying to intimidate him, he continues: “I don’t know, but there’s a string of events since the month that started.” Still, the sugar tax was introduced, under David Cameron’s government (Oliver has been scathing of Theresa May’s childhood obesity strategy).People have often tried to work out what drives Oliver, but I suspect it is as simple as the satisfaction of seeing results (just like the process of starting with raw ingredients and producing a Sunday roast). “As time has gone on and we’ve got some stuff done, you realise that getting stuff done isn’t that common,” he says. Someone called him a socialist recently and he had to look up the definition. He does not think he is one he prefers the idea of running a commercial business with a social ethos.That is not to say everyone agrees he is succeeding. A report in the Times last month portrayed his chief executive Paul Hunt, who is married to Oliver’s sister, as a bully, quoting a former employee who said “morale is at rock bottom”. “It’s complete bollocks,” Oliver says. “You can walk round the business. Like I said to the editor when they ran the story, come in and talk to everyone. If you’re talking about some bad leavers, of course you’re going to find some people who have something to whine about.”It has been a tough year for Oliver – tougher still for some of his staff. He describes the closure of one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants and 12 of the 37 UK branches of his chain Jamie’s Italian as “awful. Worst time in my life.” It is the job losses, he says. “We’ve still got 2,000 people, but we’ve had to close 12 restaurants, which is about 800 people.”It can be easy to forget that, amid all the campaigning and the chain-restaurant managing, Oliver is still a wildly popular and successful chef. His most recent book, 5 Ingredients, was one of his biggest-selling and he has another out in the summer. He still writes two recipes every day (about a third are healthy, the rest less so this is often pointed out as though it is evidence of Oliver’s hypocrisy).Anyway, he has to go – Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, that other anti-obesity campaigner and chef, is on the phone. Oliver says his business is committed to the target of halving childhood obesity by 2030. “That is what you’re going to hear me say for the next 12 years,” he says. You have to admire his single-mindedness. “Don’t get me wrong,” he adds, “I’m fucking looking forward to retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0f85cc3123b23ac4773b2fb9132ac9b8176b6/0_125_5220_3133/master/5220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b04a1a904aca319f387ac97d28381d6f","title":"how to make new friends adult lonely leap of faith","story":"Striking up friendships can be tricky – and studies show millions of us are lonely. Here, four people who forged new connections explain how they did it. Plus: psychologist Linda Blair gives her tipsWhen you are a child in the playground it is pretty simple, but “Do you want to be my friend?” isn’t a line you hear from adults. Teenage years are filled with friendships easily made (and some easily forgotten), when you are feeling keen, sociable and energetic. Then there are engagements, marriage, relocation, career changes, families: life comes calling with its multiple demands, and friendships evolve as a result. I have been happy to see my friends move through these huge life moments, but as much as I value my friendships, I have found myself lonely at times. Some friends are physically far away, while others are time-poor and, with the best will in the world, it isn’t simple to see each other as often as we would like.According to a recent study by the Red Cross in partnership with Co-op, more than nine million adults in the UK are often or always lonely. We are facing a loneliness epidemic, with Theresa May taking the step earlier this year of appointing Tracey Crouch as what some have dubbed the “minister for loneliness” to try to tackle the issue.Loneliness is something we all feel at times and to varying degrees, but it can also be something that we feel uneasy about admitting to.Still, making friends as an adult can be hard, and takes time – last week a study from the University of Kansas found that two people need to spend 90 hours together to become friends, or 200 hours to qualify as close friends.Clinical psychologist Linda Blair agrees that this can be difficult to achieve: “Usually the basis of making a friend is a shared experience.” These are often in abundance in our earlier years, but once those easy opportunities are gone, you can forget that the initial basis for a friendship is to have a similar passion or interest. Joining a group or class based on something you really love, or volunteering for something you care about, can be a great first step for finding friendships, she advises.Although it can be tricky and nerve-racking, making new friends as an adult can also be rewarding: a message Jacqueline Thomas, 52, is keen to share. Moving to the Warwickshire village of Bulkington in 2015 with her partner David, who is soon to retire, she relished the opportunity to start anew.“We’ve had to start from scratch because we didn’t know anybody here. Our kids have grown up, so we were looking at a slightly quieter life, but it’s actually turned out to be busier than before,” she says.Jacqueline started by introducing herself to her neighbours. She credits signing up to a variety of classes and groups at the village hall as the catalyst for her new friendships. She joined the WI hesitantly, worried it would be “all jam and Jerusalem, and I’d be the youngest person there”. But she now says it was one of the best decisions of her life.Don’t be afraid to try something new, she stresses. A lifelong wheelchair user, Jacqueline was intrigued by a poster in the village hall advertising an adapted martial arts class. Having gone along with some doubts, she was surprised to find how much she enjoyed it. Encouraged by her teacher, Carl Hodgetts, who in 2006 became the first wheelchair-using kickboxing instructor in the UK, she now proudly holds a white belt in Shiying Do adapted martial art. “It just takes one leap of faith. Even if you’re absolutely terrified, do it,” she says, adding: “Even I’m a bit shocked about the martial arts, though.”Over the past couple of years, and nearing 30, I made a conscious effort to make friends. Not to replace old ones, but to make new connections. Friendships, says Blair, are “like an onion. There’s all these layers of friends and the inner layer are your best friends – you probably only have two or three in your whole life.” You might not gain a new best friend, but finding friends for different interests in your life, at different stages, can be a positive.A personal success story came from a friend’s wedding last summer. Rebecca and I bonded over our rumbling bellies as we awaited the bride’s entrance. It turned out we lived near each other in London and had gone to the same school in Dorset (albeit in different years, which when you’re a child makes a crucial difference). We discussed travel, food and summer plans, but I wasn’t sure our newfound friendship would exist outside the tipsy haze of a wedding celebration. But I had resolved not to let these moments slip away and took her number. Fast forward to a meetup in a bar in central London. I had fretted about what to wear, whether she would recognise me and if there would be awkward silences but we are now firm friends, exploring the capital and taking it in turns to suggest somewhere new.Joining local running and cycling groups has also been a positive step. It is an excellent way to meet people in the area. Pete McLeod, 25, a fellow athletics fan and member of my track and field club, Hercules Wimbledon, agrees. After finishing his master’s at Loughborough University, he moved to Wimbledon for his first job and joined the club to keep fit. Making new friends has been a bonus: “It’s really rewarding. You get to practise something you enjoy but also have the opportunity to meet new people.”Pete made a New Year resolution in 2015 to push himself out of his comfort zone and speak to people more: “The club was a good opportunity to put that into practice … when people aren’t out of breath.” He counts some members of the sprinting group as very good friends now, with the japes and conversations flowing over into tennis matches or walks and coffee at the weekend.It is important to be proactive, says Juliana Nabinger, 42, who moved from Brazil to Chile with her husband and two young children three years ago. “Don’t sit and wait – it won’t happen. You have to actively search for new friends.” Now fluent in Spanish, she says that when she first moved she would use the few words she knew to ask questions while waiting for her children to finish at school, even when she knew the answers: “At first it was difficult because I really started to miss my friends and adult conversation, but the kids kept me busy and, through them, I made friends.”Now, via a Facebook group of English-speaking mums and her Spanish conversations at the school gates, she has a solid group of local and expat friends. “The best thing is, you’re older and you don’t judge people,” she says. The worst? “Sometimes people don’t understand your feelings or choices because they don’t know everything. They only have parts of a puzzle.”Friendships can also come from the most unexpected places. Moving from Eday, a small island in Orkney, with a community of about 140 people, to mainland Orkney, Stephen Walters, 43, and his family went from knowing almost everyone to not knowing anyone socially. His wife, Ronie, started the UK’s most northerly roller derby league, the Orkney ViQueens. Initially, Stephen joined to train as a referee and was the only man there, but he went on to became a coach despite having little previous experience on skates. Within a year he had an abundance of friends of all ages, he says.Roller derby’s ethos of inclusion and equality has been a big attraction for him: “I have bipolar disorder and there are a couple of others with similar issues. You can tell when somebody is not quite their usual self and people generally look out for each other, which is really nice.”Not having been involved much in a sport before, he admits he was concerned it would be difficult at his age, but now urges others to give it a try: “Go out and try some activities you’re interested in and talk to people. If it doesn’t work, try another one.”Embarking on friendships as an adult can be terrifying, exciting, rewarding and challenging. Nothing can replace the special connections you have with those who have known you over the years, but taking that leap of faith Jacqueline mentioned can reinvigorate and get the ball rolling. Before rushing off to her afternoon martial arts class, she imparts some simple but effective advice: when it comes to making friends, “Don’t be afraid of being scared. Do it anyway.”Build your self-confidenceLiking yourself before going off in search of friends is an important step to building healthy relationships. “Think about what you like about yourself. When you’re comfortable with yourself, it shines out of you.”Find something you feel passionate about Join a language class if you love languages or volunteer outdoors if you love nature. “That’s where you’ll find friendships.”Put yourself out there Remember, nothing ventured, nothing gained. “It isn’t that you lose if you meet someone and it doesn’t fit for a friendship. That’s not losing, that’s having tried.” Meet in a neutral place Once you have taken the first step and are moving on to meeting outside the initial environment where you made a connection, chose a neutral public space. This can lessen the pressures that, say, hosting at home can bring, and give you time to focus on each other. “If you want to be popular, ask people about themselves and listen sincerely when they answer. A good listener is rare these days. It is the best passport you could possibly have to friendship.”A common mistake is expecting too much from one person. It is more realistic and healthier to have a variety of friends for different reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/111c7e9dcb8963a7f2162f87836ab83ae6d4dfed/0_0_1301_781/master/1301.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8ad205fc4cad6fce5808ce21d477052","title":"our hero first female workhouse guvnor is star of exhibition","story":"Lady Ridding fought for rights of inmates after winning election in which women had no votesIn 1894, a respectable and apparently meek woman did something many contemporaries would have regarded as astonishing, if not deplorable. She stood for election to the district council against two male candidates, including a vicar. When Lady Laura Ridding, wife of a bishop, won an election in which women had no vote, she became the first female  of the local workhouse, Southwell in Nottinghamshire.“She was a remarkable woman, our Laura, and having got herself elected she really was a force for change,” said Jan Overfield Shaw, a community officer at the Victorian workhouse. “She did what none of the male s did: she saw what could really make a difference to the lives of the women here – including better food and proper underwear.“The bishop was much older than her, and he looks a bit dry in official portraits – but he supported her work for women’s rights.”Southwell is one of the best-preserved workhouses in the country and is now owned by the National Trust. Ridding’s photograph, which shows her gazing up at her fiance, has just gone on display among portraits of the suffragists and suffragettes she joined in the campaign for votes for women. The exhibition, created by the National Trust and the National Portrait Gallery, is in the former committee room of the workhouse, where between 1894 and 1905 Ridding worked with the other s.Ridding, an author whose works include three volumes of her husband’s biography, was already a founder member of the National Union of Women Workers, an umbrella organisation for voluntary philanthropy. The exhibition reflects isions at the time. Octavia Hill, the co-founder of the National Trust, wrote to the Times in 1910 saying “a serious loss to our country would arise if women entered political life”.She shares the walls with the Pankhursts Mary Raleigh Richardson, who slashed Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus in the National Gallery to publicise the campaign and the actor Ellen Terry, who supported votes for women but wrote: “The Suffragettes are a magnificent lot of women but I think perhaps their ardour carries them away at times.”Ridding, though never a window-smashing militant, would ardently support the campaign after her own small victory in the local election. Newly transcribed diaries show her worrying about small details that could make the everyday life of the inmates wretched or relatively content: the meat she tasted one day was stringy and unpleasant, she noted, and the pudding was “great lumpy suet with treacle”. She repeatedly presses the other s until they approve better quality bedding, takes three old ladies out for a drive, brings the children home to tea, and brings grapes and sits with a dying girl – and when she was shocked to learn the women had no drawers, and no night gowns, she loaned money to the matron to buy material to make them.“The miseries we can’t help there are so sad,” she wrote. “The poor miserable old women in the infirmary who grumble because they are so unhappy and rub each other up, who look on it like a prison, who are in a raw against forgetful relations who clap them in there against their will or by fraud.”“She’s a trooper, our hero,” Overfield Shaw said fondly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f4b9ec8f473c1c82d0e3effd7711d2870bc995/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1272a646421a9427484e68e5199538ed","title":"seven ways to support your immune system","story":"Your body works hard to fight off infections, but there are things you can do to give it a boostMost people know about the benefits of exercise for our hearts, waistlines, muscles and bones. Fewer are aware of how it supports our immune defences, especially as we age. Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2577555a6130b19b567a9d3b3df5e302d55231/184_384_4996_2997/master/4996.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc526dc8be4c3c37ca2538c64bf9693","title":"disappearing jobs around the world in pictures","story":"Before May Day, AFP’s video and photo teams spoke to men and women around the globe whose jobs are becoming increasingly rare as technology transforms societies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76da4af34bb9540d2f117654d2c875f99b9d7eb5/686_591_4583_2750/master/4583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9223deb81c0e185110ea0353f28d47f7","title":"bicep review roundhouse london","story":"Roundhouse, LondonThe Northern Irish dance duo showcase their skill for ping-ponging melody and beautifully tooled drum programming, paired with magnificent visualsBicep cut a relatively rare shape in today’s live music scene – no longer mere DJs, they’re one of the few dance artists (alongside Eric Prydz and a handful more) to have built up a strong live show from their own work. The duo stand fairly statically behind hardware and a laptop as their symbol emerges behind them – a trefoil of three clenched biceps – and it is an apt one, hinting at the macho homosexuality of disco, the Celtic roots of their native Northern Ireland, and the sheer elemental punch of a kick drum.The crowd is predominantly young twentysomethings from the “sesh” generation, all in Champion tees, with Ketflix and Pills on their phones and a propensity to get on each other’s shoulders. They cheer in recognition as familiar licks eke their way into the flowing mix, turning to festival pandemonium as the Indian vocal sample of Rain kicks in, an anthem for yoga-loving Ibizans. The exceptional visuals by Black Box Echo build to fill the stage like psychedelic Lego and, for Opal, Matisse-like colour blocking.Aside from beautifully tooled drum programming – arid snares, clean claves –Bicep’s biggest skill is in melodies that ping-pong around before resolving with gigantic satisfaction. Perhaps the greatest of these, on Aura, is disrupted by a technical glitch, and it knocks the wind from their sails as they go into a pair of tracks made with fellow dance duo Simian Mobile Disco – the first is fussy electro, but the second, the unreleased Zeus, is head-rush tech-house worthy of Anthony “Shake” Shakir.

He would snort anything, swallow anything, smoke anything, but he was afraid of needles, so he wouldn’t inject anything. That saved his life, he thinks.Back in the early 70s, Antopolsky was a longhair, floating around the fringes of the deep south’s singer-songwriter scene. There’s a famous picture, taken on Guy Clark’s front porch, that shows Townes Van Zandt playing a fiddle, Clark playing guitar, his wife Susanna singing, and on the far right a young man, the only one paying attention to the camera. That’s Antopolsky, the picture taken during a short period in 1972 – “it wasn’t that long, maybe five or six weeks I’m a little fuzzy on memory” – when he was travelling around the US with Van Zandt.When the pair reached Houston, Van Zandt decided to indulge himself. “Townes would always tell me, as he tied the rubber band on his arm, ‘Hold that, Daniel.’ He wasn’t afraid of anything. I would look the other way because I couldn’t stand to see a needle. And then Townes would always say, ‘Don’t worry about me Daniel, I’ll take a little nap.’”On this occasion, Van Zandt’s nap went wrong. “After a couple of hours, he was breathing really hard, and his lips were turning blue. And I didn’t know what to do. I was afraid, I was so afraid. I was afraid that he wasn’t going to wake up. I was afraid that the police were gonna come and find the drugs. I was afraid to go to jail. I went and threw the stuff outside underneath some shrubs. I didn’t know what to do, but you’ve seen it on television when somebody has a hard time breathing: push ’em and then to put the air back in ’em you blow in their mouth. I was doing that, and I don’t know for how long. Finally, he got a little better and they came and got him. And later I drove over to the hospital, and the doctor said, ‘Son, you would have got your friend here a minute later, we couldn’t have saved him.’”After that, Antopolsky fled. He fled Texas and he fled musicians. He first went back to Georgia, to Athens and then to his hometown, Augusta. He fled the US – he and a friend travelled around the world, living the life of the carefree hippy traveller: “I was trying to search for meaning, but the truth is, meaning is all around.” He returned home, then in the mid-80s met a French medical student on placement in Georgia, and ended up marrying her. Since 1989, he and Sylvia and their kids have lived on a farm near Bordeaux, she working as a doctor, he raising chickens and children, and writing hundreds of songs, heard by no one but his family. “It’s a house where the kids could be asleep but I could be upstairs till three or four in the morning writing songs. When I think about it, it’s been everything a songwriter could ever dream of.”Except Antopolsky, pushing 70, is now trying to get those songs heard by others. In the past three years he has released four albums, played at South By Southwest, and is playing his first solo headline show in London at Bush Hall this week. This late-life career has been driven by Jason Ressler, who first became a friend, then heard the songs, then started making a documentary about Antopolsky, then persuaded him to record, and is now his manager.The official line is that Antopolsky is the great lost songwriter of the early days of outlaw country (Ressler’s documentary stokes the idea that Antopolsky is Lefty, the lefthanded guitar player, in Van Zandt’s classic Pancho and Lefty, despite Antopolsky himself having no interest in confirming that notion). If anything, though, Antopolsky’s music puts one in mind of a country Daniel Johnston: there’s the same fragile naivety to it (the fact that his most recent record is called Old Timey, Soulful, Hippy-Dippy, Flower Child Songs from the Cosmos … Wow! might give you some idea of the general tenor of things, as might the song Chickens, from his first album, 2015’s Sweet Lovin’ Music, even more so: “Never had a chicken like sweet Loretta  She was grabbed by a fox in nasty weather,” he sings, amid detailing the character traits of his various fowl). “I’ve got nature songs and funny songs and they sound simple,” Antopolsky says. “But with simple things, deeper things come out sometimes. And they’re not all simple. But it’s like a book. Sometimes the cover doesn’t tell it all but we’re attracted by the cover.”Actually, that’s not all he says at that point. Antopolsky talks in long, rambling paragraphs that veer wildly off topic, punctuated with giggles. The remark about his songs is only a preface: it leads on to him talking about his elephant (“it’s really just a trimmed hedge that was made into an elephant 29 years ago”), how he feels claustrophobic, barbecuing in the Georgia woods as a boy, living in valleys in Hawaii, getting “lungs full with whatever within 12 hours” of being in Tokyo (“I didn’t stay long”) and the merits of Hong Kong’s carless island Cheung Chau. He is a very hard man to keep to the point, and it’s not helped by the fact that he is feeding his chickens and walking around his land as he talks to me by phone. He pauses at one point to try to get a chicken to say “hello” to me.But it’s hard to begrudge him. After all, his has not been an easy life. The fear of needles came from watching his mother, he says: she died when he was 10, and he had been disturbed by years of treatment for Parkinson’s. His father died when he was 17, and though he had older brothers, he was fundamentally on his own. “Not long after that I went off to university,” he says. “I was just wild, with no parents to come home to. Of course, if my father would have seen the hair and the beads, I would have had to answer to him.” He then narrowly avoided the draft, and began the years of itinerant living: “I bought an old Volkswagen van and just hit the road.”Talking to Antopolsky, you get the impression he would gladly have done without taking his music public. When he went to SXSW, his first reaction was to be “petrified … It’s not for me”, though he enjoyed being cheered to the rafters. Recording his first album, Sweet Lovin’ Music, in Nashville was a trial because he wasn’t allowed to simply play his songs with his own accompaniment: “I’d never had those ear things, those headphones, and I had to hear the backup and sing with it, and I’d never sung without a guitar.”So it’s easy to believe him when he says he was happy keeping his hundreds of songs to himself for all these years. “Things ripen,” he says, “and when they ripen, there’s hardly no reason to discuss it. We get ourselves in a lot of trouble when we say, ‘I wish things weren’t this way.’ We’ve got to deal with what’s real.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb413fa9479d4d4a226af8ed512738d47e6043b/0_8_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b305bc0ba61b290e8dcf460ad0900fef","title":"hes a classic arch thatcherite readers on sajid javid as home secretary","story":"After Amber Rudd resigned following the publication of a deportation targets letter, you’ve been sharing your reaction Javid is a classic arch-Thatcherite his ethnicity doesn’t enter into it. He voted for every policy that created the current disaster that is the Home Office. He will do absolutely nothing to improve the situation.Javid’s appointment was the obvious no brainer appointment as home secretary. It also puts him a very strong position to take over from May should she be pushed under the wheels of a bus by furious Brexiteers or when she eventually steps down voluntarily. It also opens up a whole new possible Tory voter demographic against Labour under Corbyn should the above happen. There is no way a Brexiteer (I totally discount Gove, Johnson, Fox, Leadsom or Davis as serious contenders) could unite the Tory party in the event of May’s political demise and must also be a set back for Hunt and Williamson’s leadership ambitions.No surprises there then - Sajid Javid certainly fits the image the Tories want to portray while being a loyal ally. The noose still needs to tighten around the neck of May though, but we all know that senior Tories need her in place to take the crap for Brexit. What political intrigue we have.Had to be Javid, not much choice out of the ghastly MPs on offer. I don’t have any time for him myself, I don’t think he has been a very successful minister for housing and I think he is more a stop gap until the next reshuffle.Well, that was all a bit embarrassing wasn’t it. No minister in the past would have carried on in the way Rudd has done, but at last she has done the right thing unlike many of her peers in the current Tory party that continue to cling on. Where does this leave May? Exposed, that’s where. She was the architect of the hostility to immigrants policy, the buck stops with her. And then there’s Brexit. How can the government carry on pretending it has the authority, and the backing from the British people, to carry on imposing Brexit on us?After reading about Windrush, why should anyone in the EU27 trust the UK Home Office to protect the rights of EU27 citizens living in the UK post-Brexit? Mr Barnier should insist on a strong role for the European Court of Justice regarding those rights post-Brexit.Oh look, Theresa May has thrown another person under the bus. At a point, this tactic of blaming somebody else for her own blunders will fail because there will be no more people left to throw under the bus. This policy was as much her baby’s as Rudd’s. I hope Rudd’s resignation will not be the end of it.Do strong and stable governments typically see four cabinet ministers resign in disgrace within six months?This week could be brilliant. We’ve had a ministerial resignation, next up the palaver over the new minister, then a massive kicking for the Tories at the local elections. I suspect Boris will see this as his opportunity and will strike with all his snake-like guile and May will go. Then all we need is for Boris to be Boris and this government will come crashing down.Tomorrow is the beginning of May. And also the end of May, hopefully."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1adadb56a68b5f9c4fa30b6431fbca19c1c08e15/367_153_2810_1686/master/2810.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87a306502d1e9ddda754b372ce83d01","title":"penny mordaunt adds women equalities ministerial role","story":"International development secretary is fourth MP to take on the responsibilities in two yearsPenny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, has added women and equalities to her brief – although it does not necessarily sit neatly with her main role.The job has changed hands four times in two years. Amber Rudd, who resigned as home secretary on Sunday, had only been tasked with the additional role since the former education secretary Justine Greening left the government in the January reshuffle.The Women’s Equality party said the repeated appointments showed the brief had “repeatedly been treated as of secondary importance by the Conservatives, passed around like an inconvenient add-on rather than being treated with the seriousness that it deserves and needs”.The role may yet be a time-consuming one, with plans to update the Gender Recognition Act to ease the process for trans people to legally change their gender, a pledge originally made by Greening. Mordaunt is a well-liked and opinionated Brexiter who had been in the frame for promotion for some time before replacing Priti Patel at the Department for International Development (DfID), though her armed forces background both as a Royal Navy reservist and minister meant many thought she would have been better suited replacing Michael Fallon as defence secretary.She has been an outspoken champion of widening participation for women in the armed forces, once telling a cheeky anecdote in the Commons about sitting through a naval training session on how to care for your penis and testicles in the field.On LGBT issues, there is relatively little on the public record, though she backed equal marriage in 2013, and as minister for the armed forces ordered a pilot project to explore registering Ministry of Defence sites for same-sex unions.She came to wider public prominence with her participation in ITV’s celebrity ing competition Splash!, in which she only managed a belly flop but donated £7,000 of her fee to the renovation of a lido in her Portsmouth North constituency.Like her predecessor Patel, Mordaunt was an enthusiastic leave campaigner and caused a damaging split within the Conservative party after a controversial appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, when she incorrectly suggested Britain would not have a veto on Turkey joining the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab1db564261fa74b9ce3c05ea5dcb04508730ca3/0_102_1381_828/master/1381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5484b5773bc20549ee95e159e063f424","title":"sajid javid replaces amber rudd as home secretary","story":"Sajid Javid has been appointed as home secretary, replacing Amber Rudd who resigned after repeatedly struggling to account for her role in the unjust treatment of Windrush-generation migrants.Theresa May announced Javid’s appointment on Monday morning, installing the communities secretary to the Home Office where his first job will be to deal with the ongoing immigration debacle.He is the first BAME politician to hold the role and his appointment could offer hope to critics that the government is aware of how damaging the issue has been for community relations and trust in the immigration system.The new home secretary is the first BAME holder of one of the great offices of state, a former investment banker and Margaret Thatcher devotee who is on the right of the Conservative party. His appointment will keep the balance of EU leavers and remainers in the top offices, but only just. Javid backed remain, but with some hesitation.Born in Rochdale in 1969, he is – like the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan – a Muslim son of a bus driver who has risen to the top of British politics. His parents were born in India, but fled to Pakistan. His father arrived in Britain in the 1960s – Javid has said he came with £1 in his pocket.After leaving banking for politics in 2010, the MP for Bromsgrove rose quickly, beginning as parliamentary private secretary to George Osborne before continuing as a protege of the former chancellor in junior roles at the Treasury.He got his first cabinet job in just his fourth year in parliament when he was appointed culture secretary in 2014, and was appointed business secretary after the 2015 election.After an abortive attempt with his friend\u0026nbspStephen Crabb to mount a bid for the leadership, where he would have been chancellor, he took the communities brief under Theresa May. His biggest challenge has been the Grenfell Tower disaster, where the government has faced criticism for stalling on promises to the victims’ families.James Brokenshire, the former Northern Ireland secretary and longtime May ally, who stood down in January to have a tumour removed from his lung, was moved to Javid’s former job as housing, communities and local government secretary.The mini-reshuffle was completed by the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, taking on the additional role of minister for equalities, held by Rudd.After the announcement, Javid said his “most urgent task” was to get to grips with the Windrush crisis, and ensure those affected “are all treated with the decency and the fairness they deserve”.But speaking to BBC News, he declined to say whether this might bring an end to the so-called hostile environment immigration policy, or to targets for net removals.“We’re going to have a strategy in place that does something the previous home secretary set out last week when she made a statement to parliament – to ensure that we have an immigration policy that is fair, it treats people with respect, and with decency,” he said.“That will be one of my most urgent tasks, to make sure that we look carefully at the policy and make sure it achieves just that – fairness.”The home secretary, whose parents emigrated from Pakistan in the 1960s, spoke at the weekend about his initial reaction to news of the treatment of Windrush-generation migrants. “I thought that could be my mum … my dad … my uncle … it could be me,” he said.Javid, 48, said he recognised the scandal could cause concern among ethnic minority voters but issued a plea to those who were wavering to look at the government’s attempts to “put things right”.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.The Home Office, one of the major offices of state, is a notoriously difficult department to run, with many secretaries having been forced to quit as a result of errors.Dealing with the Windrush crisis, as well as the underlying problems around immigration, will be top of Javid’s inbox. However, tackling rising knife crime, fighting to justify policing cuts and handling the ongoing terrorism threat are all key issues.In appointing Javid, May has attempted to maintain the delicate balance in her cabinet between remainers and Brexiters, which is particularly important because the home secretary sits on the Brexit “war cabinet”, which meets this week. While Rudd was a clear advocate of staying in the European Union, within days of the referendum Javid, who had campaigned to remain, insisted the result must be respected. And while his predecessor was a strong voice around the cabinet table for staying in the customs union, the new home secretary has made clear he is sceptical of softer Brexit options.Javid, like Rudd a George Osborne protege like Rudd, was previously a minister in the Treasury. His first cabinet appointment came in 2014 as culture secretary. The former investment banker has also served as business secretary. His 18 months running the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has been dominated by the fallout from the fatal Grenfell Tower fire, and pressing for more house building despite resistance from the Treasury.Rudd was forced to step down after a series of revelations in the  about problems faced by Windrush-generation residents, which culminated in a leak on Friday that appeared to show she was aware of targets for removing people who were in the country illegally.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.Rudd was facing a bruising appearance in the House of Commons on Monday, which government insiders suggested she was keen to avoid.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the replacement of Rudd would mean nothing unless the hostile environment policy on immigration was finally ended.“Sajid Javid’s first priority must be ending this hostile environment policy. As the Windrush scandal has proven, and as some of us warned the government four years ago, this policy has ripped lives apart, including the lives of British nationals and others who have the right to be here.“The new home secretary cannot form another human shield for Theresa May. The prime minister still has serious questions to answer about how this scandal was allowed to happen, and whether she knew Amber Rudd was misleading parliament and the public last week.

Compared with people who adopted none of them, men and women who adhered to all five saw their life expectancy at 50 rise from 26 to 38 years and 29 to 43 years respectively, or an extra 12 years for men and 14 for women.“When we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer. But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was,” said Meir Stampfer, a co-author on the study and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.The researchers performed the analysis in the hope of understanding why the US, which spends more on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than any other nation, ranks 31st in the world for life expectancy at birth. According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy at birth in 2015 was 76.9 and 81.6 years old for US men and women respectively. The equivalent figures for Britain are very similar at 79.4 and 83 years old.The five healthy habits were defined as not smoking having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25 taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men and having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar.Given that the habits of a healthy lifestyle are well known, the mystery is why we are so bad at adopting them, said Stampfer. Part of the problem is that many people struggle to give up smoking, and the continuous peddling of unhealthy food, as well as poor urban planning, which can make it hard for people to exercise, also feed in, he said.“I do think people need to step up and take some personal responsibility, but as a society we need to make it easier for people to do that,” he said. “People can get stuck in a rut and think it’s too late to change their ways, but what we find is that when people do change their ways, we see remarkable benefits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eabc48a25897572716803b7e780d29c6c251a43/0_89_960_576/master/960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52c1bfac09480f9dee88157d20ea5108","title":"woman with aspergers ejected from cinema for laughing at western","story":"Tamsin Parker, 25, was removed for laughing during The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in LondonThe British Film Institute has apologised after staff forcibly removed a woman with Asperger syndrome from the cinema in what onlookers described as a “disgusting” sign of “naked intolerance”.Tamsin Parker, 25, an artist and animator, was watching a screening at the BFI’s cinema on London’s South Bank of her favourite film – the spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, directed by Sergio Leone – with two friends. She was asked to leave for laughing too loudly.Her mother added: “She was completely humiliated and it ruined her birthday.”The BFI released a statement saying it was sorry and had got it wrong in a “challenging and complex situation”.“We are taking this situation extremely seriously and this morning we have been investigating further ... We can and must do better in accommodating all the needs of our customers and we will be addressing what additional provisions and staff training we can put in place,” the institute said.Parker’s mother, who is speaking to a lawyer about what happened, said: “It would be nice to arrange a screening for Tamsin and her friends. The manager did not seem very apologetic at the time.” Parker was eager to see the BFI screening and has watched the film eight times, according to her mother, who went to collect her daughter after she was thrown out. “She was in floods of tears ... she was really scared,” her mother said.Lydia Parker, a theatre director, said it had been heartening to see messages of support on Twitter. The story has been shared widely on social media, with people voicing concern.One cinemagoer, Lloyd Shepherd, expressed his disgust after the incident. “She’d been laughing very loudly, but at moments which were supposed to be funny. Some people complained. She was dragged out shouting: ‘I’m sorry, I have Asperger’s.’ She was incredibly upset,” he said.He said some people applauded her removal while others were upset, with a large number leaving.“I am shaking with anger. That poor, poor woman. Just a little bit of empathy and everything would have been fine. Such naked intolerance. In the middle of London. Disgusting,” Shepherd said.Parker’s sister, Sabrina Parker, tweeted that she had taken her sibling home to watch the rest of the movie. “Thank you for sharing this ... we’re horrified that they would treat her so badly,” she wrote. “Obviously she’s still very upset. It’s her favourite movie and it was her 25th birthday celebration.”The National Autistic Society said many autistic people felt venues were not autism-friendly enough, which is why it runs the autism friendly award to encourage businesses to be more accessible. The charity added that it works with cinemas and theatres to hold autism-friendly screenings.Jane Harris, the NAS’s director of external affairs, said the incident was shocking and a colleague was at the screening, “along with others who were equally distressed by what they had witnessed”.“It’s great to hear that so many audience members were sympathetic, but this incident shows just how far we have to go for autistic people to get the understanding they deserve,” she added.Harris said the NAS would be reaching out to the BFI to discuss ways to improve its staff members’ understanding of autism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d548975e44b067d6715a82120969197f8dd49102/250_543_4026_2417/master/4026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=658833bdb5cd3088be50981097d95a21","title":"garbine muguruza athlete feminine tennis wimbledon interview","story":"“Words like ‘feminine’ and ‘fighter’ can go together,” Garbiñe Muguruza says with charming force on a cold but sun-kissed morning in Madrid. “You can be feminine and you can say, ‘I really want to beat her. But I don’t want to look like a little monster in the corner.’ I want to take this wall down which says you are one thing or the other. If you are a feminine athlete people say: ‘Oh, she wants to be a model or she’s not concentrating.’ No. We are concentrating.”Muguruza, the current Wimbledon champion and world No 3, is a formidable competitor who is proud she beat Serena and Venus Williams in the finals of the two grand slam tournaments she has won so far. In a ridiculously stylish hotel she is also relaxed and refreshingly forthright.“It’s a delicate thing because for some people it’s very hard to allow an athlete to be feminine. For me it’s easy. I want to fight on court but I also want to wear something I like. You can be angry and competitive and a fighter and you can also be nice and wear something by Stella McCartney. I feel good in that and it’s important for your esteem because you’ve got to be resilient. I’m a tennis player, and that’s my priority. I like fashion but I would never want to be a model. I don’t want to forget what I’m good at because, as soon as you do, you’re screwed.”The 24-year-old Spaniard, who was born in Venezuela, smiles at that blunt truth as the clay court season gathers pace with the Madrid Open starting on Sunday. And when Muguruza tells me about being invited to the Oscars in March, she ensures that the most telling line is one where her concern for ordinary woman is obvious. “I wore black,” she says, in honour of the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment, “but it wasn’t like the Golden Globes where everybody wore black. It’s a problem that was quiet before but it was there all the time. It got more exposure because the women who spoke out are famous and it’s Hollywood. If an Oscar-winner speaks about it then it goes everywhere. But if the waitress says this has happened to her nobody really listens.”The impact of that last sentence is powerful – and Muguruza nods calmly. “It’s everywhere.”Muguruza also met Billie Jean King, whose defeat of Bobby Riggs in 1973 has been turned into a Hollywood film. “I want to see it because I heard it’s good,” Muguruza says of Battle of the Sexes, which captures the way King took on Riggs and sexism. “But, usually, when I watch a movie I want to see Fast and Furious or the Expendables. I just want to chill out, turn up the volume and stare at the screen.”She laughs at her terrible taste in movies before acknowledging the debt all female tennis players owe to King and another pioneer for equality in Venus Williams. Women now receive the same pay as men in grand slam tournaments. “I speak to other athletes and they don’t have the impact, the money and equality we have. It’s getting better and better in tennis and hopefully it can soon be completely equal in all tournaments. But in other sports it’s not like that.”Muguruza won £2.2m after beating Venus Williams in the Wimbledon final last year but the tennis circuit, particularly for lower-ranked players, is testing. “Tennis is very lonely,” she stresses, “especially when you are younger and don’t have family around. It can just be you and your coach in China. But everybody is in the same situation. You have to be a young old lady – that’s how I call myself sometimes. You have incredible moments and very bad moments when you are alone. You miss your family but tennis just lasts for a short period. You make sacrifices but I don’t miss having a young life. I’m happy and very privileged.”Four years ago, at the French Open, Muguruza’s full power was revealed for the first time when she gave Serena Williams the worst beating of her illustrious career in the second round. “It was an incredible match nobody was expecting. If you told me before I was going to win 6-2, 6-2 I would be surprised. But I never stopped believing I could beat anybody – even if Serena is one of the best players in history. She was one of the women I watched on TV as a kid.”In 2016 Muguruza won her first grand slam, at the French, when she again beat Williams in straight sets in the final. “I was nervous because I had made the 2015 Wimbledon final but it only matters that Serena won. Yeah, I played well but who cares about the loser? So in the French I was like, ‘I don’t want to lose again.’ I was also motivated because beating a Williams sister has extra value. If you win a grand slam by beating them it feels more important. It was an explosion of happiness.”Last year was much more difficult in Paris when, in the fourth round, she lost to the local favourite Katrina Mladenovic. Muguruza’s errors were cheered and she left the court visibly upset. “The crowd was very involved and with her. It’s normal. But I had tears in the press conference and showed people how athletes feel. Some people were surprised but I’m like: ‘Come on, I’ve been three hours on court and it’s emotional. That’s what everybody does in the locker room but you don’t see them.’ It was good in the end because I expressed myself and showed I am human. The French Open will always be the most special tournament to me. It was my first grand slam and the tournament I wanted to win when I was little.”Winning Wimbledon was thrilling last year. “I was emotional because when I lost to Serena in 2015 I didn’t know if I’d get another chance as grass is unpredictable. So to beat Venus and win it two years later? I was like: ‘Whew!’”Muguruza, who jokes about her serious salsa dancing, was mortified at the Wimbledon dinner. “People had told me, ‘There’s a ball and you can dance.’ I’m like, ‘Oh my God I’m going to dance with Roger Federer? Yes, I’m ready for that.’ Then someone told me there’s not a dance since 1992. ‘What?’”Muguruza opens her eyes in horror before smiling. “A ball for Wimbledon is serious, elegant, classy. You can’t do the conga but I was ready for everything!”She has a chance of winning both the French and Wimbledon again this year – because she clearly raises her game in major tournaments. Her recent tour win in Monterrey gave her a sixth WTA title – but there was a time when her four tournament wins included two grand slams. Her inconsistency almost amuses her.Beyond her drive to win the most important titles, Muguruza’s rounded attitude means she has begun to explore her interest in fashion design. “My mum and I always talk about it because her dream was to be a designer. Of course I’m always wearing sports clothes so, even more, I want to wear high heels. I’ve now started to do some designs. I take my tablet when I’m travelling and I look at magazines and make notes. Then I design the way I like. It’s good to escape because since I was very young everything has been tennis, tennis, tennis. Now I have more perspective and space in my head. I take a few hours to do something fun for myself. It’s healthy. So when the time is right it will be OK for me to close this chapter on tennis. I’ll probably have a family and do something related to fashion.”Her ease in front of the camera is obvious when she slips into the hotel garden for the photo shoot, but Muguruza is fiercely competitive and says: “I also fear the end because tennis is a life. I’m happiest when I win. You enjoy not knowing if you’re going to win and you can love hating the court.”Muguruza, a feminine fighter and a champion, breaks into a helpless smile. “When you shake hands, and think, ‘Yes, I won,’ that’s such a good feeling. All the hours of training feel worth it. So the best moment is when it’s over and you’ve won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe12d683134463c7fad18f32a9091b2180394d34/289_369_4043_2426/master/4043.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ea6c1d3ac3acc4cd26406bbfd925f10","title":"county cricket somerset v yorkshire lancashire v surrey and more live","story":"Famous last words from Tanya... another wicket down at Old Trafford.

Our hope is that you’ll have more time to do what matters most to you – create, play, work or simply do what you love,” said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group.That’s what was reported earlier in the year, but Microsoft has made the wise choice to simplify the name this time round. Instead of trying to work out which year the Fall or Spring might be in, now we’ve got month and year, which makes a lot more sense.It’s true. The update has only just squeaked in at the last minute to make it into April. It was scheduled to be released a couple of weeks ago, but a bug found at the last minute by testers had to be fixed before it was released beyond the early adopter “Windows Insider” community.Most people will probably get the update after April as it gradually rolls out.The easiest way is to wait for the notification from Windows Update, which lets the user know a feature update is ready to install, but you can also manually check for updates from the Settings app. Failing that you can manually download the latest version of Windows 10 direct from Microsoft and upgrade from that.In a word, yes. While there are ways to stop Windows 10 from downloading it, Microsoft only supports older versions of Windows 10 for two years or less from release.That means that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was released in August 2016 is no longer supported and will not receive further bug fixes and security updates. The Creators Update, released in April 2017 will no longer be supported from 9 October this year, so the only way to keep using a supported version of Windows 10 is to keep upgrading.The biggest and most obvious change is the addition of a timeline feature to the task view. Essentially a history of the apps and files you had open earlier that day or week, Timeline allows you to see what you were doing on the PC you’re currently using and other devices, and resume from where you left off.As Microsoft’s apps on other platforms gain Timeline support their activities will show up on your PC. One of the first is Microsoft Edge for Android and iOS.Focus Assist is a beefed-up version of Do Not Disturb. You can turn it on manually or set it up on a schedule, and it’ll block notifications and other distractions until you’re done. At the end it’ll provide a summary of what happened while you were doing whatever it was you were doing.Like a DND mode you can whitelist certain people so that their emails and messages get through, even when you’re trying to concentrate.Microsoft is pushing improved dictation as a feature of the April 2018 update. In any text box you can now hit the Windows Key + H and start talking.Microsoft’s virtual assistant gets some new powers with the April 2018 update. It will now suggest tasks you might want to resume from previous devices, tapping into the Timeline feature. Support for some smart home appliances has also been rolled out, including Google’s Nest thermostat, and natural language voice control for third-party apps such as Spotify is also being added.Still seeking to convince people to use it over Chrome, Microsoft’s Edge browser gains the ability to strip out clutter when you print from a website, and the ability to mute audio from specific tabs. Some new Grammar Tools will also help break down complex words into syllables and highlight nouns, verbs and adjectives. That adds to several other ebook, design and gesture support improvements.Microsoft has implemented its own version of Apple’s AirDrop, sending files over Bluetooth and wifi without having to mess about with cables. You can limit it to just your devices or any Windows 10 device. How useful the feature turns out to be depends on how many Windows 10 devices you have around you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ae9356b9775851d803bf36928babac02923ad2/0_91_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8ac94825462cdc3c5be1a376f6f6d77","title":"does human planet bbc have to be as accurate as the news","story":"The nature show has been pulled by the broadcaster after questions were raised over the veracity of some scenes. But some argue that even if film-makers cheated, it is still far from fake newsOn Friday morning, at 9.30am, I bought and watched the fourth episode of the 2011 BBC natural history series Human Planet on Amazon Prime. Just over an hour later, the show was no longer for sale. This digital extinction seemed to be part of the BBC’s attempt to remove, for the moment, any trace in any place of the eight-part series. The move follows the BBC’s announcement on Thursday that Human Planet will be subjected to a “full editorial review” after allegations that some sequences misrepresented their content. The BBC said on Friday afternoon that all online and high-street stores have been asked to stop selling the DVDs immediately.  The most recent BBC statement acknowledged that a sequence in episode one, in which an Indonesian hunter named Benjamin Blikololong was shown catching a whale with a harpoon, was not now considered an “accurate” representation of the event. Earlier this month, the BBC withdrew episode four from circulation for re-editing of footage of what was said to be a traditional 100-ft-high tribal tree-house, which turned out to have been constructed for the purposes of filming. The fact that the whole series was still available to buy on DVD almost 24 hours after the announcement of its withdrawal underlines the complexity, in the modern viewing universe, of stopping people watching content that has become contentious. In the past, a broadcaster would simply remove a tape from its archive and order it never to be reshown. TV now, however, has a tail longer than any creature filmed by the BBC Natural History Unit. Although seven years old, Human Planet was available on Amazon and Netflix (which removed it from the menu on Thursday) – and these are only two of the 25 streaming services or overseas broadcasters that currently have contracts to screen the series. The speed and thoroughness of the BBC’s hunt once the veracity of the programme was questioned shows how seriously the organisation is taking issues of editorial integrity, even in non-journalistic programming. This vigour can be interpreted as another skirmish in the current culture wars. Although Benjamin Blikololong of Lamalera and President Donald Trump of Washington DC occupy very different worlds, the former has been retrospectively caught in the backwash from the latter. The campaign, started and stoked by Trump, to expose what activists call “fake news” in what they term “the mainstream media”, led long-term news providers to emphasise their editorial standards. The BBC has explicitly presented itself as a trustworthy source of reporting in muddled times, introducing, for example, an online and on-air service called “Reality Check”, which scrutinises and adjudicates on claims made by politicians and lobbyists. This approach was seen by some, though, as more-wholly-credible-than-thou, and has encouraged them to fact-check the BBC’s content for slips from the virtues it advertises. Human Planet can be seen as a victim of this process even Sir David Attenborough – the patron saint of the genre – has faced some questions over alleged sleight of camera in some of his work. Some practitioners of natural history TV also complain privately that two pressures on broadcasting are in conflict. The increasing requirement for shoots to meet health and safety rules can, they argue, make it harder to capture footage that is always rawly authentic. The genre’s single most celebrated moment is David Attenborough playing with a family of Rwandan gorillas in Life on Earth in 1978 some believe that it would now be impossible to secure insurance or BBC risk-assessment clearance for such an encounter.  But the most fundamental question the “full editorial review” of Human Planet will have to address is whether a natural history programme can and should be held to the same obligations as BBC News. Drama – another non-journalistic genre that has faced the attention of fact-checkers – now routinely precedes pieces with a disclaimer explaining that some details have been altered for narrative purposes. It may be that one outcome of the row will be an attempt to position nature shows as entertainment, rather than a journalism of fur and ferns. At the moment, the BBC’s publicly published guidelines for those working in the form warn: “We must apply the same value of truth and accuracy to Natural History output as we apply to all BBC factual output. Audiences should never be deceived or misled by what they see or hear.”  The BBC belief is that these recently revised guidelines – in association with enhanced “values” training for staff – would mean that the contested sections of Human Planet would not now be filmed or presented in the way they were then. A BBC source said: “We’re talking about issues involving a series shown seven years ago.” One outcome of the editorial review may be the release of a re-edited new version.  There is no reason to think, it was stressed, that the controversy represents a wider problem. But, as the truth wars continue, Human Planet may not be the last programme from the past to be harpooned for fake views."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af8184cb1d1af8ab322c3ccc74f27e198528af8c/0_215_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3650c509a435673372cea6ea993a7d75","title":"sidelined china seeks to maintain influence as ties between north korea and us improve","story":"Improved relations between the former foes could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outsideDuring North and South Korea’s historic summit on Friday, China was notably quiet. Chinese officials and state media focused instead on president Xi Jinping’s meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and a visit by Xi to China’s Yangtze river. After the summit, China’s ministry of foreign affairs released a short statement saying Beijing “welcomed” the results of the talks. “China stands ready to continue to play its positive role to this end,” it added, according to Xinhua news agency. Then, on Monday, China’s foreign ministry announced it was sending its top diplomat, foreign minister Wang Yi, to visit North Korea this week.The visit comes as China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, moves to reassert itself in quickly moving peace talks with the formerly isolated Korean state. China has long said that North Korea’s nuclear programme is for Washington and Pyongyang to work out between themselves. But now warming ties between North Korea and the US could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outside.Kim said on Friday he is willing to give up nuclear weapons if the US promises not to invade and commits to a formal end to the Korean War that ended with an armistice in 1953. Kim and US president Donald Trump could meet within the next month.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit here“So now things are out of China’s control and it is no surprise that it is being excluded from the discussions.”While talks between North and South Korea and Washington fit China’s interest in stability on the Korean peninsula, Beijing is also worried about an unfavourable regional strategic balance unfolding.China will still be part of any discussions over a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice signed by China, the US and North Korea in 1953, ending more than three years of fighting between the North and the South. A trilateral summit in May between Japan, South Korea, and China will also provide Beijing another chance to exert influence, according to Kovrig. “Politically, I think China is being careful to give North and South Korea the space to advance the diplomatic process, because that’s in Beijing’s interest. Watching closely and working behind the scenes to position itself,” said Kovrig."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3474063.1524672769!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thou shalt obey these 24 consumer commandments","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPricewatch reckons a good consumer needs to follow 24 commandments to make sure they get the most out of lifeMoses figured 10 commandments were enough to see the world right while Jesus was able to get it down to just two. But Pricewatch reckons that a good consumer needs to follow many more commandments to make sure they get the most out of life. By our count there are 24, in fact.We are all creatures of habit. We tend to shop in the same supermarkets and buy clothes in the same places and stick with the same phone, gas, television and broadband providers, come what may.This is understandable but not clever. Make a point of doing your “big shop” in a different supermarket every now and then. Just to shake things up. And if you have not experienced the delights of the German discounters in a while – and less than 30 per cent of Irish consumers shop in either Aldi or Lidl regularly – then give them a whirl.The quality has improved dramatically in recent years and they will save you money. They will also dramatically reduce the time you spend shopping because they are small and have less than 20 per cent of the stock a really big supermarket operated by their rivals has, so you will be able to zip around. And probably buy some class of weird jack hammer to boot.We throw away as much as a third of the food we buy and appear happy to bin hundreds, if not thousands, of euro each year. Stop doing that by making sure you only buy what you need. Make lists and stick to them.Not long ago we heard a terrible story of a person who ended up paying health insurance on the double for a whole year because they thought they had cancelled with one provider and signed up with another only to find out way down the line that the cancellation had not gone through as they thought.When the company they had tried to leave asked them what date they had made the original cancellation call and who they had spoken to they had no idea. No records mean it is always going to be harder to get redress if things go wrong. So if you are interacting with a company and the outcome matters, take a note of the date and time and the people you were speaking to on your phone.If you are making a complaint write a quick timeline of your grievances and include dates and times of phone calls or other conversations. Write down who you spoke to and what was said.People who shop on impulse rarely make the best decisions. Always ask yourself two questions: do you really need this thing? And is this thing really good value for money?And then go away and think about it for a while.Randomly received text messages and Facebook posts promising you free iPads are always nonsense. Expensive creams will not give you the gift of eternal youth, that expensive diet or homeopathic treatment aimed at taking years off you will not work.And the sub-Saharan princess with a case full of diamonds for you is actually a sweaty man in a wife-beater and Y-fronts who will give you nothing more than endless heartache. And if you ever get an unsolicited email from your bank, from Revenue or anyone else asking for your bank details – or even just your name and email address – it is a scam, no matter how convincing the mail looks.Cooking is cheaper and better for your physical and mental well-being than relying on processed food.Cyclists are healthier than drivers. That is a fact. A couple of years ago the Lancet published a report which showed cyclists to be slimmer and likely to live longer than their car-driving counterparts.Looking at biological data from more than 150,000 people and studying the health of half a million others aged between 40 and 69, scientists definitively concluded that getting on your bike was better for you. Another Danish study showed that regular cyclists live for more than five years longer than non-cyclists. And it will also save you thousands of euro in commuting costs while allowing you to feel super-smug.Generally speaking such diets are expensive and worthless – this is particularly true of detox diets which are just nonsense. Don’t trust anyone who tries to sell anything that claims to be detoxifying unless it is a human organ. And you’re probably better off not trusting someone trying to sell you a liver or a kidney either.For all its faults and for all the recent controversies of recent years, we should still be grateful that Ireland has a good supply of good-quality drinking water which comes from our taps free of charge (yes, yes, yes we know we pay for it through general taxation but you know what we mean).It takes three litres of regular water to manufacture a single litre of bottled water, and that plastic bottle will take at least 500 years to break down, at least until those enzymes that have evolved to eat plastic multiply. And let’s just hope they don’t evolve any further and start eating us.If you happen to be among the 70 per cent of Irish people with private health insurance who has not changed provider for a few years do before your next renewal date.It will save you hundreds of euro each year – and you may even save thousands if you happen to be on a really expensive policy. And if you are canny you should be able to make the savings without losing any real benefits.Remember when switching, providers can’t ask intrusive questions about your health. The only thing they can really ask if if you have health insurance already and, if so, for how long and with which insurer and what level of cover you have.As with health insurance providers, gas and electricity companies profit from our lethargy and ignorance. By switching from one charging you the standard rate to one offering a discounted rate you could easily save more than €200 over the next 12 months.As many as 85 per cent of Irish people pay a higher tariff for both electricity and gas than they need to. And unlike Cornflakes or broadband, there is no difference in the quality of the gas or electricity between the dearest and the cheapest.Every now and then set yourself a challenge to spend nothing for just one day. Then see if you can make it three days. Spending can be a habit and it can be broken.And speaking of spending money, never do your grocery shopping while hungry or your online shopping when you are drunk. Don’t routinely carry your credit cards with you. And avoid the temptation to shop on payday. Anyone who goes into Penneys on the day they get paid is bound to leave with an armful of clothes they are almost certainly going to regret buying.Big companies profit from our unwillingness to even open – never mind actually read and try to understand – the bills and statements they send us either virtually or physically. So make a resolution to pay attention to them. You never know when you are being gouged and by whom.Companies have made it a policy to make resolving problems as difficult as possible. The hope is that difficult customers – and by that we mean anyone looking for help or redress – will just go away. If you have a grievance with a company, persist. Don’t just give up if it seems like too much hassle. That’s just playing into their hands.You don’t want to be the person shouting in a shop because it refuses to sell you the flatscreen telly that was incorrectly priced at 1 cent. Retailers are not obliged to sell you a product just because it has a particular price tag on it.And you do not have the automatic right to a refund or a replacement if a product turns out to be faulty or flawed in some way. A provider can instead offer to repair it. Oh and if you pay a deposit for something and then change your mind, do not automatically assume a provider will give you your money back. They might. But they might not. It depends on the terms and conditions.Working as a shop assistant or in a call centre can be incredibly difficult and not very well paid. If you have a grievance, there is little or no point in shouting at the lowest-paid staff member, the very person who has no power to effect change. Always be polite – and always make sure you are addressing your complaints to the right people.Without generalising overly Americans and Germans are great at complaining while Irish people are rubbish. We hate “making a fuss”. Not even Pricewatch is immune and unless a waiter actually spits in our soup before tipping it into our lap we are likely to say everything is grand even if it tastes like cold vomit. But complaining is good and good businesses want to hear our concerns so they can have a chance to address them.Yes Amazon or Asos or the Honk Kong-based electronic’s retailer Dan’s Dodgy Deals might be cheap but what is the ultimate cost? If we all shop online all the time then local retailers will disappear and we will all be the poorer for that.There is no point in mourning the passing of Clerys or Guineys or wherever if the last time you spent any money there was back when Johnny Logan was asking what another year was.Unless you have friends in Senegal or the Democratic Republic of Congo don’t return a missed call from those places. In fact, if you have a missed call from any exotic looking number don’t call back. It’s almost always a scam.We know that sometimes they are longer than the Bible so a handy way to scan them is to copy the whole thing into a Word document and use Ctrl-F to look for key words you think might be relevant.It is easy to complain in a very public way using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or whatever social media platform you are fond of using yourself. But remember to be polite.These platforms are populated with enough trolls already. And when it comes to sharing personal details on such platforms such as the above, mind yourself and limit the amount of information you put into the public domain.Is there an ombudsman or regulator who can help you out? There is a Financial Services Ombudsman, a Pensions Ombudsman, the Central Bank, a taxi regulator and ComReg, for starters. But remember they can rarely be your starting point, and you will have to exhaust the complaints procedure for that sector and deal with the company before they will entertain you.If you have been let down by a shop or service provider than contact Pricewatch – we might be able to help you out. But please remember we do get a lot of queries and complaints and can’t deal with them all."},{"url":null,"title":"cork looks set to go to the wire in referendum on eight amendment","story":"  April 28, 2018Both sides in abortion referendum believe they have the edge.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Move comes in wake of unclaimed missile strikes on Syrian air bases on SundayEleven children killed in further attack on foreign forces in south of AfghanistanUS secretary of state reassures Riyadh that US will abandon Iran nuclear deal if talks failResidents have been staging protests since March seeking right of return for refugeesAs he was snatched from his village by Islamic State, Jano\u0026rsquos mother handed him a piece of paper that would save himDonors\u0026rsquo conference clocked just over half of the \u0026euro6.5bn needed to help Syria in 2018Ahmed Abu Hussein worked for Al-Shaab radio and had protective vest marked \u0026lsquoPress\u0026rsquoGovernment U-turn after no African country willing to accept migrants on Israel\u0026rsquos termsHassan Rouhani says US president lacks qualifications to assess nuclear dealDamascus Letter: Residents alternate between \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquowar normal\u0026rsquo livesIsis focus on Arab world may starve western intelligence as affiliate groups go dormantMany children reportedly among dead and injured in attack on party in isolated villageAngel Gahona was reporting on damage done during anti-government protestsOne daughter under investigation for allegedly throwing water at a business meetingTwo Palestinian refugee civilians killed in adjacent Palestinian camp of YarmoukForeign minister says Tehran could restart nuclear activities if Trump exits pactMore than 100 wounded in attack outside voting registration centre in KabulOPCW delegation has reportedly taken samples from the site in DoumaOver 120 wounded, say Palestinian sources, but number protesting falls significantlyAir strikes target rebel enclave as Assad moves to strengthen position near capital"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478923.1525085434!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sajid javid replaces amber rudd as uk home secretary","story":"The British home secretary Amber Rudd has resigned amid outrage over mistreatment of long-term legal residents from the Caribbean who have wrongly been labelled illegal immigrants. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSajid Javid outside the Home Office in Westminster, London, after he was appointed as the new Home Secretary. Photograph: Dominic LipinskiPA WireSajid Javid has been appointed as UK home secretary, replacing Amber Rudd who resigned after repeatedly struggling to account for her role in the unjust treatment of Windrush-generation migrants.UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced Javid’s appointment on Monday morning, installing the communities secretary to the Home Office where his first job will be to deal with the ongoing immigration debacle.He is the first BAME politician to hold the role and his appointment could offer some hope to critics that the government is aware of how damaging the issue has been for community relations and trust in the immigration system.The home secretary, whose parents emigrated from Pakistan in the 1960s, spoke at the weekend about his initial reaction to news of the treatment of Windrush-generation migrants. “I thought that could be my mum? My dad? My uncle? It could be me,” he said.Javid (48) said he recognised the scandal could cause concern among ethnic minority voters but issued a plea to those who were wavering to look at the government’s attempts to “put things right”.The Home Office, one of the major offices of the UK state, is a notoriously difficult department to run, with many secretaries having been forced to quit as a result of errors.Dealing with the Windrush crisis, as well as the underlying problems around immigration, will be top of Javid’s inbox. However, tackling rising knife crime, fighting to justify policing cuts and handling the ongoing terrorism threat are all key issues.A Downing Street statement said: “The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of the Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP as secretary of state for the home department.”James Brokenshire, the former Northern Ireland secretary who stood down in January to have a tumour removed from his lung, was moved to Javid’s old job as housing, communities and local government secretary.The return of the key loyalist, who was a Home Office minister throughout May’s six-year tenure there, was a predictable move from the prime minister, who is said to feel the need to bolster her fragile position with supportive allies.The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, takes on the additional role of minister for equalities.In appointing Javid, May has attempted to maintain the delicate balance in her cabinet between remainers and Brexiters, which is particularly important because the home secretary sits on the Brexit “war cabinet” which meets this week. While Rudd was a clear advocate of staying in the European Union, within days of the referendum Javid, who had campaigned to remain, insisted the result must be respected. While his predecessor was a strong voice around the cabinet table for staying in the customs union, the new home secretary has made clear he is sceptical of softer Brexit options.Javid, a George Osborne protege just like Rudd, was previously a minister in the Treasury. His first cabinet appointment came in 2014 as culture secretary. The former investment banker has also served as business secretary. His 18 months running the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has been dominated by the fallout from the fatal Grenfell Tower fire, and pressing for more house building despite resistance from the Treasury.Ministers moved swiftly to rally round May on Monday, insisting Rudd only stood down because she inadvertently misled MPs, not because of the wider Windrush migration scandal.Rudd was forced to step down after a series of revelations about problems faced by Windrush-generation residents, which culminated in a leak on Friday that appeared to show she was aware of targets for removing people who were in the country illegally.The pressure increased on Sunday afternoon as the  revealed that in a leaked 2017 letter to May, Rudd had told the prime minister of her intention to increase deportations by 10 per cent - seemingly at odds with her recent denials that she was aware of deportation targets.Rudd was facing a bruising appearance in the House of Commons on Monday, which government insiders suggested she was keen to avoid.–  News and Media"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts.

Reports name Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital, or Singapore as possible options.However, Mr Trump made his own preference clear in a tweet on Monday, suggesting that the Peace House in the truce village of Panmunjom, where Kim met South Korean leader Moon Jae-in for a historic summit last Friday, could be a good location.“Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!” he said.Expectations are building for the high stakes summit, scheduled for late May or early June, after a successful meeting between Kim and Mr Moon, during which the two leaders hugged and committed to working towards “complete denuclearisation” and a peace treaty.Their efforts were widely praised for setting a positive tone ahead of talks with Mr Trump, but President Moon argued modestly on Monday that it was the US president who deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end an international standoff with Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme.His suggestion came in response to a congratulatory message from Lee Hee-ho, the widow of late President Kim Dae-Jung, in which she said Mr Moon deserved to win the prize in recognition of his efforts, said an official from the presidential Blue House in Seoul.Mr Dae-Jung won a Nobel himself for his role in the first summit between North and South Korea in 2000, which he achieved by championing the so-called Sunshine policy of engagement with North Korea. There have only been two more summits since, including last Friday’s meeting.But Mr Moon deflected the praise. “President Trump can take the Nobel prize. All we need to take is peace,” he told his senior aides.On Monday it was also revealed that Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, and Kim are exploring a possible meeting to discuss the abduction of Japanese nationals and Pyongyang\u0027s pledge to move towards denuclearisation. Kim told Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, on Friday that he was ready for dialogue with Japan at any time. The message was relayed by Mr Moon in a phone call to Mr Abe on Sunday. South Korean intelligence chief, Suh Hoon, also debriefed the Japanese leader about the inter-Korean summit, during a visit to Tokyo. Mr Abe had expressed deep interest, he later told reporters.Mr Abe is now expected to start taking steps towards arranging the suggested bilateral Tokyo-Pyongyang summit. Before leaving on a five-day Middle East tour, he thanked Mr Moon for his “sincerity” for keeping his word to raise the long-standing and sensitive issue of Japanese abductions with Kim.At least 17 Japanese citizens were abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s to help train their spies, an issue that Mr Abe has repeatedly pledged to tackle throughout his political career.The abductions, in addition to denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, would dominate the agenda of any bilateral summit. However, Japan has reacted cautiously to the joint North-South Korean pledge at Friday’s meeting to work towards “complete denuclearisation”, pointing to the absence of a clear roadmap for doing so.“We shouldn’t be caught up in the moment and swing too far in a reconciliatory direction,” an  anonymous senior foreign ministry official source told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.However, North Korea appears keen to show it is acting in good faith. On Monday, Pyongyang said that it would reset its clocks by half an hour this coming Saturday to realign with South Korea, in the latest conciliatory gesture in leader Kim’s ongoing international charm offensive. Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un meet in the truce village of PanmunjomPyongyang’s time zone has been 30 minutes behind Seoul since 2015, but Kim said it was a “painful wrench” to see clocks showing different times as he met with the South’s President Moon Jae-in for a historic, and amiable, summit on Friday. “Since it was we who changed the time standard, we will return to the original one. You can make it public,” Kim was quoted as saying by Mr Moon’s chief press secretary Yoon Young-chan. His decision was backed by North Korea’s leadership on Monday. State newswire, KCNA, reported that the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly had decreed that the change would be “the first practical step for national reconciliation and unity.”The move will precede a more dramatic pledge by Kim to dismantle his country’s main nuclear testing site, Punggye-ri, at a later date in May, in full view of South Korean and US experts.Both decisions appear to be part of a determined recent effort by Kim to transform his international image from reclusive, war-mongering dictator to that of an international statesman committed to pursuing peace. “Pyongyang Time” was created in 2015 as a swipe at Japan, to cast off the legacy of “Japanese imperialists.” It was enforced on August 15, to mark the 70th anniversary of the country’s independence from Japanese rule at the end of World War II.The proposed meeting with Mr Abe is a sign of rapidly shifting diplomacy in East Asia, and one of several key meetings likely to take place over the next few months. China will also send the government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, to visit North Korea on Wednesday and Thursday, it’s foreign ministry announced on Monday. Friday’s extraordinary meeting, heavy on the symbolism of renewed friendship but short on fresh policy decisions, prompted a mixed response from US officials over the weekend. National Security Adviser John Bolton, a known sceptic towards North Korea, told Fox News that the Trump administration was not “starry-eyed” over Kim’s recent promises, adding that Washington was not ready to ease sanctions before Pyongyang fully committed to denuclearisation. Mr Bolton said the US had the “Libya model” in mind, referring to a 2003 agreement that resulted in the country relinquishing its nuclear weapons. The location of a future summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump was still under negotiation, he said.  “But if, in fact, Kim has made a strategic decision to give up his entire nuclear weapons programme, then I think deciding on the place and date should be fairly easy,” he added. Meanwhile newly appointed secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who met personally with Kim over Easter while still CIA chief, told ABC news that the US had an obligation to find a peaceful diplomatic solution to North Korea’s nuclear weapons issue. He said he saw a “real opportunity” for progress since meeting with Kim, adding that they had a good conversation on the hardest issues that face our two countries.The North Korean leader was prepared to lay out a map that would help us achieve that objective, he said, referring to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.\u0026#39Mind-reading’ tech being used to monitor Chinese workers\u0026#39 emotionsMexico migrant caravan refused entry to US as border processing area ‘full’ Antiques dealer jailed for life for strangling daughter as wife says he should have killed himself Stonehenge tunnel would spoil the view for drivers, says former National Trust chairman Woman with Asperger\u0026#39s removed from Western film screening for laughing too loudlyReviewed: Virgin\u0026#39s three-tier economy class -

They have no need of close inspection. They can be appreciated at a glimpse, without need of visitor centres, car parks, coaches and multimillion-pound tunnels.Why should the overwhelming majority of those who enjoy Stonehenge be deprived of this pleasure at vast public expense to satisfy a profession and a quango? he said. A £27m visitor centre opened at the site in 2013 and visitors can travel to the prehistoric monument by shuttle bus. A footpath allowing them to see the stones for free also opened at the end of last year.Stonehenge | Everything you need to knowPlans for the tunnel were detailed earlier this year and a public consultation ended last week. Highways England is expected to seek Government approval later this year with a view to beginning construction in 2021. The tunnel would then open to the public in 2026. The plans are backed by heritage groups Historic England, the National Trust and English Heritage, which runs the visitor centre. In a statement the three groups said: This is a once-in-a generation opportunity to reunite this severed ancient landscape, to give people the opportunity to tread pathways used by our ancestors, to visit and appreciate the monuments and see and hear wildlife without the intrusion of the traffic and noise from the road.We will continue to engage with Highways England and with international heritage advisors and others to help to achieve the right solution for the World Heritage Site.Last week the International Council on Monuments and Sites criticised the plans, saying the tunnel was too short and that the dual carriageways either side would destroy archaeological treasures. Transport and industry\u0026#39Mind-reading’ tech being used to monitor Chinese workers\u0026#39 emotionsMexico migrant caravan refused entry to US as border processing area ‘full’ Antiques dealer jailed for life for strangling daughter as wife says he should have killed himself Donald Trump suggests Korean truce village as location for Kim Jong-un summitWoman with Asperger\u0026#39s removed from Western film screening for laughing too loudlyReviewed: Virgin\u0026#39s three-tier economy class - gimmick or game-changer?Donald Trump \u0026#39can take Nobel prize\u0026#39 for summit with Kim Jong-un, says South Korean presidentUK weather: Three people swept off pier into the sea as \u0026#39month\u0026#39s worth of rain\u0026#39 and gales batter parts of Britain Son of Chinese government official jailed for beating girlfriend despite her pleas for a lenient sentenceReview ordered of smart motorway speed limits after record fines are handed outComment: We need to give teenagers the tools to participate in the tech revolution Carer who guided pen of dying millionaire as he signed over half his fortune to her stripped of windfall How bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?Flat Earth conspiracy theorists gather to discuss \u0026#39proof\u0026#39 at first UK conventionJapan complains to US after YouTube footage emerges of fighter jet breaking rules on low altitudeThe Woman in White, episode 2 recap: Sir Percival’s villainy goes up a gear, while Blackwater lives up to its nameKim Jong-un\u0026#39s wife emerges as unlikely style iconMore than half of grooming victims are targeted via Facebook We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000033248327_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWlxWmJPgkV9VyUT7QSPhwyHE71Gsgl40id9Lsfrz-Qw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"woman aspergers removed western film screening laughing loudly","story":"She was watching \u0026#39The Good The Bad and The Ugly\u0026#39A woman with Asperger\u0027s was removed from a BFI screening of a Western on her 25th birthday because she laughed too loudly.Angered cinema-goers complained on social media of the naked intolerance after witnessing the woman being taken from the cinema after a complaint that she was being too noisy.The BFI has apologised for getting it wrong after the woman was ejected from the screening of her favourite film – the spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly directed by Sergio Leone.Sabrina Parker, the sister of the women who was removed, demanded an apology from the cinema.She tweeted: This is about my sister, and how they treated her tonight on her 25th birthday celebration as a woman with Aspergers.

Many administrative functions will be duplicated meaning some jobs are highly likely to go.Sainsbury\u0027s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?More importantly, the competition watchdog will investigate the deal which is set to create a combined group with around 360,000 staff and 2,800 outlets.In a similar probe when Morrisons bought Safeway in a far smaller deal in 2003, the regulator forced the supermarkets to offload 53 stores.So a Sainsbury’s-Asda probe would surely require the sale of stores in locations where the combined company would limit choice for shoppers. Coupe admitted as much on Friday morning but said he would miraculously not cut jobs as a result. How?“Even if we have to est stores they will be sold as trading entities,” he said. In other words, a rival will buy them and they will stay open.But just who would snap them up? Only Tesco and Morrisons would remain as potential purchasers out of a new big three of supermarkets.It\u0027s far from certain they would look to acquire large numbers of stores.The space race that saw supermarkets aggressively add new shops throughout the 2000s, particularly large out-of-town locations, is well and truly over. What the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit Sainsbury\u0027s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Sainsbury’s merger with Asda likely to face competition watchdog probeSainsbury’s grows sales but warns bank profits will take a hit in 2018Sainsbury’s share price soars as it unveils details of Asda mergerCustomers habits have changed. Fewer consumers do one big weekly shop, instead preferring regular trips to convenience stores or shopping online.Aldi and Lidl are adding stores at a rapid rate but much of Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s portfolio is likely to be a bad fit for the discounters, both of which favour smaller, more centrally located shops. Some commentators have touted bargain retailers such as B\u0026ampM as potential purchasers.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says it is “inevitable” that the merged company will sell branches and he sees Morrison’s as the prime beneficiary.But it will only buy the profitable stores in good locations that become available. It is too early to say which Sainsbury\u0027s or Asdas will disappear, or even how many, but we can make some guesses. Analysis by Patrick O’Brien, research director at Global Data Retail, found 197 Asda stores that had a Sainsbury’s in the same postcode area (eg PL1). He broke this down further to reveal 75 areas where they are in the same postcode sector (eg: PL1 5). These could be the first for the chop.No plans to close any stores, but with 75 Asda stores in the same postcode district as a Sainsbury\u0027s store (excluding Sainsbury\u0027s Locals) we expect the CMA will demand disposals pic.twitterW2oYyPbr2nOn job cuts, Lim says the merger will speed up a process that has been underway for a decade.“The number of people employed in retail has been shrinking by 1 per cent per year since 2008. The industry doesn’t require as much space and the role of employees is changing. he said.“If the merger does result in redundancies through being forced to sell stores or through cutting back office teams, ultimately this is about making a company that is fit for purpose in the future with a business model that works.”For Sainsbury’s’ and Asda’s executives, the logic behind a £10bn supermarket mega-merger is clear - for shoppers, suppliers and workers the positives are less obvious.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards.  “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the BoE, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards.  “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the BoE, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But even then, Sainsbury\u0027s flagged that sales at Argos fell 1.4 per cent in the third quarter, adding it is cautious about challenging market conditions and the consumer environment.Supermarkets are also battling rising costs linked to the Brexit-hit pound, falling consumer confidence and fierce competition in the sector as Lidl and Aldi continue their relentless march.Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: “The sector received a recent boost from Tesco\u0027s results and long suffering investors will be hoping that Sainsbury\u0027s can also come out with improving news regarding sales. We can expect an update on cost saving measures and the expansion of Argos into its stores.“The crowded marketplace with the rise of Lidl and Aldi makes for a very difficult environment for the group, which has been reflected in the share price performance for many years.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In the context of the Windrush crisis, surely the time has come for the Home Office to put an end to these flights. The public would be horrified if they knew the reality of this process.” Campaigners said the planned deportation flight “beggared belief” after Ms May formally apologised for the treatment of Caribbean families who were welcomed to the UK following the Second World War.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

In particular I will be reallocating £10m with the aim of increasing the number of enforced removals by more than 10 per cent over the next few years: something I believe is ambitious, but deliverable.”As calls mounted for Ms Rudd to resign, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis claimed the figure was merely an “ambition” and she remained unaware of specific local targets.Ms Smith accused both the home secretary and the prime minister of attempting a “cover-up”.“They knew what they were doing, they’re just trying to cover it up,” she added. “Now everything has come out they’re trying to apologise but it doesn’t work.”Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is to be recalled to give evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee (PA)Karen Doyle, national organiser for the Movement for Justice, said the immigrant rights and anti-racist organisation was working on making a submission to the European Court of Human Rights over her case.“Our argument is that the definition the government is working to on Windrush migrants could be widened and the only way that can happen is a full amnesty,” she added.“Notifying people of the charter flight now does seem absolutely crazy, it beggars belief.”The Black Activists Rising Against Cuts group is planning a protest on Tuesday and has started an online petition to stop the “astonishing” flight going ahead.“We oppose such mass deportations and until the government has set out a clear policy on who from Commonwealth countries are protected, they should not be authorising charter flights,” it said.The flights have long been the subject of controversy, with the death of Angolan man Jimmy Mubenga who was fatally restrained on a flight from Heathrow sparking the first national review of practices.In a report published last year, the Independent Monitoring Board Charter Flight Monitoring Team said the treatment of some migrants “fell short” of humane standards.A flight that took 42 people to Jamaica sparked concern about the use of force and restraint, with almost two thirds of detainees held in waist restraint belts.Monitors revealed that detainees had been taken out of immigration removal centres in the dead of night and held on coaches for up to seven-and-a-half hours, before being handed a booklet entitled “Coming Home”.The Home Office declined to comment on the charter flight but responded to MPs’ calls for laws protecting the Windrush generation’s rights by saying they could be guaranteed under existing immigration legislation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As for who is behind this, we don’t know.”He pointed at a study suggesting that sentiments expressed on Twitter could affect the stock market as an indicator of the potential impact but that there was currently no measure of how tweets affected voting.Many of the Twitter bots studied by The Sunday Times shared 15-character alphanumeric usernames and English-sounding women’s names, despite listing their first language as Russian.Much of their activity was conducted in unison, retweeting official Labour accounts, Momentum and unions.Around 80 per cent of the automated accounts had been created after Theresa May called the snap election and became more active at key points including the launch of the Conservative Party manifesto, Manchester Arena bombing and television debates.The vast majority of accounts have now been suspended or removed by Twitter and it is impossible to view their full output, but it seems some were not exclusively political.Twitter works to detect and remove spam accounts (AFPGetty)One bot in the survey, under the name “Denis”, also sent out pornographic images and positive messages about Donald Trump.Ben Nimmo, a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u0027s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told The Independent that the dates the accounts were created pointed to their purpose but they could be used for several aims.“For me the key question is: are these commercial bots that someone hired to amplify political messaging in the UK, or are they dedicated bots that someone set up to generate the political effect themselves?” he asked.Bots can be used for a variety of purposes, including monitoring, marketing or allowing people to buy fake social media followers.Others are governed simply by traffic and interaction, causing them to share tweets on topics that are dominating social media at any given time, as Labour was during the general election.Owners of the networks can be paid to change what bots are programmed to do, seeing some switch between advertising cars and jewellery to political parties, for example.Even the Russian government’s own Internet Research Agency, known as the “troll factory” for its influence operations, periodically hires external botnets to amplify chosen messages.British Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street for the 1922 committee on June 12, 2017 in London, England.

We continue to improve our internal systems to detect and prevent new forms of spam and malicious automation.”The research comes following persistent allegations of Russian influence in foreign elections, which the Kremlin denies, and wider cyber warfare.An unprecedented joint technical alert issued by British and American security services earlier this month said Russian hackers were targeting millions of devices around the world to spy, steal information and build networks for potentially devastating future cyberattacks.The government has announced £150m funding to bolster the NHS’s cyber defences after the devastating WannaCry virus, and intelligence agencies say other parts of Britain’s critical national infrastructure, including energy networks, have been targeted in the past.  or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If you talk to members of the public, they want to be reassured that we are dealing with people who are here illegally.”The revelation will sharpen the focus on the role of the prime minister, the architect of the “hostile environment” policy that ended up persecuting the Windrush generation.Crucially, it is believed that any members of the Windrush generation detained for deportation – or prevented from returning to the UK – would have counted towards the now-revealed forced removal target.Jeremy Corbyn said: “Amber Rudd has been a human shield for Theresa May – and now she has gone.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

She was presiding over, in her terms, the creation of a hostile environment.”However, the prime minister’s spokesman said she no longer received internal briefings about the details of home office targets after leaving the post, in 2016.In the interview, Ms May also rejected suggestions that the departed home secretary had paid the price for her earlier policy decisions.“Amber Rudd was very clear about the reasons why she has resigned – that was because of information she gave to the House of Commons which was not correct,” the prime minister insisted.Amber Rudd’s resignation won’t take the heat off Theresa MayMay ‘pleading’ with EU for access to single market, says BarnierTheresa may suffers sixth defeat in a week in House of LordsMay vows her \u0027hostile environment\u0027 on illegal immigration will stayBrexit negotiators ‘gave EU power to freeze UK out of Galileo project\u0027“If you look at what we’re doing as a government, and have been doing over the years as a government, what we are doing is responding to the need that people see for a government to deal with illegal immigration. That’s exactly what we are doing.”Ms May said the Windrush generation had been “caught up in way that has caused anxiety”, but were now receiving help to secure the documents they needed.“We deal with that, we make sure that people are given the reassurance that they need, but we also need to ensure that we’re dealing with illegal immigration.” she vowed.The prime minister, on a visit to the Labour target borough of Trafford, also sought to scotch Conservative fears that the Windrush debacle will damage the party in Thursday’s local elections.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The British Government needs to come forward now.Despite demands from Sinn Fein to come to some working agreement by June, the chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that June was just a \u0026ldquostepping stone.\u0026nbspMr Barnier said in a news conference: As far as progress and June are concerned, June is in my view a stepping stone for the October European Council, which will be the final council for reaching an agreement on the withdrawal.On Ireland and Northern Ireland, let me be clear once again only Northern Ireland specific solutions will work. We need in fact to agree rapidly by June on several new points.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe need to agree rapidly by June on the scope of all island customs and regulations - the safety and controls that we need to respect the single market. I don\u0027t want to go into details.He stated this isn\u0026rsquot just an Irish issue, but also an EU issue.EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier addresses the Irish border issue with Leo VaradkarThe Democratic Unionist party leader Arlene Foster slammed Mr Barnier for not understanding the \u0026ldquounionist culture of Northern Ireland.She said: \u0026ldquoMichel Barnier\u0027s trying to present himself as someone who cares deeply about Northern Ireland and if that is the case he needs to hear the fact that we are part of the United Kingdom will remain part of the United Kingdom constitutionally, politically and economically.Therefore his proposal of us being in an all-Ireland regulatory scenario with a border down the Irish Sea simply does not work.I don\u0027t think he does understand the wider unionist culture of Northern Ireland.The DUP has strongly opposed an agreement made in December in which North Ireland would remain fully aligned with the EU and the Republic of Ireland if there is no solution to the Irish border.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s patronising rubbish.It’s no surprise that this latest rebellion is being led by the Lib Dems, a party whose anti-Brexit platform was so popular at the last election that they managed to win 12 seats — just under 2 per cent of the Commons.Hardly shocking then that they’re no fans of democracy.What they’re doing is downright dangerous, and not just because a trolling guide produced by one Remoaning pressure group ominously promises “direct action”.The risk is that they put up enough barriers to our departure that the Government ends up compromising on membership of the customs union.That would be a knife in the heart of Global Britain and mean that Brussels bureaucrats would still be setting the rules.That simply cannot happen.The Prime Minister must stand firm.THE tragic death of Alfie Evans has touched the nation.There are real questions to be asked about who has the final say on treatment for terminally-ill children.But for now those debates should be put to one side.Our hearts go out to his parents who have fought so hard to give their son a chance.We also want to offer a tribute to the NHS staff who did all they could for him.And who will do the same, again and again, for hundreds of kids in the future.MO Salah is one of those sportsmen that you just want to succeed.But he’s proved himself much more than just a footballer.He’s broken down walls between different communities and has given back to those in his home town who weren’t blessed with such a cultured left foot.

She is believed to have been impregnated using the 65-year-old’s sperm and a donor egg.The adoptive parents spent more than £100,000 on the procedure and used a clinic abroad as most in the UK would not deal with a couple their age.The child’s British birth mother and her husband were named on the birth certificate, but they signed a parental order letting the older couple adopt.Social services closely monitored the situation and, after the concerns were raised, the child was taken away and is thought to be in foster care.The adoptive parents have failed in one bid to regain custody but are still fighting. They are thought to be allo-wed some contact in monitored visits.The source said: “This is a very unusual situation.

It is absolutely unacceptable.”Russia has already been accused of using such tactics to back President Donald Trump in the 2016 American election.However this is the first time that it has been documented in the 2017 general election, in which Corbyn had an extraordinary success and defied all predictions.GOT a story?

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m a little and Johnny is my daddy.“My little age is five, which just kind of fits me. I don’t really ever go lower or move higher than that. That’s what I am comfortable with. That’s what I like.”Max has a list of rules to obey, including no tantrums, no back talk and no staying up past bedtime - and gets banished for a timeout in the naughty corner if she breaks them.She said: “Sometimes if I’m bad my daddy takes away my phone, or I don’t get to watch TV for a certain amount of time, or I have to go to bed early.“But the worst one is being put in timeout because I just have to sit there in the corner and stare at the wall and do nothing - that is not fun at all.”Johnny regularly reads Max a bedtime story before putting her down for her daily nap, after she’s tired herself out playing with her dolls and colouring books.And if Max has been especially good, he takes her to the nearby park to play on the swings and the slide.Max first became a “little” aged 18 after discovering the DDLG community on YouTube.She said: “Listening to people in the community talk about how they felt, that was how I felt. So, I decided to try it out and I have just loved it ever since. It’s just me.I understand why some people will look at the way that I am and the way that I live and be confused and think that it’s disgusting or shameful.But what people fail to see is that this is between two consenting adults and what we do in our home doesn’t really harm anyone else.The pair met while Johnny was working in a tattoo shop and Max came in to get some new artwork.Johnny said: When she came in for a tattoo she looked very nerdy and I was a gigantic nerd myself and we actually became best friends. And slowly but surely she kind of just moved her way into other aspects of my life.“When we first started dating she told me to call her princess and showed me her sippy cup.”However, the pair are adamant that DDLG is a more of a lifestyle for them and that that aspect of their relationship doesn’t transfer over into the bedroom.Max added: “To me, I am little and I use this to strengthen my relationship and to relax and have fun. For us it’s not a sexual thing, but we have no problem with people who do see in that way.And despite the unusual nature of their relationship, Max is at pains to stress that she is an adult capable of making rational decisions.She said: “I work from home, so during the day my littleness comes and goes but when I am with Johnny I am little most of the time.But I do adult stuff all the time. I am an adult. I am 20 years old, I pay my bills.“It’s not something that I can’t control. If we go out go out to a nice dinner of if we are in a grocery store or out in public, I just don’t randomly shout ‘daddy! because that’s involving other people in something that they didn’t consent to.”Max and Johnny educate others about their DDLG lifestyle on their YouTube and Instagram channels Baby Bear Max.And while Max is unsure if she’ll always be a “little”, she says she never wants to shed her childlike innocence.She said: I will always have that childlike sense of wonder about me. I will always be curious. I will always be eager to learn. I will always love Disney movies. I will always love to colour.And whether or not in 20 years I will still call myself a little, I know that I am going to have that inside me.Because I don’t want to grow up. I want to happy and carefree forever and I think that’s true of a lot of people.”Previously an adult baby who wears nappies day and night says his unusual dress-sense is about comfort NOT sex. Meanwhile a woman, 23 found fame as an ‘adult baby’ who wears a nappy as well…and her boyfriend LOVES it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My ministers have made over 30 appearances to answer questions and debate the issues. And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was at rock bottom. There were times when I thought I wouldn’t get through it.I was exhausted, fearing I would end up in jail – all for doing the right thing by the person I loved most in the world, so that she did not have to die an undignified and agonising death.”Helen was diagnosed with a lung disorder in 2004 called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency that forced her to leave her job as a college lecturer.In 2015 she made the decision to contact Dignitas and carried out all the research and payments herself.James, who was in a relationship with Helen for 33 years, said she was in a helpless situation and was in pain and suffering every day.He added: She said, ‘I’m not frightened of dying, but I am frightened about the way I die’.She had my support at every stage but said if I was uncomfortable with going she would consider going alone.We knew there could be a legal issue but there was no way I was ever going to let [her] be waved off at the door.”When the couple boarded the train to Switzerland, Helens lung capacity was at 15 per cent and she had oxygen tanks and nebulisers keeping her alive.After spending their final hours together in a hotel, the pair made their way to the clinic in Zurich where Helen was giving life ending drugs to help her pass away incredibly peacefully.But in a devastating twist of fate, the couples home in West Bromwich in the West Midlands was ransacked by thieves while Helen was ending her life in November 2016.The callous raiders stole Helen’s computer containing cherished photos and wrapped the stolen items in “the last bed sheet she slept in”.Neighbours raised the alarm and told police the couple had gone to Switzerland for Helen so she could end her life.James was then quizzed by cops within hours of arriving back in the UK without his long-term partner.He said: “Initially they were fine... The detectives said I had nothing to worry about. I told them I had a letter written by Helen outlining her decision and we had copies of all of her medical notes and letters between her GP and consultant. They just said they would be in touch.”But two months later, he was interviewed under caution and was investigated for six months until the charges were dropped in June 2017 after cops got hold of Helens medical records.James is now campaigning alongside charity Dignity in Dying to overturn the UK’s ban on assisted dying and has been in contact with Julie Smith, 48, whose husband Paul died in September 2016.The 57-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer but died in agony as his GP said he could not provide medical records for him to send to Dignitas on “ethical and legal grounds”.The disease, also known as AATD or A1AD, is a rare inherited condition that can cause liver and lung problems.Around 25,000 people in the UK have the genetic condition though most remain healthy so few have been diagnosed.Sufferers are much more vulnerable to the effects of inhaling smoke or other toxic materials like dust, fumes or chemicals.The condition increases the risk of lung disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It costs around £10,000 for a person to go to Dignitas to end their life with the sentence for assisting a suicide up to 14 years in jail.A West Midlands Police spokesman said: “The investigation was delayed because, despite West Midlands police requests for medical records, they were not made [available] until June last year.“That month, it was decided that it did not meet the evidential threshold for prosecution and the investigation was discontinued.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000277727470.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby boomers struggling pay rent maybe even more than young people","story":"Most of the baby boomer generation own homes but 1.13million rent from private landlords.The findings show that half a million baby boomers who rent privately may have had to take drastic decisions in the past year to cover their rent.A fifth of those battling to afford bills also cut down on food or heating, and one in ten have used credit.Of those who need vital changes made to their homes, such as adding handrails, stair lifts, ramps or wider doorways for wheelchairs, around two-fifths (42 per cent) have fallen over in their own home and a similar proportion at 43 per cent leave home less often then they want to.Nearly three-fifths (59 per cent) have needed these changes for over a year, the survey found.David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation,  said: We often hear that young people bear the brunt of the housing crisis but todays report reveals a shocking number of hidden baby boomers who are struggling just as much if not more.There is a huge amount of inequality amongst this age group and unfortunately the wealthier majority have hidden the reality of hundreds of thousands of people who have never been able to afford a house. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But because of what youve been through together, your love for one another will be strengthened.Little Alfie, aged 23-months, passed away in the arms of his mum and dad in the early hours of Saturday after surviving almost five days without life support.For Charlies parents Chris and Connie seeing the pain on the faces of Tom and Kate as they went through a similar experience of legal battles and bedside vigils, the couple decided to speak out.Earlier this week Chris and Connie backed calls from Alfies parents for a change to the law to give families more power over hospital care.They have now launched the campaign Charlies Law and on Sunday put out a call to action for people to write to their MP asking for support.Chris and Connie, from Bedfont, Middlesex, have also set up a foundation in their sons memory called Charlie Gard Foundation dedicated to fighting mitochondrial disease by raising awareness and funding research of the illness.In their interview, Connie said: We feel the pain of Alfies parents.

Sometimes it has been too painful to watch.And now Alfies case has made us even more determined to fight for new laws to give parents more say in what happens to their child so that other parents might be spared the agony.Baby Charlie died aged 11 months old last July just a week before his first birthday after a long fight against a disease called mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.His fight for life touched the world as Connie and Chris fought against a decision by doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital who applied for permission to have Charlies ventilator switched off.They wanted to take him to the US for pioneering treatment and took their fight all the way through the court system of the UK and Europe.Alfie was admitted to Alder Hey Childrens Hospital in Liverpool in December 2016 aged seven months. It was believed he had a mitochondrial disorder, similar to Charlie, and parents Tom, 21, and Kate, 20, experienced a similar court-battle as they fought to take their son to a hospital in Rome.Both couples lost their legal cases to take their poorly children out of the country for treatment elsewhere.Charlies Law calls for independent mediation to be offered to all parents in a similar situation to prevent cases against doctors going to court."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402475535-e1525044266341.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber rudd pm hopes dashed","story":"She was first elected as the Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye in 2010, having lived in the East Sussex constituency since 2007.Her career saw her hold ministerial positions in the Treasury and the Department of Energy and Climate Change before becoming Energy Secretary in 2015.In the run-up to the 2016 Brexit vote Ms Rudd, 54, campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU.And when Theresa May became Prime Minister after David Cameron quit following the result of the referendum, Ms Rudd succeeded her as Home Secretary.

As part of the feature a photofit was released of a man seen at the NAAFI on the day Katrice disappeared, holding a child similar to Katrice and getting into a green saloon car. We are keen to hear from anyone who could help to identify this person.A green saloon car was also seen on the River Alme Bridge near the NAAFI the day after Katrice disappeared. It may or may not be the same car, but we are very keen to identify this car.The investigation team would also like to hear from anyone who was living in the Paderborn area who owned a green saloon car in 1981, so that they can be ruled out of the teams enquiries.Officer OLeary said: Thirty six years have passed and allegiances may have changed.We are appealing to members of the public and the military community, including veterans and retired civil servants in both Germany and the UK - do you know what happened to Katrice?She had been shopping for her second birthday tea treats with her mum Sharon at the Schloss Neuhaus NAAFI supermarket when she disappeared.The case, which has chilling similarities to season two of BBC drama The Missing, remains unsolved.Sharon, now 64, said the toddler was “gone in a matter of seconds”. She added: “It’s living a nightmare that you never wake up from.“Nearly 37 years ago we became members of an exclusive club we didn’t ask for membership of — we became parents of a missing daughter. I would dearly love to be able to revoke that membership.Fighting back tears, Sharon told The Sun: “Although I would like a fairytale ending to our story, I fully appreciate that might not be.“But at the end of the day, we will have closure and any emotions that come from that closure we will learn to live with and deal with as we have for the past nearly 37 years.“The next five weeks is a double-edged sword for us as a family. We desperately want Katrice to be found but we also know that if anything is discovered during this search then my daughter’s life would have been ended in very unsavoury circumstances.“That’s another emotion we have to learn to live with.”Katrice’s dad Staff Sergeant Richard Lee, of the King’s Royal Hussars, was posted in West Germany at the height of the Cold War.On November 28, 1981, the NAAFI was rammed on the last payday before Christmas. Sharon said: “If you wanted English goodies, that was the time to get them.Katrice wouldn’t sit in the trolley, so I carried her all the way around in my arms doing my shopping.“When we got to the checkout I realised I’d forgotten crisps.“I put Katrice down and said to my sister Wendy, ‘Just keep an eye on her while I go back to the crisps stand’. It wasn’t far away. It took me about 40 seconds, a minute at most. When I got back I asked, ‘Where’s Katrice?’.“My sister said, ‘I thought she was with you. She ran and followed you’.“I went back down the aisle and she wasn’t there. Panic started to set in. I couldn’t see her anywhere. There was so many people. I was calling her name. Katrice couldn’t be found — she wasn’t there.”The Royal Military Police and German cops worked on the assumption the little girl — wearing red wellies, a turquoise duffle coat and tartan dress — wandered off, fell into another nearby river, the flooded Lippe, and drowned. But a hunt proved fruitless.Statements from shop staff were not taken for six weeks and details of an eye condition Katrice had were not released.The case was reopened in 2000 and led to the arrest of a former soldier. But he was released without charge and the case closed again after three years. There were further inquiries in 2012.Sharon, of Gosport, Hants, now divorced from Richard, is convinced Katrice was abducted. She said: “It’s my belief she left the NAAFI shop that morning, but she didn’t leave alone. I can’t believe — the NAAFI was so busy that morning — that a two-year-old walked out and disappeared off the face of the Earth and no one saw what happened.“I still have to go out and face the world and go about a daily routine but this situation never leaves you.“You can’t live with it 24/7. You have to push it to the back of your mind. But first thing in the morning and last thing at night, those are the times it gets to you.”Thanks to the family’s campaigning, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson ordered extra resources for Operation Bute — the cold case probe run by a 28-strong RMP task force.Dad Richard, now 68, had criticised the RMP handling of the case, but felt his voice had “finally been heard” at a summit with Mr Williamson this year. He said: “Hopefully, we can resolve issues and find out where my daughter is.”As cops appeal again for information to help solve the case, Sharon added: “If people put themselves in my shoes for five minutes and feel how we have lived and felt for the past 36 years, then maybe those feelings would get them to come forward.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The previous record-holder was Garett McNamara who surfed a 78ft wave in 2011.Brit surfer Andrew Cotton won the Wipeout of the Year award at the ceremony for a horrifying fall in Portugal also in November 2017.He couldn’t attend the ceremony as he was still recovering from the broken back he suffered during the accident.Koxa told surfing publication Surfline that he had a dream the night before the competition that inspired him to tackle the wave. He said: “I had an amazing dream the night before, where I was talking to myself, ‘You gotta go straight down’. I didn’t really know what it meant.Koxa said that when he was riding the wave he turned and almost fell, then he remembered “go straight down” from his dream.He said: “I got my feet again and went super fast. I’ve never had a big wave like that… I just went straight down. It was amazing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hilarious moment paddle boarder is taken out by a playful dolphin in australia","story":"Footage shows the man named Andrew paddling off the coast of Western Australia, when a pod of dolphins sped towards him.One of the aquatic mammals is seen leaping out of the water and catching the 54-year-old on the back.Andrew is sent flying into the water as the dolphin swims away, before finally climbing back onto his board.One of them for some reason decided to jump out of the water and took me out quite well, he told 7 News Sydney.He added: It was a fairly legal hit in the shoulder I think...

We’ve never, ever held the City of Westminster. We last held Wandsworth in 1978.“If we took those it would be a spectacular night.” Tories chairman Brandon Lewis yesterday tried to turn election debate into a referendum on largely Labour-run councils’ performances rather than a protest vote against Theresa May’s government.Mr Lewis also told the Andrew Marr Show: “It was interesting to see Andrew row back from turning the whole country red.“It’s people’s frustrations locally that matter.”But senior Tory MP Ed Vaizey admitted the Windrush scandal will have damaged the Tories’ chances at the ballot box. This comes as Home Secretary Amber Rudd resigns.Mr Vaizey told ITV1’s Peston on Sunday: “We’ll have to work three times harder to win back ethnic minority voters I think”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
