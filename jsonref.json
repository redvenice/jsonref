Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A question from a sample paper of the higher level Leaving Cert Mandarin Chinese exam. Niamh McNally is a Mandarin Chinese teacher:  “The Leaving Cert course is designed so that when you enter fifth year, if you have no language background, you are well capable of taking the course in two years and achieving a good grade.” Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Sanda Sanduta and Carla Quinlan with teacher Niamh McNally: “I’m very glad I’ve chosen to study it for the Leaving,” says Sanduta. “I’m excited to be one of the first students to sit the new exam,” adds Quinlan. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw When asked what motivated them to study Chinese for the Leaving Cert, students at Our Lady’s Grove Secondary School in Dublin’s Clonskeagh give varied answers.“It’s just so different,” says sixth year Carla Quinlan. “I wouldn’t consider myself the best at languages, but I’m loving Chinese. I love the foundation of the characters, when you see one matches up with the other . . . ”For Sanda Sanduta, also a sixth-year student, it has been about getting a window into Chinese culture.“I was watching Chinese TV shows and dramas, even before I started to learn Chinese, ” she says . “I just had never had the opportunity until I came to school it’s one of the reasons I chose to come here.”As for principal Colm Dooley, the decision to offer the subject made sense for many reasons.“There are great opportunities for the girls. China is a huge training partner. And it’s going to be for their generation we’re educating for tomorrow, not for today,” he says. “We’re a State school surrounded by private schools and affluence here is something which we feel is niche and will give them another feather in their cap.”Students at Our Lady’s Grove are among an estimated 100 nationally due to sit the first ever Mandarin Chinese exam on the Leaving Cert curriculum this summer.Like traditional foreign languages on the curriculum such as French and German, there will be oral and aural elements, along with a written exam at higher and ordinary level.Unlike other languages, however, it is aimed at students with no prior knowledge of Chinese. Yet, on the face of it, the sample paper – which requires candidates to read and write using Chinese script – looks fiendishly difficult.Prior knowledgeStudents point out that the language has relatively simple grammar. For example, there is no verb conjugation (so, no need to memorise verb tenses ) or gender and number distinctions. In theory, a student taking up the subject in fifth year should be able to complete the exam and get a good grade.The availability of Chinese on the Leaving Cert is part of a wider strategy launched several years ago under then minister for education Richard Bruton to expand the choice of foreign languages in schools at a time when trade links are growing in emerging countries.While Chinese is the most eye-catching new addition to the Leaving Cert, students this year will also be sitting the first exams in Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese as curricular languages – three languages that, due to immigration, are now widely spoken in Ireland (indeed, Polish is more widely spoken in Ireland than Irish).It is estimated that about 1,500 students will sit exams in these new language exams this summer.But is it a fad or the future?After all, there is a small pool of teachers able to teach Chinese and other minority languages.Some also wonder whether the rise of Chinese language learning is too closely linked to its economic success – with the risk that it could fade if growth in China were to flag.Karen Ruddock, director of Post Primary Languages Ireland, says there is potential to grow the numbers studying foreign languages for the Leaving Cert.Her organisation is helping to make teachers available to schools – in person or remotely – and facilitating access to weekend classes if languages are not available locally.More generally, she says the global dominance of English has given rise to the mistaken belief that “English is enough”.This, she said, can result in complacency and a lack of motivation to learn other languages.Teacher shortage“Learning a foreign language will create more work opportunities, more chances to make friends and have great life experiences,” she said.A major obstacle, however, is teacher supply. Even among the most common foreign languages such as French and German, there is a shortage of qualified teachers.The Chinese government in recent years has stepped up the activities of the Confucius Institutes – a network of cultural diplomacy bodies tasked with increasing China’s “soft power” around the globe – to help boost teacher supply.The government funds visiting teachers in about 10 schools in Ireland and has subsidised cultural trips to China.While Confucius Institutes are often likened to the Alliance Française, critics say they are aggressive in pushing Beijing’s world view and shutting down discussion of any topics regarded as politically sensitive such as China’s human rights record.Indeed, links with the Chinese government in the rollout of the new Leaving Cert course have been at the centre of controversyLast year, it emerged that an adviser paid by the Chinese government is to have an “oversight” role in the subject as part of an agreement between the Department of Education and its counterpart in Beijing.Ruddock, however, says the adviser will have “zero oversight” in the design of the curriculum their role will be limited to supporting teachers with continuous professional development or initial teacher education.“This is happening very much under our direction we have oversight and have our own Chinese language adviser... it is literally a supporting role. If we’re offered additional expertise at no cost, we’ll say yes – but it’s very much under our direction . . . The idea that somehow the Chinese government will come and do whatever they like is nonsense.”The department’s decision to use only a simplified script in the new Leaving Cert exam in Mandarin Chinese has also sparked anger among some campaigners.Traditional or heritage Chinese script is used by most people from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other mostly non-mainland-China locations.Ruddock says this approach was agreed following an extensive consultation process with the education sector.Our Lady’s Grove has had visiting Chinese teachers in the past, but it recently hired Irish teacher Niamh McNally – a “brilliant addition”, says principal Colm Dooley.There can sometimes be cultural barriers in teaching methods with visiting teachers, he says, with a bigger emphasis in China on teachers being a “sage on the stage” compared to the more student-focused approach in Irish schools.

Coveney’s involvement seems to have been limited to a brief speech. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill There is a mixture of bemusement and fear in the Government about the controversy over the champagne quaffing at the Department of Foreign Affairs shortly after Ireland won a seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020.Bemusement that the issue has reignited a year and a half after it was first apologised for and fear that controversy is escalating – Downing Street-style – into a major political mess.The story seems certain to run for some time yet. The Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee will discuss on Tuesday whether to request (another) attendance by Simon Coveney to answer questions about the conduct of his department and his own decisions.One doesn’t need a long memory to recall Coveney’s appearances at the committee a few months ago to discuss his abandoned appointment of Katherine Zappone. A repeat is unlikely to be a prospect that the Minister for Foreign Affairs greets with any relish. After an ill-judged first appearance, he returned for a more conspicuously contrite second stint at the committee a week later. It was a deeply damaging episode for him.Damage causedThe memory of that controversy and the damage it inflicted on the wider Government at the time is still fresh and is causing colleagues and others to wonder if Coveney hasn’t become rather too accident-prone. With a reshuffle of Fine Gael Ministers already advertised for the end of the year, there is no shortage of rivals and frenemies willing to discuss this issue. Whatever about that, Coveney’s refusal to answer any questions about the department drinks over a period of weeks now seems to many people to have been a mistake.The department itself is by turns mortified at the blunder – and irritated that so much is now being made of what most officials honestly believe to be a venial sin. Of course, there are others who are annoyed that the department was effectively dobbed in by its former secretary general, Niall Burgess, whose posting of a photo of the event (hastily deleted a few hours later) now looks like a classic social media gaffe. Burgess has since been posted as Ambassador to Paris, not exactly a hardship post. His successor, Joe Hackett, is compiling a report for Coveney.Downing Street comparisonIn such febrile political times, these controversies can take unpredictable trajectories. But it would be hard to seriously place them in the same category as the Downing Street high jinks. Colleagues who were working closely together shared a few bottles of champagne (or worse, prosecco, according to one person). Nobody organised a party nobody danced the night away. Coveney’s involvement seems to have been limited to a brief speech.It seems fair to conclude that the re-emergence of the controversy owes more to the comparisons with Downing Street than it does to its inherent seriousness."},{"url":null,"title":"northeast nigeria s students brave kidnappings poverty to go to school","story":"Usman, Danec, Hadiza and Ummate, students at Moduganari Primary and Secondary School in Maiduguri, northeast Nigeria. Photograph:  Sally HaydenHead teacher Sani Garba Mohammed stands in front of a blackboard reading “R data processing” in the El Ansar Islamiya school in Maiduguri, northeast Nigeria. These are notes from a computer class, he explains, even though his school of more than 400 students has no computers. “We learn theory,” Mohammed laughs.He has bigger problems to deal with. The school charges fees of 4,000 naira (€8.46) a term but he estimates that only 30 per cent of students pay it. Teachers in Nigeria get “respect but no money” and purchasing basic supplies for the school is a struggle, he says.But he counts his blessings too, among them the fact that – though there are still sporadic attacks close by by Islamist militant group Boko Haram – the security situation has improved inside his city’s limits and he feels less of a target than teachers would have in the past.Northeast Nigeria is likely one of the most dangerous places in the world to attend school, and still teachers lead lessons and the students come. More than one million students have been forced out of education in the region during a 13-year-old insurgency that has displaced millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people, including more than 2,200 teachers, according to the UN children’s agency, Unicef.At least 802 schools have been closed by the conflict, with 497 classrooms listed as destroyed and another 1,392 damaged. Some schools have been turned into camps for displaced people.Compounding this trauma, in recent years school kidnappings have become much more common.The abduction of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram – whose name roughly translates as “Western Education is Forbidden” – from the northeast town of Chibok in April 2014 by the insurgent group sparked an online social media campaign, #BringBackOurGirls, which received worldwide attention.RansomsOver the following years, the Nigerian government swapped prisoners and paid millions of dollars to secure the release of some of the girls – though more 100 of the abductees are now dead or still held by the militant group.Kidnappings have long targeted relatives of the wealthy or famous in Nigeria, but in the years since the Chibok abductions, school kidnappings have become a lucrative business, with the perpetrators – ranging from insurgents to bandits – demanding ransoms of hundreds of thousands of euro, even when kidnapping poor children.A report carried out by SBM Intelligence, a Nigerian intelligence platform, said that at least $18 million was paid to Nigerian kidnappers between June 2011 and March 2020.A $30 million Safe Schools Initiative, spearheaded after the Chibok kidnappings by former British prime minister Gordon Brown and supported by the UK’s Department for International Development, UN agencies, private business leaders and the Nigerian government, saw promises to protect 500 schools in the northeast, but last year the BBC revealed that almost nothing had come from it.By November last year, UNICEFnicef said there had been at least 1,440 students abducted in Nigeria and 25 attacks on schools in 2021 alone. In northeast Nigeria specifically, UNICEFnicef said thousands of children in the regionhad been killed, maimed, abducted, displaced, and experienced multiple violations of their human rights because of the ongoing conflict.“Nigerian children – whether they are the direct targets of violence or collateral victims of conflict – are caught up in the ongoing insecurity we are seeing across the country. This is unacceptable,” said Phuong T Nguyen, the head of Unicef’’s Maiduguri field office.Added to these threats are issues related to poverty, a lack of support, the need to find food and other obstacles which mean that only around half of children in northern Nigeria attend school, according to UNICEFnicef.The school is unable provide enough drinking water to students, she adds. Some of the students are from families displaced by the conflict, or orphans taken in by relatives, and they turn up hungry or not properly clothed. But they clearly want to learn.The school was closed for seven months at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, during which time most students did not have access to TVs or radios for remote learning, but now they’re catching up, she says. Some now receive free uniforms, notebooks and pencils from organisations such as Plan International and Unicef.In one of the classrooms, students speak about their experiences.“They’ve giving us knowledge and things we should know for the future,” says Hyeladzira Balami (13), whose favourite class is English. “I want to be a lawyer. To decide what’s right and wrong and cast judgement on corruption. The leaders we have are corrupt, if they are found doing something they pay money and get away but I wouldn’t be corrupt, I’d pass fair judgement.”Maryam Ali, a 16-year-old with seven siblings, wants to be a doctor to help the sick. “I like school because I’m learning,” she says. “If I didn’t learn I’d be dull and dirty.”“Because of our circumstances people want access to education, they want to get knowledge,” she says, when asked why so many young people here seem to prioritise schooling. “A lack of education can push people into lots of things including insurgency, drug addiction, prostitution.”Assistant head boy Mikail Abubakar (14), moved to the area six years ago, after his family fled conflict 70km away in Bama. He dreams of studying physics, joining the navy and travelling to Dubai. “I have seen pictures on the internet, it is very beautiful.”In his class just three could afford to buy textbooks, and they keep them to themselves, he says. When Abubakar goes home, his older brother assists him with homework. His parents sewed his uniform.HungerIn government schools, overcrowding can be extreme. More than 18,000 students are enrolled in the Moduganari Primary and Secondary government schools in Maiduguri, according to teachers – and they share one premises. There are plumbing issues and just 12 toilets. Many students show up hungry, begging for food from others in their classes.Only about 20 percent of parents can afford to buy educational supplies for their children others are provided by charities. “Some children come from vulnerable families and they don’t have food to eat, the parents go begging to find something to eat, they don’t bring food to school,” she says. Other children leave school to go straight to work at jobs like carpentry, welding, or repairing generators. In the afternoon, more young people, who have dropped out of the formal school system, come by to do classes.One of those working is Usman, a 14-year-old who saYS he loves reading, writing and learning about the best ways to cultivate crops and rear animals. After school each day he roams the streets looking for people who need their shoes repaired. He uses the money to buy uniforms and books for his younger siblings.Danec Andrew (13) says her favourite subject is science, but she says it’s hard to study when her classroom doesn’t have enough desks for them to sit at.Because of the lack of teachers, students are recruited as prefects to try to get others to behave. Hadiza Ibrahim (14) says it can be “stressful” ordering around other students as “the children are so many”. Some of the prefects have sticks with rope hanging off them. “When you use the cane they listen,” says Ibrahim.Teachers in the schools are paid 13,000-15,000 naira (€27 to €32) a month by the government. Plan International also gives some untrained teachers a stipend.One of these charity-funded – or “volunteer” – teachers, Falmata Abdulkadir Alkali, invites us to imagine teaching a group of 189 five-year-olds writing, maths or English. The lack of running water and sanitation means that disease and illness can spread quickly, and there are other interruptions too. “The students that are hungry disturb the other students,” she says.“Some are coming barefooted, without sandals, their uniforms have tears,” says Rifkatu Jacop, another so-called “volunteer” teacher. “Sometimes you pity them and give them money to buy food.”“You cannot mark their books, there are too many,” says Dunya Mgwamdai, who posited that reducing the numbers in a classroom to “just” 50 students would make things a lot more manageable. “They would hear you, they would co-operate with you.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress

the floorboards of a classroom has confirmed a local legend previously dismissed by staff and pupils for generations.Since the 1920s, local rumours have abounded of a First World War soldier bringing back the corpse of a saltwater crocodile to the primary school of Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Bodringallt in South Wales.The desiccated reptile was reputedly put on display in a case before staff hid it during the interwar years to protect it from future damage. Its existence remained an “old myth” for decades before builders carrying out renovation work stumbled across its carcass in 2019.After two years of painstaking research by the Welsh heritage company Pure Conservation, the crocodile remains are on display once more.Conservator Dr Victoria Purewal and artist Annette Marie Townsend, who specialises in Natural History, had slowly cleaned the bones and restored the loose teeth of the five-foot long reptile.The team scraped off the thick layer of ingrained dirt and cobwebs on the beast’s body and meticulously arranged its loose and damaged scales.A supporting mould was used to define the overall shape as its whole underside was missing along with its feet and the base of its tail.Conservationists had finished their work just before last Christmas and placed the restored reptile on display with a box of various bones and loose materials.Although there was no accompanying information with the crocodile, which had suffered significant damage after being left unprotected for more than a century, experts believe it dates back to before the 1900s, making it at least 120 years old.Dr Neil Pike, the headmaster of the school, had said at the time of its discovery: “I’d heard a story that parents and school staff had buried a crocodile under the school some time between the two world wars.“I thought it was an old myth and I didn’t take much notice until Thursday morning when I went to check the building work at the school.“Laid on the floor of the hall was the crocodile.”Councillor Joy Rosser, Rhondda Cynon Taf Council’s Cabinet Member for Education and Inclusion Services, commented: “The story of the crocodile at Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Bodringallt is absolutely incredible - it was the last thing workmen thought they’d find underneath a classroom.“I’m delighted its conservation is now complete, and that the legendary crocodile which was rumoured to have been associated with the school is now proudly on display.“I’d like to thank Pure Conservation for their dedicated work in restoring the crocodile, and for making it safe for the school to keep.“Their thorough analysis dates the crocodile back to the 19th Century - and its condition when discovered in 2019 is consistent with it being potentially untouched for up to a century.“I’d like to thank Doctor Victoria Purewal and Annette Marie Townsend for their dedication and close working with the Council.”More from NewsTougher powers for magistrates to jail criminals and clear courts

But it is also notable for another reason. The Lee case represents a crucial shift in the UK’s China strategy, from denial to acceptance.This is the first time that the Government has mentioned the United Front Work Department (UFWD) being active in the UK, yet for those who have followed China closely, the tawdry details of the Lee case contain few surprises. There is plenty of evidence for how China targets businesses and politicians, or how CCP-affiliated iniduals position themselves as voices of diaspora communities across British society, whether in politics or in local community schools. What is far more interesting is the shift in the UK’s approach. Why issue a warning now? Even though Lee’s involvement in British politics has been on the radar for at least five years, British security services have previously been apprehensive about publicly linking Beijing to state activities in the UK.Take the case last year, where it was reported that at least 10,000 British citizens, including staff in virtually every government department, had been targeted by agents posing as LinkedIn recruiters. Despite intelligence agencies being confident that almost all approaches were carried out on behalf of the Chinese state, MI5’s official warning made no specific mention of China.At last, things are changing. We now recognise the value of publicly naming those trying to harm our interests. The warning shot from MI5 last week comes hot on the heels of MI6 chief Richard Moore identifying China as the agency’s “single greatest priority” for the first time in its history. And for the first time, the UK joined its allies in naming Chinese state-sponsored hackers as responsible for the attack on the Microsoft Exchange Servers, which the National Cyber Security Centre called one of the most serious cyber intrusions ever observed. The UK’s new Cyber Strategy is unambiguous. It concludes that ‘how China evolves in the next decade will probably be the biggest single driver of the UK’s future cyber security’.Public acknowledgement of China’s influence on the UK is an important step in the right direction. For those who follow China closely, this represents a much-needed closing of the gap between what we know about China, and change in British policy.When it comes to CCP interference, we are inching towards progress. The solution to the problem — in the form of the UK’s new laws to counter state threats — may still be yet to arrive. But we now have a better public understanding of how Beijing has professionalised and streamlined its UFWD work under Xi Jinping, and what that means for Britain.If we are improving our understanding of CCP interference, we now need to close that gap in other areas. Beijing increasingly relishes blurring the line between the state and society, which means we need to reassess many things which looked fine five years ago. This is wide-ranging. We need to look at the strict new laws that Beijing is enforcing on the use of data in China and ask what that means for tech companies like TikTok. We need to look at the rise of China’s digital yuan and work out what that means for the City, and whether we should move faster on plans for a digital pound. And we need to look at Beijing’s increasing control of global shipping networks and ask if Britain should pay more attention to how our goods flow through our ports.Acknowledging that UFWD targets Britain is a key moment. It makes it easier to discuss how China challenges our interests. It is an essential step on the road to a better China strategy.Julia Pamilih is Director of Research at the China Research GroupMore from NewsTougher powers for magistrates to jail criminals and clear courts backlogIt’s time to empower magistrates to clear the backlog in our courtsJulian Fellowes: Writers must stop portraying black people as victimsTexas synagogue terrorist was able to enter US from Britain despite ‘series of red flags’Man charged with manslaughter after death of British girl, 5, in French AlpsIs that mew?

The Treasury has made it clear that new taxes will be necessary in coming years to replace the loss of fuel duty but the Government has so far shied away from introducing road pricing as an alternative.The City Hall report stressed that the technology to charge drivers per mile is “still years away from being ready”, so the Mayor is considering several alternatives which “could be ready within the next few years”.“One approach is for the Ulez to be extended beyond the North and South Circular Roads to cover the whole of London.”Existing charge levels and emissions standards could be maintained, the report said, or a small fee could be charged for all but the cleanest vehicles.Nicholas Lyes, the head of roads policy at RAC, said that the measures would be especially punitive to drivers who cannot afford to purchase an electric vehicle at a time when the cost of living is soaring.“We all want to see cleaner air and cleaner vehicles on the road and it’s right the Mayor has ambitions to reduce emissions from road transport but these proposals could be beyond the means of many and will punish those who simply cannot afford an electric car,” he said.“Worse still, proposals to charge vehicles outside of London to enter the boundary is likely to impact hardest on workers such as carers, tradespeople and night-time economy staff for whom there is no alternative to using a vehicle.”The mayor commissioned Element Energy, a consultancy, to set out scenarios for cutting London’s carbon emissions to zero overall.The most ambitious proposals require £75 billion in infrastructure investment between now and 2030 and the taxpayer will have to foot a large part of the bill. Mr Khan said that the proposals will require central government funding.His concerns were echoed by Edmund King, the president of the AA, who said “charging vehicles off the road” was not the solution to cutting pollution, adding: “We need to encourage the uptake of cleaner, greener vehicles.”More from NewsTougher powers for magistrates to jail criminals and clear courts backlogIt’s time to empower magistrates to clear the backlog in our courtsJulian Fellowes: Writers must stop portraying black people as victimsTexas synagogue terrorist was able to enter US from Britain despite ‘series of red flags’Man charged with manslaughter after death of British girl, 5, in French AlpsIs that mew?

Who can be in your bubble? How many people can you meet outside? Can we meet anyone socially indoors? It didn’t help that the rules tended to change from week to week. A short attention  was as likely as any philosophical stand against mask-wearing to land you with a fine.So perhaps people will be indulgent towards Sir Keir Starmer, who was pictured having drinks with staff in a Labour MP’s constituency office, at a time when indoor socialising was banned. Unlike the Prime Minister, he was not responsible for drafting the rules that he is accused of breaking. The reported behaviour was not on the same scale as that alleged in Downing Street. There is no evidence of wine trips to a supermarket near Labour HQ, or of parties on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral.Still, in failing to apologise for the incident – and claiming that “we did nothing wrong” – Starmer has stumbled badly. Perhaps he was not in breach of the rules as they stood at the time – that, despite the beer in his hand, he and his colleagues had indeed stopped briefly to eat before carrying on working (indoor mixing was allowed for work reasons). But because of the perfectly self-righteous attitude Labour has adopted towards any and all breaking of the rules, the incident leaves him open to that most damaging of accusations: hypocrisy.In his response to Partygate, Starmer, ably assisted by his new front bench, has been responsible for framing a narrative that will accept no possibility of bending, let alone breaking, the rules. If Labour hadn’t pushed the “one rule for them, another for the rest of us” line so vociferously in the context of No 10, maybe it would be easier to accept the notion that the allegations levelled against him should be dismissed out of hand.Moreover, Labour has put itself firmly on the side of those who have argued that lockdown wasn’t merely a necessary evil, but morally right and impossible to question. In order to highlight the PM’s alleged perfidy, for instance, the party has broadcast examples of sacrifices made by ordinary citizens. The most egregious was a statement by an NHS nurse called Jenny, who boasted that she had refused a desperate husband access to his dying wife. “He begged, wept, shouted to be let in, but we said no… She died unexpectedly and alone.”Labour shared this on social media as condemnation of Johnson, too disconnected from the reality of ordinary people’s lives to understand that it was actually a condemnation of jobsworth health workers. Still Starmer refused to call for a relaxation of the restrictions that had allowed too many to wield unjust power over the lives of vulnerable people. And when it came to an evening inside a colleague’s constituency office, he had a drink and a laugh. He must be grateful that Nurse Jenny wasn’t nearby.Starmer doesn’t need to resign, but he does need to apologise. If he’s going to trade on his public prosecutor reputation, he should admit that there exists an element of reasonable doubt about what was going on that evening.

However, that is a 42 per cent decline since the previous Monday. If the current trajectory continues, Britain will hit around 50,000 cases by the middle of the week – the same level as when Boris Johnson announced restrictions on Dec 8.The number of tests coming back positive has also started to fall, from a high of 32.3 per cent on Jan 4 to 26 per cent on Jan 11, showing that it is a true decline rather than a lack of testing capacity as some have claimed. The Office for National Statistics infection survey is also showing falls in recent days.Data show the number of people requiring mechanical ventilation had dropped to 746 as of Jan 13 – the lowest it has been since Nov 10. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in Britain has declined to 19,345 after peaking at 19,906 on Jan 10. The figures show that 44 per cent of people in hospital in England are incidental cases, having been admitted for a different reason and tested positive on arrival or shortly afterwards. There are also signs that admissions are levelling off.England’s “Plan B” restrictions are due to expire on Jan 26, and ministers hope they will not need to be renewed.Prof Mike Tildesley, of the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (SPI-M), said case figures were “cautiously good news” and he hoped the country may have a “flu-type” relationship with Covid by next winter.He told BBC Breakfast that “it does look like, across the whole of the country, cases seem to be falling”, adding: “We have had very, very high case numbers throughout late December and early January – we peaked at about 200,000 at one point.“We do now seem to be a little bit beyond that. Hospital admissions are still relatively high, albeit there is some evidence that maybe they’re plateauing or possibly going down in London, which is cautiously good news.“I would say we probably need about an extra week of data to really see the effect of children going back to school – we’re still only two weeks since children went back to school – but if we still see that over the next week or so, I’d be pretty confident that we are seeing this wave turning around.”Downing Street said there were “encouraging signs”, with the Prime Minister’s official spokesman saying the “maximum amount of time possible” would be given to prepare for any changes in the rules.“In terms of the data, there are some encouraging signs that infections are falling across the country, the spokesman said. “There are also some signs of falls – or at least plateauing – in admissions and occupancy in hospital, which is good to see.“But it still remains the case that our NHS is under significant pressure – there are over 16,000 Covid patients in hospital in England alone. So we are keeping a very close eye on the data but we do believe the mitigations we have in place – particularly our booster programme – are offering massive protection to the public.”Dr David Nabarro, a World Health Organisation special envoy for Covid, told Sky News there was “light at the end of the tunnel” for the UK.More from NewsTougher powers for magistrates to jail criminals and clear courts backlogIt’s time to empower magistrates to clear the backlog in our courtsJulian Fellowes: Writers must stop portraying black people as victimsTexas synagogue terrorist was able to enter US from Britain despite ‘series of red flags’Man charged with manslaughter after death of British girl, 5, in French AlpsIs that mew?

Almost  Tory MPs opposed his plans to make people show Covid passes - proof of a vaccine or negative test - in nightclubs and big events. Rebel Tim Loughton said: “We do not want a society where we ask for papers and deprive people of their liberty.”Another Tory, Marcus Fysh, declared: “We are not a ‘papers please’ society. This is not Nazi Germany, okay ”But tonight, most of those same Tory MPs voted en masse to force voters to show ID at polling stations in future to crack down on fraud.  The Elections Bill passed its final hurdle, despite being dubbed an “assault on democracy” and a “sledgehammer to crack a nut” by critics. Of the  Tory MPs who opposed Covid passes last month,  voted to keep the Voter ID measures. Just two Tory MPs, David Davis and William Wragg, voted against forcing voters to show ID at polling stations.The  MPs’ supporters, of course, will point out the same argument works in reverse for Labour - as the party has largely been supporting Covid passes but opposing voter ID checks.They will also stress you can’t make a direct comparison between forcing someone to disclose health status and anti-fraud checks.  But Kyle Taylor, director of Fair Vote UK, said: “They either don’t care about democracy or they are demonstrating breathtaking hypocrisy.” So who were the  Tory MPs who didn’t want people showing their papers to get into a nightclub, but did want them for a polling station  Here’s a full run-down. The list, for clarity, is of Tory MPs who opposed Covid passes, then also opposed an amendment to the Elections Bill that would have ditched voter ID checks, according to Parliamentaposs official ision lists.Adam Afriyie Lee Anderson Shaun Bailey Siobhan Baillie Steve Baker Harriett Baldwin Scott Benton Bob Blackman Peter Bone Ben Bradley Karen Bradley Graham Brady Andrew Bridgen Steve Brine Miriam Cates Brendan Clarke-Smith Geoffrey Clton-Brown Tracey Crouch Philip Davies Dehenna Davison Jonathan Djanogly Richard Drax Iain Duncan Smith Tobias Ellwood Luke Evans Louie French Richard Fuller Marcus Fysh Nusrat Ghani Jo Gideon Chris Grayling Chris Green Damian Green James Grundy Stephen Hammond Mark Harper Adam Holloway Tom Hunt Mark Jenkinson David Jones Simon Jupp Alicia Kearns Julian Knight Greg Knight Robert Largan Pauline Latham Andrea Leadsom Andrew Lewer Julian Lewis Chris Loder Jonathan Lord Tim Loughton Craig Mackinlay Anthony Mangnall Karl McCartney Stephen McPartland Esther McVey Stephen Metcalfe Damien Moore Robbie Moore Robert Neill Matthew Offord Mark Pawsey Mike Penning John Penrose Andrew Percy Tom Randall John Redwood Laurence Robertson Gary Sambrook Bob Seely Greg Smith Henry Smith Ben Spencer Jane Stevenson John Stevenson Julian Sturdy Desmond Swayne Derek Thomas Craig Tracey Tom Tugendhat Theresa Villiers Christian Wakeford David Warburton Giles WatlingRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Desmond SwayneTobias EllwoodEsther McVeyBen SpencerRobert NeillShaun BaileyBob BlackmanRobbie MooreLee AndersonDerek ThomasJohn StevensonHenry SmithSteve BakerChris GreenAndrea LeadsomAdam AfriyieJonathan DjanoglyChris GraylingTheresa VilliersMike PenningKyle TaylorPeter BoneJohn RedwoodDamian GreenAdam HollowayGraham BradyPhilip DaviesLaurence RobertsonJulian LewisGreg KnightStephen HammondTim LoughtonMark HarperGeoffrey Clton-BrownIain Duncan SmithBoris JohnsonDavid DavisGreg SmithConservative PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper urged the Government to work with France and other countries to tackle criminal gangs and ensure safe passages for migrants. Fresh reports claim No  officials explored using Long-Range Acoustic Devicesas sound grenades on migrants in the English Channel There are two LRADaposs already installed on two Border Force vessels, but are only used for voice commands.The Ministry of Defence purchased the mighty devices for use as loud speakers during the  Olympic Games in London. A Home Office source told The Sun the suggestion was “f***ing bonkers. The LRADaposs can cause vomiting, mild traumatic brain injuries and permanent hearing loss. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: No.  seems to have lost any sense of respect or humanitythey can stoop this low for the sake of headlines. Targeting sonic weapons at people in small boats will not stop criminal gangs from profiting, it will just put more lives at risk. The Home Office is right to reject it. “This is a serious issue which requires serious solutions - not more headline-chasing.”It comes as Boris Johnson is accused of trying to distract attention from the Downing Street Partygate scandal.Earlier today, Priti Patel confirmed warships will be sent into the Channel to police small boats.  Home Secretary Priti Patel insisted: “This Government considers all options in terms of outsourcing, processing and how we actually remove as well people with no legal basis to be in our country.” The Navy is to take over command of the operation to stop Channel crossings from the Border Force within weeks. At least , migrants successfully made the voyage last year - trebling the total from . But  people were killed two months ago when their inflatable dinghy sank off Calais.  At the end of last year, Ms Patel told a Commons committee it is simply not right for people to arrive in the UK with all their correct documents, and then claim asylum. The Home Secretary suggested genuine seekers fleeing dangerous situations would arrive on Britainaposs shores without anything to hand. But those who arrive without any documents would have access to temporary permission to stay in the UK, a committee heard. At the time, a Home Office spokesperson told the Mirror: If someone has travelled via a safe country like France, then their claim may be considered ‘inadmissible’ and they could be removed from the UK.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Home OfficeMinistry of DefencePriti PatelBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Usually these drinking sessions are sandwiched between pieces of work, so it feels like a very, very routine thing, Ms Khan told BBC Radio aposs World At One programme.Drinks could start at lunch time, they could start a little bit later in the day - dferent teams do things very dferently - but the idea of mini fridges or having drinks underneath your table wasnapost uncommon. Ms Khan said senior people at No  going back two decades had used drinks as a way of thanking staff for working very, very long hours. Askedpeople had been so hungover they had slept on sofas in Downing Street, she said: I did see a few instances of that - people waking up in the same clothes the next day. But obviously I didnapost work during a pandemic and it didnapost happen very often back then, I should say. I canapost speak for what itaposs like now. Mr Johnson was forced to apologise after it emerged his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, invited more than  members of staff to a bring your own booze party in the No  garden in May  during the first lockdown. The Prime Minister admitted he attended but argued he believed it was a work event that could technically have been within the rules. Ms Khan said: Drinks in No  ... feel like such a normalised thing so it doesnapost feel like anything out of the ordinary. Now in a pandemic thataposs totally dferent and you can absolutely say that people shouldaposve had the oversight, given that they are all so smart and intelligent. Ms Khan worked as a civil servant in No  under Mr Cameron, before working in the Treasury as a special adviser during Mrs Mayaposs leadership.She briefly remained in the Treasury after Mr Johnson took over, but was marched out of Downing Street by armed police after being sacked by Dominic Cummings in August  over allegations of leaking. She later settled a claim against the Government for unfair dismissal.Over the weekend, Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said there are plans to address the kind of culture that has allowed alleged rule breaches.This will include a crackdown on drinking in Downing Street, The Sunday Times reported. On Monday, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said Mr Johnson will set out his changes after senior civil servant Sue Gray publishes her inquiry into allegations of partying. He told reporters: I think Iaposd point back to what the Prime Ministeraposs talked about, that thereaposs a shared recognition that No  should be held to the highest standard. There are things clearly we didnapost get right and we need to take responsibility for those. But beyond that, I think itaposs right to let the report be published and then youaposll hear more from the Prime Minister.

As the Home Secretary insisted the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill will stop people apospreventing children from getting to school, and ambulances getting to hospitalapos, activists held signs which read, aposKILL THE BILLapos. The Home Secretary seemed un-phased as the signs began to flood the Zoom screen. She was speaking to a group of young Tory activists remotely last week, and joined by Tory MP for Carshalton and Wallington Elliot Colburn. The pair were holding a QA session for young blue campaigners wishing to learn more about up and coming Conservative policies. But Mr Colburn became increasingly agitated as the call went on - saying: I have no idea how these lefties got into the call.  After Ms Patelaposs y opening speech he opened the call for questions - but the questions were more than the two MPs bargained for. A member of the Green New Deal Rising group made a surprise appearance in the QA session, asking why Ms Patel was pushing this bill - which will jail some protesters for six months - through Parliament. She said: We have freedoms in our country and weaposre very, very proud of our freedoms. But actually, we are changing our laws... to stop disruption to our way of le and disruption to our economic way of le as well. And certainly in the two years where Iaposve been home secretary, weaposve had the streets of London, weaposve had streets of other cities, that have been brought to a grinding halt. Weaposve seen children not being able to get to school. Weaposve seen people stranded in ambulances when they desperately needed to get to hospital. That is why we are bringing our laws in. Everyone has the right to protest and the freedom to protest that is the right of our democracy in our open society. But alongside that, there are legal ways of doing that and right and proper ways of doing that and causing the type of harm and disruption that we have seen has been very, very counterproductive, I feel as well, and the police will talk about this very vocally, in terms of police resourcing the cost of them when they could actually be spending their time protecting our streets and protecting the vulnerable people that actually need help and support.  But as the QA was coming to an end and hundreds in the call werenapost able to get their questions in, campaigners flooded the Zoom chat and screen.A source from the group told the Mirror: They zoom bombed Priti Patel to make it clear to her the kinds of things we want introduced in the bill.We want to be able to raise our voices - thataposs part of a ing democratic society. One campaigner questioned: Why did you put me in prison for drumming at a protest  Another asked: Would you have arrested the suffragettes for being too disruptive  And seconds later, the chat was flooded with the slogan aposKILL THE BILLapos. Nervous Mr Colburn wrote in the chat: Apologies to those of you who genuinely came here to ask questions. I have no idea how these lefties got into the call. I will be asking CCHQ to review how they monitor who is let into these calls.A Home Office source told the Mirror: Itaposs not going to rank very highly on the list of UK protests. She would have happily spent the entire session answering questions and explaining why we are doing what we are doing. It comes after protesters took to the streets across the UK to decry the police and crime bill which is reaching its final stages in parliament.On Saturday, Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti told a crowd at Parliament Square: “This right-wing, authoritarian Government used to encourage pro-Brexit demos and statue defenders when it suited them. “This Government bangs on about free speech and whinges about cancel culture. “It talks a good game about China and Russia and every other place in the world where fundamental rights are under attack. “But free speech is a two-way street. “And do you know what  The ultimate cancel culture, it doesn’t come with a tweet – it comes with a police baton and a prison sentence for non-violent dissent.”Former labour leader Jeremy Corbyn added: “This sense of disempowerment is designed to have a depressive effect, particularly on young people.”As it stands, the bill would put protesters at risk of y prison sentences and hefty fines for actions that cause “serious annoyance”, which could be done just by making noise, and for anyone found guilty of damaging a statue or memorial. Amendments added to the bill by the Government in the House of Lords in November make it a criminal offence to obstruct major transport works or attach oneself to objects or people, and would equip police with the power to ban named iniduals from demonstrating or even using the internet to encourage others to do so. Labour members in the House of Lords tweeted that they will be “opposing protest clauses added late on” to the wide-ranging bill in Monday’s votes. Peers are in for a marathon session tonight as votes are set to go on until the early hours of Tuesday morning.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided.

But deaths are still up % in a week to , - and , people were admitted to hospital with Covid yesterday alone. Rules on isolation in England, and Omicron restrictions in Scotland and Wales, are all being relaxed slightly.That has fuelled hope that in England, Plan B - with Covid passes for nightclubs and work-from-home guidance - will end on January .AskedPlan B will end on time, Boris Johnson ’s spokesman said today: “There are some encouraging signs that infections are falling across the country, we would want to see that mirrored in the latest ONS data as well. “There are also some signs of falls or at least plateauing in admissions and occupancy in hospital, which is good to see.However, he warned the NHS is still under signicant pressure and “we are keeping a very close eye on the data”.It’s also been reported that compulsory masks in shops and public transport, another part of England’s Plan B, will be extended. Here are the rule changes taking place from today.Covid isolation cut to five full days in EnglandThe Covid isolation period in England has been cut to five full days from today.Previously people who tested positive for Covid couldbe freed midway through their seventh full day of isolation, they test negative on days six and seven. That period has been cut by between  and  hours, after huge pressure from Tory MPs and a staffing crisis in theNHS .Under the new rules, people in England with Covid must isolate for at least five full days. They will then be able to leave isolation at the start of the sixth full day -they have tested negative for Covid on both Day  and Day .Your first full day of isolationstarts at .am, the calendar day after you test positive or show symptoms.Soyou test positive at am, aposDay apos starts  hours later.This means the new total isolation time is, in reality, somewhere between five and six days depending on what time you went into isolation. UK Health Security Agency data shows around two thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by the end of Day . This rises to %people have two negative lateral flow tests,  hours apart. In Scotland and Wales, the isolation period is still seven days . Booster vaccines for - and -year-oldsAll eligible - and -year-olds are able to book a Covid booster jab from today.Previously, boosters were only recommended for clinically vulnerable  and -year-olds who are most at risk fromCovid- . But recent data from the UKHSA showed two doses were not enough to stop people becoming unwell fromOmicron . More than , in the age group in England have had their second jab, so will be eligible for a booster. However, not all are eligible now, as they still have to wait until three months since their second dose. About , teenagers are newly eligible now, and many of the rest should become eligible in the coming weeks. Omicron restrictions rules relaxed in ScotlandScotlandaposs limit on football matches and other outdoor events has been scrapped from today.Football matches and other outdoor events in Scotlandwere limited to only  people from December ,meaning Boxing Day games were effectively fan free and Hogmanay festivities were axed.That -person limit has now been axed. Scots will still be required to show evidence of vaccination or a recent negative lateral flow test in order to access large events. Organisers of events with more than , attendees will be expected to check the Covid status of at least half of those arriving. From today, punters will only count as fully vaccinatedthey’ve had a booster, unless their second dose was less than four months ago. This change has not yet happened in England, where there’s speculation Covid passes will instead be axed on January .

HMRC figures released last week show £. billion was stolen from pandemic relief schemes such as furlough and self employment support by people claiming cash they werenapost entitled to. A taskforce set up to claw back cash recovered £ million last year, and is expecting to recover an additional £ billion from scammers. This means the Treasury only expects to recover £. billion - or £ of every £ taken - by fraudsters. The figures, first unearthed by the Times, were quietly published last week. Labour branded the figure outrageous and said the Government should have been able to help support workers without losing billions of pounds of taxpayersapos cash. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the Mirror: These confessions are outrageous. While prices soar, billions in hard-earned taxpayer cash has been frittered away by fraud - and the Chancellor is happy to shrug his shoulders and lose it forever. It shouldn’t be beyond the wit of government to get money where it needs to go, without allowing fraudsters to steal taxpayer funds. Leaving the till open and unattended for thieves to clear out would be a sackable offence for a shopworker, yet apparently it is acceptable for a Chancellor. And Shadow Business Minister Bill Esterson tweeted: You can bet this Government wouldn’t be so casualit was benefit claims. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We introduced these unprecedented Covid support schemes at speed to protect jobs and livelihoods. The result of the action is our economy is back to pre-pandemic levels, we are the first major European economy to report that. He added: Obviously fraud is unacceptable and weaposre taking against those who abuse the system - , ineligible claims blocked, £ million recovered last year, HMRC taskforce is expected to recover an additional £ billion of taxpayersapos money. HMRC boss Jim Harra admitted last year that all the money would likely never be ed. “We will not be able to recover it all, he told the Financial Times. You will reach a point of diminishing s in terms of good use of resources. “These are time-limited schemes. We do need to put them to bed at some stage and move on from them. And   is the year for which our plans go up [to]. Whether there’s anything that goes on beyond that will depend, I think, on what we find and the rate ofthat we’re getting.

Dr Prit Buttar, , revealed how he willingly breached social distancing measures to give a heartbroken pensioner a hug at a vaccine clinic during the second lockdown of .The retired GP, who ed to work during the pandemic, was vaccinating the woman in Annan when she said her husband had just died of cancer. Moved by her sadness, the doctor reached out and held her as she wept in his arms and told him that his hug was the first time anyone had embraced her since her husband’s death. Now Dr Buttar is comparing his own rule-breaking with the the Prime Minister after he was left feeling guilty for just wanting to be human.He told the Daily Record : I did what I felt was the right thing to do when breaking the rules, but to see the leaders of our country twist their drinks parties to be justied is appalling. “People have had to make serious choices when going against Covid rules and I have been feeling guilty for just wanting to be human. “We follow the restrictions because it is the only way out of this and most people, like myself, take that seriously and would only break themthe situation seriously called for it.“So to find out Boris Johnson and others have been having get togethers, and then give us terrible excuses for them, just tipped me over the edge to share my experience.Dr Buttar admitted that he has felt guilty about breaching the rules every day, but was unable to help himself as he watched his patient struggle in her grief. The Scot, who lives near Kirkcudbright, recalled how she spoke of her loneliness during her Covid vaccination appointment just one week after her husbandaposs death. The woman, in her s, had moved from England to Scotland with her husband just before the outbreak of the pandemic but he fell ill a short time later. She was unable to make any friends in her new community during lockdown while busy caring for her sick husband, meaning she was alone when he died.  Dr Buttar added: The bottom line is as I am a doctor and believe in science so I follow the rules but seeing this poor woman, I had to do something. I could tell she wanted to talk, so I abandoned my usual spiel about the vaccine, possible side-effects, and just listened. “She had been so wrapped up in caring for her husband over the past year, she hadn’t had a chance to make friends with local people, something worsened by the first lockdown. “She had dealt with his death and funeral arrangements alone, so I decided to break the rules about social distancing. The health professional recalled leaning forward in his chair and putting his arms around the grieving widow. She clung to me and wept, and sobbed into my shoulder and said aposthis is the first time anyone’s embraced me since he died.’ “I still believe it is so important to follow the rules but I felt this situation called for it.  Dr Buttar has vaccinated almost , people but said this moment really stuck out to him. “I didn’t take comforting that woman lightly just like most other ordinary people who are trying to face our painful reality,” he added. The doctor decided to share his experience and the serious choice he made after being left outraged over the news of the Downing Street parties. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologised for attending the Bring Your Own Booze gathering but insisted he thought it could have been technically within the rules. Dr Buttar said: “I came out of retirement to help with vaccines because I have a duty and obligation to help people, which is what I did with this woman. Alsosomeone had challenged me for breaking the rules and fined me I would look them in the eye and askthey wanted cash or a cheque, I would have taken responsibility for my actions like our Prime Minister should now do. He added: To see our leaders and their staff party while we faced this has left me beyond angry.

Image: Getty ImagesByKatie L Wilson:,  Jan | commentsWith today being Blue Monday, a list of the aposhappiest places in the UKapos has been compiled to help you beat the winter blues. Researchers looked at places that get the most sunlight during winter, to trigger the hormone serotonin to be released into your brain and fight off Seasonal Affective disorder . And itaposs good news for Chichester in West Sussex, which gets  sunlight hours in winter, while Bradford in West Yorkshire is the least sunny, with just .See the full lists below to see where your area ranks.Studies have shown that neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, play a role in regulating a person’s mental health and a decline can be a contributing factor towards the onset of SAD.  Seasonal affective disorder affects more than just your energy levels, explained Neil Wright, a sleep expert at Beds Divans, which commissioned the research. It also affects your sleep and day-to-day le. People with SAD often feel excessively sleepy during the day and typically sleep longer than usual at night. “Healthy sleep helps us balance our moods and regulate our emotions. Without healthy sleep, you’re more likely to struggle with feelings of depression and anxiety. In addition to boosting mood, serotonin can also aid in calming and focusing you and so, by this logic, Brits would be more likely to avoid the ‘winter blues’ in sunnier places.  The aposwinter bluesapos are caused by short and dark days during the winter months. Around two million people in the UK are affected by SAD, with two-fths of UK adults feeling more depressed due to dark nights.The lists were compiled using Met Officeweather data to compare the sunlight hours of each town and city, determining which locations were the best and worst for beating the blues. The study also found that the South East is the sunniest region in the UK, with  cities towns from that region receiving the most hours of natural sunlight, and Yorkshire and the East  West Midlands are the least sunniest regions in the UK, with only  place from each region making it into the list. Sunniest Cities  Towns in the UK Results are based on sunlight hours data from the Met Office .Chichester -  sunlight hours in winter Hastings -  St Helens -  Eastbourne -  Southend-on-Sea -  Poole -  Brighton -  Ipswich -  Peterborough -  Bournemouth - Least Sunny Cities and Towns in the UKBradford -  sunlight hours in winter Barnsley -  Rochdale -  Glasgow -  Paisley -  Belfast -  York -  Gateshead -  Preston  Sevenoaks - Neil added that there are ways to help cope with seasonal fatigue and SAD. A greater focus on self-care may be beneficial. Getting outdoors, exercising regularly, eating energy-boosting foods, and socialising can reduce the onset of SAD symptoms, said Neil. “An abrupt change in your bedtime can do harm to your mental and physical health. If you choose to go to bed earlier over the winter months, we recommend you adjust your bedtime by  hour each day until you reach your intended sleep schedule. This way there’s far more chance of getting a good night’s sleep. “The change in daylight hours can result in people losing their routines. People may begin to sleep in which can affect how youthroughout the day and your sleep schedule. “To keep in sync, you should stick to a routine and resume getting up early despite how dark it is.

Should he have his second, his mum asked me. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and any mention of a heart problem will scare parents to death, but it’s not as bad as it may seem. Just how dangerous this side effect is still isn’t clear and, according to some experts, it might not be a cause for concern at all.However, the US Food and Drug Administration has paused its approval of Moderna’s vaccine for adolescents – as it is reviewing data from Europe on the risk of myocarditis following mRNA vaccination used to combat Covid.My friend’s son is unlucky. US data shows it’s a very rare condition, occurring in only about  out of a million vaccinations. But according to the EU, Moderna’s shot is more likely to cause this ­inflammation in adolescents. Several Scandinavian countries no longer give Moderna to people under .Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section But there’s good reason for ­optimism. US data from millions of vaccinations show the inflammation, when it occurs, goes away within a matter of days without any serious consequences. Sarah Long, a ­paediatric infectious disease expert at Drexel University College of Medicine, Pennsylvania, US, and a member of the vaccine advisory  of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, thinks that the post-vaccine heart inflammation might be dferent from myocarditis from other causes. In fact, it’s so dferent, and less severe than typical myocarditis, she says, that giving it the same name has created unnecessary worry over the condition. “Let’s not call this myocarditis,” Long says. “Give me a patient with vaccine-associated myopericarditis every day over one who has true viral myocarditis.” Long says the inflammation from the vaccine is dferent from other heart inflammations as it isn’t concentrated in the heart muscle itself, it’s in the lining around it – the pericardium. Moreover, the lining isn’t essential for a healthy heart. Long also points out that surgeons sometimes remove it ­altogether during heart ops and patients come to no harm – and the CDC hasn’t recorded a single death from the condition. “In vaccine-related inflammation, everyone was up and running in five days,” says CDC scientist Matthew Oster. Children experiencing chest pain is certainly nothing to be brushed off lightly, says Long. “Nobody has died of myopericarditis, and children are dying of coronavirus,” she says. “So, of course, it’s a risk-benefit ratio that comes out in the direction of vaccination.” Wise words.

He feels that he has let so many people down, not least his mother, during her Platinum Jubilee year.” Our insider said of the royal’s ­dramatic demotion: “He had hoped that he might get some sort of stay of execution and be allowed to clear his name before his titles were removed.  “There are a number of people in the royal household who are utterly convinced that he is innocent. “But the clamour for Andrew’s scalp meant that a quick and brutal decision needed to be made.” The move, announced in a shock Palace statement on Thursday, left Andrew exiled from official royal le and facing le as a private citizen.  He is also expected to cover his own legal costs for the civil case. He was also told he will no longer be able to use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity. The move came after years of damaging speculation arising from Ms Giuffre’s claim she was forced to have sex with the duke three times when she was , including once in London.  Andrew’s plight worsened when his former friend Maxwell, , was found guilty of offences relating to her work as fixer for the Dukeaposs associate Jeffrey Epstein, a conviced paedophile and billionaire.The Duke of York has always denied the allegations and tried to explain his links with Epstein by doing an interview with BBC Newsnight where he claimed he has no recollection of ever meeting Ms Gufre. She alleges that the photo was taken at Maxwellaposs house in Belgravia, central London after a night out at Tramp nightclub in Mayfair. She claims that she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions. In a disastrous BBC Newsnight interview in , the Duke denied those claims. He insisted that an alleged encounter in  did not happen because he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey. A source close to Ms Giuffre’s legal team has now claimed she is determined to “ruin him” because of his “arrogant” behaviour. “No one can believe how badly Andrew and his legal team have messed up. His arrogance is what has destroyed him,” they said. “It is Virginiaaposs firm belief that Andrew should go to jail for what heaposs done but in the end leaving him broke and destroyed may be enough. He is already destroyed.  “Now itaposs a matter of how much money he offers [in a settlement] and how broke we leave him.” Andrew has not been arrested or charged in respect of any criminal offence and has always strenuously denied the claims.

The Prince of Wales has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren, having not seen Archie since he was six months old and not ever meeting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby daughter, Lilibet Diana, who was born in June.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and his we Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood.But Charles’s good natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. It was thought that Harry and Meghan would certainly make an effort to attend events to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee in June.What do you make of our exclusive story  Have your say in the comment section Harry is understood to have told family members he would attend a memorial service for his late grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey, which is planned for April.However, it has emerged that the Duke of Sussex claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Harry, , has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court. Royal sources have confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months.

One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. “This is something he is hoping to remedy which is why he made the gesture for Harry, Meghan and the children to stay with himthey wanted to, whenever they may come home for a period of time. “In the meantime there has been a series of good natured and enjoyable calls between them all which is something the prince very much looks forward to.” In the calls Charles, , has made it clear to his son of his wish to spend quality time with two-year-old Archie and seven-month-old baby Lilibet. Harry’s relationship with his family is understood to have been fractured following his exit from The Firm in , and subsequent decision last year to appear with Meghan, , in a tell-all interview with US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey. The couple beamoned their treatment by the family, with Harry accusing his father of cutting him off financially and further claiming a senior member of the family made racist remarks about the colour of his unborn children’s skin. Sources close to Charles have told The Mirror that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship.  One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Harry and Meghan, now live in an £million mansion in the millionaires’ playground of Montecito, Calornia, have not spent any time out of the United States since their move in . Harry is however also expected to attend the Invictus Games, which he founded, in The Hague, the Netherlands, in April.Since their exit from the family they have signed deals worth an estimated £million with streaming giants Netflix and Spoty, with the capability to earn hundreds of millions of dollars having become “financially independent”.Clarence House did not comment.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace.

He suggested a new name for the venue as Johnson is facing furious calls to resign, following reports of at least  parties across Downing Street, Whitehall and Tory HQ while millions suffered under lockdown rules. Johnson is accused of attending at least four of the events.Covid-bereaved families have blasted the bashes, and No’s repeated attempts to obscure the truth before the PM finally apologised.Daniel’s pub was previously named The Three B***ends and featured a collage of Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings with bells on their heads in October ,reports.  It was said to be a tongue-in-cheek protest at the Government’s handling of the situation when the Liverpool City Region was placed into Tier Three lockdown, forcing pubs to close. The pub was once again renamed in November , called “The Two Helmets” following Mr Cummings’ departure from Downing St. The image outside of the pub showed the PM and his former health secretary wearing hardhats, as the landlord protested about continuing restrictions on the pub-trade. Daniel pointed out that both Mr Cummings, the PM’s former chief advisor, and Mr Hancock, quit their positions within weeks of the signs going up. “Next name change for the pub ” his tweet asked.  “The first was The Three B***endsNext was The Two HelmetsSo. Two down one to go!” Daniel said the first rebrand was prompted by the government blaming the leisure sector for the spread of Covid-. He previously said his business had been “decimated” and their lack of action had compounded the problem. He said: “Westminster’s further decision to pick and choose which types of venue may open, based on those serving meals for example, is mind-boggling. ‘Whilst the renaming of the pub is clearly tongue in cheek, as far as I’m concerned the gloves are off and ministers need to understand the gravity of the perilous situation they have placed us in.  This is a town that finally feels like it’s on the up and we need funding immediately to protect our businesses and support our staff. Top civil servant Sue Gray is probing a range of the Downing Street parties, spanning May  to April , and is expected to publish a report within days. At the time of all these gatherings, indoor socialising was banned to control the spread of the virus.But ultimately the Prime Minister will get to decide himselfhe has breached the Ministerial Code. Johnson is reportedly planning to force out a string of top staff to save himself in what has been dubbed Operation Big Dog.Speaking to the media today, Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden said the Prime Minister is remorseful about allegations of Covid rule-breaking and would seek to “address the underlying culture in Downing Street”.There had been failings in No , he admitted, though he denied it was a resigning matter for Boris Johnson.

The family lost their taxpayer-funded security when the quit the royal family in  and use a private alternative for their new lives in the US. Heaposs wants pay for police assistance when heaposs in the UK - in line with the coupleaposs plan to become financially independent - but the Home Office has rejected this. Harry has now applied for a judicial review against the decision.Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed and Editor in Chief of Majesty magazine, tells the Mirror his latest move wonapost have gone down with the Queen - who is currently dealing with the fallout from Prince Andrewaposs legal case. She explains: Prince Harryaposs threat of legal action against his grandmothers government will not sit kindly with her. The Queen does not like being threatened. Even though the threat is not directed at her personally, it is a threat that comes under her jurisdiction. It will make her annoyed and very irritated. She has no desire to alienate the Duke and Duchess of Sussex , butthey continually behave like spoiled children trying to get their own way, she will be forced to do so. As youngsters both Harry and William knew exactly how their Police Protection Officers operated. They became close to them. They were together every time they left home. One even sat outside the classroom. They were friendly, efficient and unobtrusive. No wonder Harry wants that kind of protection for his we and children. But he is very unlikely to get it. Many have been left wondering what Harryaposs request will mean for his future trips to the UK, with many hoping to catch a glimpse of the Sussexes during the Queenaposs Jubilee celebrations in the summer. Ingrid says: Harry is due back to the UK in the Spring for the service of thanksgiving for the le of his grandfather, Prince Philip. He will be protected during this official engagement at Westminster Abbey. ButHarry and Meghan choose the celebrations of the Platinum Jubilee weekend to make an entry into the UK, as things stand at the present, they will not have round the clock Scotland Yard protection - unless they are with other members of the royal family. If for instance they appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony they would be afforded all the security necessary along with everyone .But when they drive home to Frogmore Cottage, their private bodyguards will be responsible for them.Once there, they are the responsibility of the Windsor Castle security. The police at Windsor recently apprehended an intruder who had climbed over the security fence. If the Sussexes don’t get their own way as regards their demand for police protection, they may decide not to come to the UK. In spite of the fuss their security risk is low. What they want is protection from photographers trying to get pictures of them and their children. The more they shield their children from public gaze the more of a target they will become. Harry’s father should tell them to let the world see Archie and Lilibet’s faces. After they are his grandchildren too. It is not up to the -year-old Queen to tell Harry how to behave. What would this do for the already tense relations within the family  If it means she never gets to meet Lilibet, it will become Harry and Meghan’s problem for the rest of their lives. And that would be very sad.

Another image shows the words burn Tory scum written along the same wall in similar style. The graffiti comes just days after a US court ruled that Virginia Giuffre, who claims that Prince Andrew abused her when she was , could proceed with legal action against him.Prince Andrew has strongly denied the claims. Buckingham Palace released a statement last Thursday saying that The Duke of York would be ing his military titles and royal patronages back to the Queen.Rory Richmond, a law student from Glasgow, posted a photo on Twitter Sunday of the graffiti aimed at the Conservatives.He wrote: “This was photographed at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh earlier today.“We must condemn and confront the mindless acts of vandalism and hatred.” The tweet has received over  likes and has had dozens of comments and retweets.Social media users were outraged by the graffiti.

The move means Andrew has been completely removed from official royal le and he now have to face his future as an ­ordinary citizen. The Duke of York was informed that he will no longer use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity by the Queen on Thursday. The decision was made after hours of deliberation between senior members of the Firm. But the summit is said to have not been straight-forward, with his lawyer left in the car park and the Prince left stunned by the outcome. Among the key revelation from the meeting, was news of a united front from Prince Charles and Prince William, who were reportedly of the view that the Duke of York has presided over a complete and utter disaster.” Andrew is also said to have been unaware about the plans, with sources describing him as shell-shocked at the move.

Sonia, an alternative therapist and husband Chris, a musician, had decided once their sons were older it was time to show off their iniduality in their home. The couple, from Coventry, filled the four-bed property with artwork, stylish patterns and bold designs - avoiding the cliche aposlight and airyapos look of many minimalist makeovers. They went for darker colours and insist it does not make the house smaller, but provides a cosy home that comes alive in the winter. Sonia said: We moved here in  and it was all beige walls. It was very bland with nothing about it really. But we had two young kids and we didnapost really know what our style was when the boys were little. We never liked the way it was decorated, but when you have young children, itaposs sometimes hard to show your personality at home. We looked into what we wanted our home to be like for us and we ripped up the laminate to find floorboards and found original tiles in the hallway. We started to find quirky features in the house and embraced them. The couple started their top-to-bottom transformation in . Their sons Evan, , and Cassius, , still live in the house. Sonia said: I decorate with my feelings and for us, our home has such a cosy and comforting feel to it. I feel like the lounge hugs you as you walk in. We encompass the darkness and embrace it.I adore the open fire, that sold the house to me and it brings the house alive in winter.Sonia admits friends and family were unsure when they revealed their decorating style but the couple insists using darker colours doesnapost cramp the space. She said: Itaposs not a massive house, no high ceilings and when we said we wanted to go dark with our design ideas people said it will make the room smaller, but honestly thataposs rubbish.  for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.She added:People either love it or itaposs too dark for them to live in. But for me itaposs not too much. I love that itaposs not an empty shell and instead it is filled with things we love. Sonia says she loves to make things or buy from charity shops. She said: A lot of the things in this house I have made, the red tassel lampshade and some artwork.The mannequin heads I found on eBay and turned them into wall planters. I like pieces that are unique and not something you can buy in every shop.Sonia has shared her transformation on her Instagram account @Itsonlytakenyears. She added: My favourite room has to be the living room and one of my favourite features in the house is the fireplace. Our little dining area in the kitchen is so cosy. I hand stencilled the gold stars and I gold leafed the tiles in the kitchen. The kitchen cupboards were fine, but not to our taste so we just changed the handles and painted the front of them. In our dining area, I like to repurpose everything so we repainted our table and chairs. It cost around £ to transform the bathroom and most of that was buying a new toilet seat. Sonia painted the lounge and dining room the same colour to create a flow between the rooms but painted the hallway a light pink and used a grey carpet.

Hannah Baker attended appointments and undergone surgical procedures for abdominal pain and bleeding in hospital. But she was distraught after her requests for a smear test were denied because was under  at the time. And now she is unable to have children because she has had cervical cancer. Cervical screening is available to women and people with a cervix aged  to  in England. But Hannah was diagnosed with the disease in March  when she . Now , she instructed specialist medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate her care and whether her cancer could have been diagnosed sooner. She is hopeful for a family after lawyers secured a settlement to fund her surrogacy.Frimley Health NHS Foundation trust, carried out an internal investigation and recommended any woman, irrespective of age, who is undergoing cervical cautery, should have a cervix biopsy of the before having treatment.Following legal submissions, the trust has now agreed an undisclosed six-figure settlement but has denied liability. Hannah underwent surgery to safeguard her oies for future fertility treatment before having chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy and brachytherapy.

At the same time as trying to comprehend I had cancer I was trying to come to terms with the grief of losing my baby and thatI beat the disease Iaposd struggle to be able to conceive and that I needed to save my oies. When I look back I still feel a lot of anger and frustration about what happened and everything Iaposve been through. Iaposm very fortunate that Iaposve had the support of my family and Joe and Iaposm proud of how far Iaposve come considering what Iaposve had to deal with. Having children is something Iaposve wanted ever since I can remember. The thought of one day having a family was a major driver for me in getting through the cancer treatment. Because of what Iaposve been through Iaposm keen to try and raise awareness of cervical cancer to ensure other women donapost have to share my experiences. I was told I was too young for a smear test but I believe theyaposre so important.

Tell me, what is the monkey doing , the operator asks as Travisaposs harrowing, almost gleeful, wails and screeches echo down the line. He ripped her apart! Hurry up! Hurry up! Please!” Herold breathlessly replies. “He—he ripped her face off! Heaposs eating her face! “Gun! They got to shoot him! Please! Please! Hurry! Hurry! Please! I can’t. I can’t … He’s eating her! He’s eating her! Please! God! Please! Where are they  Where are they ” Officers did come and Travis was killed. Astonishingly, his victim, Charla Nash, survived, but you could argue that in many ways, her le too came to an abrupt end that day.  Charla, a friend of Travisapos aposmomapos Sandra, had been asked to pop over to help put the pampered ape in his enclosure - but, uncharacteristically, he snapped, attacking her and gnawing off her face and hands. In a show of terrying primal strength, Travis ripped off her eyelids and tore off her nose. He scalped her, gouged out and ate her eyes, chewed off one of her hands entirely and almost tore one of her arms off. Her jaw was entirely dislocated from her skull and she was left with brain damage. It is still not known why Travis - a local celebrity who would eat lobster in restaurants, had a pet cat, and loved driving around on a lawnmower - flipped out the way that he did that day.  Sandra later admitted giving him a dose of strong anti-anxiety medicine Xanax in his daily cup of tea earlier that day when she noticed that he was aposagitatedapos. She also claimed that he behaved viciously because Charla was wearing her hair dferently. But it could also have been that at the age of , the lbapeaposs instincts had simply become too strong - or that he was simply sick of his unnatural lestlye of cooking his own microwave meals, drinking wine at dinner, and using the toilet like a human. Sandra had owned Travis since he was just three days old, paying a breeder , for the infant chimp.  His mum was shot with a tranquiliser dart so that he could be stolen away - and from that moment on, he was no longer a chimpanzee, but Sandraaposs apossonapos. To outsiders they had an unbreakable bond, and even shared a bed after Sandraaposs husband died. After the attack on February , , the then -year-old told reporters: He couldnapost be more my son thanI gave birth to him. But everything has a breaking point, and for Sandra, that came when she saw her beloved aposlittle boyapos mauling her best friend.  Due to Charlaaposs horric injuries, Sandra was the only person able to explain exactly what had prompted the attack. She claimed Travis approached Charla aggressively before getting onto his hind legs and launching the savage attack, throwing her against the side of her car before gorging on her face and hands. Desperate, Sandra stabbed him in the back with a carving kne and battered him over the head with a shovel in a bid to make him stop, which it did for a moment. She recalled how he turned around and looked at her, before she ran for her le and locked herself in her car.  Sandra said: “I grabbed the shovel and hit him with the shovel to stop it. It wasnapost working, so I went and I had to get a kne — and I stabbed him. I had to. He looked at me like, ‘Mom, what did you do ’” When police arrived, Travis was in a frenzy of bloodlust. He opened one of their patrol caraposs doors and lunged at an officer. Despite being shot four times at point blank range Travis didnapost die. He ran back in to the house, and collapsed dead on his special bed, leaving a trail of blood behind him.  The gunshots are heard in the background of Sandraaposs breathless  call. When paramedics arrived on the scene they were unable to decipher the victimaposs gender due to the severity of the wounds. Like something from a horror film, strips of flesh and scalp had been flung around the yard of Sandraaposs Stamford, Connecticut, home. They assumed that Charla, who was a mass of bloodied flesh with no recognisable facial features slumped in a pool of her own blood, was dead - until she moved. They sprung into action, and managed to save her le.  The brutal attack had caused her to lose half of her blood and she would later undergo a face transplant. Sadly, a pioneering hand transplant was rejected by her body. After the incident, NBC reporter Jeff Rossen asked Sandra: “After what youaposve been through with this — your friend is in the hospital fighting for her le — do you still think chimps should be pets  She replied: “Would I have done it again  Yes! Theyaposre the closest thing to humans — to us. “We can give them a blood transfusion, and they can give us one. How many people go crazy and kill other people  This is one incident that I donapost know what happened. “It was a horrible thing. But Iaposm not a horrible person. And he wasnapost a horrible chimp. It was a freak thing.”  Fteen months later Sandy died from an aneurysm. She was buried with two urns beside her. One was her daughteraposs, the other belonged to Travis. The only survivor of that hideous day is Charla Nash, who now lives in darkness, wearing someone aposs face and entirely dependent on the staff at the care home where she will spend the rest of her days. Ahead of the face transplant she spoke to Oprah Winfrey, and rued the loss of the le she loved. She said: Iaposve never been a quitter. Unfortunately, thereaposs not a whole lot I can do. “I’ve lost so much independence. I could change my own truck tyre, and now I can’t even feed myself. Itaposs very hard to live. Not even live - half-live. “Sometimes you want to cry, you want out, you want some kind of home. I donapost know what my future is, thataposs the scary part.

The couple had no idea the secret room was there, until they spotted rotten floorboards and decided to investigate the cause. On exploring the hidden cellar, the couple found it was flooded with water and rubble, so -year-old Ben decided to put it on the backburner while renovating the rest of the property.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Ben, who works as a sign maker, said: There was some issues with rotten floorboards and the person I bought the house from wouldnapost let me explore any further until we had moved in. I had an incline something was hidden underneath after noticing a lot of the houses on our street had cellars and steps leading down. I took a gamble and guessed where the stairwell would be and managed to cut the hatch out and found a flooded cellar.  It was in terrible condition there was a foot of water and rubble. It was rotting the floorboards and joists so I had to replace all of them. I saw it as an exciting bonus despite the fact it needed a lot of work. When work finally began on the hidden room, the couple decided to transform the old cellar into a state of the art home cinema and playroom for one-year-old daughter Bella.  They spent £, on transforming the old, rotting cellar into a home cinema complete with a custom made sofa, projector, and bar area. Ben added: I shopped around and used a lot of secondhand materials. I made my own system to pump out the water so Iaposve managed to save a lot of money by doing the work myself. The work started in October  but was only recently finished as it was an ongoing project. Thereaposs a large l-shaped lounger, shelving racks, popcorn machine, sweet vending machine, a mini fridge, a projector, and a bar area. Itaposs around  square metres and a fully ing room which weaposre happy we discovered.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

My dad confessed he was in love with the other woman and wanted to leave my mother, the woman wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum. She obviously heartbroken and didn’t know what to do, as we had moved to a new state with my father for work so she had no family around. My father dropped us like a bad habit, he attempted to keep a relationship with me, but ultimately his new family was aposhis priorityapos as he said. Tough to understand for a  year old, but whatever. If he didn’t want me, I wasn’t going to need him so my mother and I moved on. The only way we were able to move on was with the help of my grandmother, my fatheraposs mother. She always loved us and was appalled with what her son had done to us. He stopped seeing her as well for the most part. Over the years, the woman and her mum became increasingly close with her grandmother, often spending special occasions and holidays together, while her dad was nowhere to be found. Unfortunately, the years caught up with her and she developed colon cancer, advanced late stage. Her decline was rapid. Within a few months she was in hospice, the woman continued.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Days before she passed, she asked me to call her son to come see her as she knew her time was coming. He’d only been to see her a couple times since she had gotten sick. When he came by, I was visiting as we did every few days and he acted like I was some random person. Grandma asked him to come back tomorrow, but he said he’d be back in a few days. She passed  days later without him coming back despite my calls and texts to come. She went peacefully with me and my mom by her side. That was hard. I miss her every day. She was myangel most of my le and I know she continues to watch over me. After the funeral and everything took place, the woman and her mum were contacted by her grandmotheraposs lawyer, who revealed she had, in fact, left both her home and , to her in her will. I had no idea she did that, but in the will, there was a note to me from her that said: aposYou are worth it. Love Grandma.apos She’s amazing, the woman added. Also in her will, she left my father exactly  as his inheritance. When he found out, he went ballistic, blowing up my phone all the time demanding I give him aposhis house and his money.apos His new we and his son were messaging me a lot and his son was writing on social media that I manipulated my grandmother.  Eventually, the womanaposs father apologised for his behaviour and explained he was under a lot of stress because heaposs in debt and was expecting a windfall from his mum to help cover his bills and send his son to college, leading her to feel bad and question whether she should share the money after all. Iaposve thought about it a lot and I don’t think I’m going to share anything with him and I kind of think that makes me an a**hole because it seems like they really do need it, but on the other hand f*** him. One Reddit user replied: The reason she left him  was to make it clear to the Court in case he tried to challenge the will, that she hadn’t forgotten to include him, but that she intended to disinherit him. She knew that her son would try to take the money she left you. It is very common practice to leave  when disinheriting someone. Respect your grandmothers wishes and don’t give your father a dime. A second wrote: The reason your grandma gave him exactly  is so that he couldnapost contest it. She did not want him to gain anything from her passing. She knew what she was doing. Honour her wishes.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

A fierce debate has raged in the comment section of her video and some have branded her advice as aposunrealisticapos while others said theyaposd give her tips a aposhard passapos. What do you think of Kacieaposs tips  Let us know in the comments...Kacie, from Australia, said: I’m a professional cleaner and these are my five non-negotiable cleaning tasks. Make your bed every morning, give high traffic areas a hoover or mop, pick clothes up off the floor evenitaposs to put them in a basket. Never take todayaposs dishes into tomorrow, and clean your countertop after every meal. After sharing the video on TikTok, the video was viewed , times and Kacie was inundated with comments. One said: Iaposm proud to say I do this every day and always have done.  And another wrote: Iaposm not a professional cleaner and those things are just natural, I vacuum daily, dishes are done as theyaposre used, simple. Then a third added: Great tips. These are not hard at all. Surprised at some comments. Youaposd think these would be normal tasks I.e. picking up after yourself. I do this every day and Iaposve got four kids, a fourth user said. Iaposd rather wake up to a tidy house than a messy one. But soon the negative comments came rolling in, as one said: Hard pass lol, I admire that who do, but I have dferent priorities. A second commented: This is great and I love it, but this isnapost realistic for some of us. And a third added: Yeah, this would make a professional cleaneraposs job easier for them when they arrive.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Bosco is only -weeks-old but he has already grown into quite the powerhouse and is so enormous his owner struggles to hold him in her arms. Comments on the video sharing  were filled with people totally baffled by the young dogaposs size - and speculating about just how big he could grow to be. In the clip viewers see the beautul puppy gazing adorably into the camera, as his owner battles to hold him up. Meanwhile big Bosco flashes an adorable grin at the camera and licks his lips, likely expecting a treat for being such a good boy. The clip, which was uploaded by TikTok user @bossdiggitydawg, is set to the popular Blink- song ‘What’s My Age Again’ matching Bosco’s bewildering size.The video was a hit on the app, with over , views and more than , likes. Viewers were clearly amazed by the dogaposs size, with one user commenting: “He’s going to be built like a horse.” Another commenter wrote: “He is gorgeous. He is going to be between  to  lbs. My last Rottie was  lbs at six months and weighed  lbs at two years old.”  A third added: “That’s a classic Rottie bear cub right there. Lol. Handsome boy. He’s going to be huge.”Another Rottweiler called Pluto went viral on TikTok recently as he left viewers sobbing after showing how a dog might greet their owner in heaven.The video captured hearts as Pluto was seen bounding towards his owner through a field as emotional music played. Viewers were left imagining that this might be what it looks like to be greeted by your dog in heaven. In another adorable video Harper the Rottweiler was totally unimpressed when her clumsy brother, Hudson, showed a complete disregard for social distancing and took a seat directly on her legs and backside.Hudson, who is a Bernese mountain dog, is clearly lacking in self-awareness when it comes to his size, much to the dismay of his sister.

Her photo shows the entire sky lit up red as she looked out over a calm ocean. Desperate family members had appealed for help finding Angela Glover, but a body was today found in the search for her. Her brother said she had been attempting to rescue dogs with her husband when huge waves battered the island, where she had lived since .  Angela, who ran a dog sanctuary in Tongaaposs capital, Nukuaposalofa, was swept away as the island was hit by ft waves on the west coast of Tongatapu, the countryaposs main island. Her husband James was able to cling on to a tree, and it is believed he later discovered Angelaaposs body. Speaking outside the family home in Sussex, her brother Nick Eleini said the family was devastated by the tragedy. “She was beautul. She was a ray of sunshine, he said.  She would just walk into a room and lighten the room up and she loved her le, both when she was working in London and then she achieved her le’s dream of going to work in the south Pacic. “She always wanted to swim with whales - that was a childhood ambition and that is what drove her to Tonga but she loved her le there and we are so proud of her achievements in Tonga with both her and James starting a business and creating a le there are her charity work with Tonga Animal Welfare Society. She was so committed to it.“She loved animals and dogs particularly.The uglier the dog, the more she loved it. We would laugh at her when she sent us these photos on Facebook of dogs she had rescued. She was a lovely girl and she was the centre of our family.We’re just broken.” He said Angela had been washed away with four or five dogs who she was walking at the time. The couple were housesitting a home on the west coast of the island. In a statement Mr Eleini added: “Angela and James loved their le in Tonga and adored the Tongan people, in particular they loved the Tongan love of family and Tongan culture. Family friend Donna Head, posted on Facebook : “The worst news possible has been confirmed by family members. Our Ange did not survive the Tonga Tsunami.“I have no words other than I’m utterly heartbroken and numb. May our beautul friend rest in peace. Ange, I will look out for your mum, I promise.

Former FBI agent Vincent Pankoke was part of the -strong team of investigators who revealed the “well-known notary” as the guilty party. Their detective work has been chronicled by author Rosemary Sullivan in her book The Betrayal of Anne Frank. The investigation into van den Bergh began in  when a filmmaker and Dutch journalist began trying to find the betrayer and they brought Mr Pankoke on board.  He worked closely with Ms Sullivan and Monique Koemans, a senior advisor to the Dutch government. A list of suspects was narrowed down to  and eventually one. Ms Sullivan said: “We looked at each person and it was in terms of opportunity, motive and knowledge.” They also examined the findings of two previous investigations. Among the documents was a letter sent anonymously to Otto, who died in  aged , which said van den Bergh had revealed his hiding place. When the investigators found the note van den Bergh is alleged to have handed to the Nazis there were no names on it so it could be argued he did not know the identity of those in hiding. Despite the Frank family’s tragic end, Ms Sullivan urges readers not to view van den Bergh, who died in , too harshly. She said: “I don’t think anybody can judge van den Bergh unless they were in his situation…you knew your children were going to be exterminated, to give away an address with no name – it mitigates. “He did not turn over information out of wickedness or for self-enrichment as so many others had. Like Otto Frank’s, his goal was... to save his family.” And Mr Pankoke believes van den Bergh’s identity had remained secret for so long because of fears it would incite anti-Semitism. “Perhaps it was just felt it’ll only stoke the fires further,” he told CBS  Minutes.

HurtByAntony Thrower:,  Jan | commentsA new planet with three times the mass of Jupiter has been discovered in the galaxy. Dubbed TOI- b, the planet was found by Citizen Scientist Tom Jacobs using data collected by Nasa’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite . The gas giant orbits its stars in just  days- compared to Jupiter which takes around  Earth years to travel around our Sun. The discovery was reported in the Astronomical Journal. Tom found TO having taken part in the Planet Hunter initiative which looks at the collected data. He spotted something irregular in February  and flagged it to two scientists, who later confirmed the find. He said: “Discovering and publishing TOI- b was a great group effort demonstrating that professional astronomers and seasoned citizen scientists can successfully work together.  “It is synergy at its best.” Scientists say the planet is around  lightyears away from Earth and has around  earth masses of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Around , exoplanets have been confirmed with billions more suspected to be in our galaxy. Paul Dalba, from the University of Calornia, Riverside, added: “The manual effort that they put in is really important and really impressive because it’s actually hard to write code that can go through a million light curves and identy single transit events reliably,” “This is one area where humans are still beating code.” It comes as an asteroid bigger than any building on Earth is set to soar past the planet tomorrow. It has been named and is more than a kilometre wide at , metres- making it bigger than the worldaposs tallest building the Burj Khala in Dubai which is  metres . However, it poses no threat to Earth and when it passes it will still be more than five times the moonaposs distance from the planet.

And while some dogs might enjoy a quick game of fetch, others don’t realise when their owners have thrown the ‘invisible’ ball.But Tipsy goes the extra mile - quite literally - to chase her beloved ball.When her owner Jessi Burk, from London, in Canada, showed Tipsy her ball, she stopped dead in her tracks, paws poised and ready. Jessi threw the orange and blue ball over the other side of the sheep fence, and Tipsy - who’s been trained not to go over or through the fence - set off in a sprint in the opposite direction.  Taking the long way around, Tipsy ran through the gate, down the path and around the trees to retrieve her ball, ready for another throw. Other dog owners have shared how their dogs would have behaved in the same situation - and they’re vastly dferent to Tipsy’s marathon around the farm. One said: “My malinois would simply bulldoze the fence.” Another added: “My Doberman would stand at the fence and bark at the ball… for hours.”  One suggested tying string to the ball and pull it back when it almost gets there to seethe collie would run all the way back around. The two-year-old dog isn’t the only sheepdog to offer the internet a good giggle in recent months, either. Lucy Jones’ short-coated border collie is a talented herding dog, but had everyone in stitches after ‘pulling the wool’ over their eyes.In a TikTok video viewed nearly a million times, the collie sits perfectly still in the sheep barn, surrounded by his woolly workmates.But the dog is wrapped up in sheared sheep wool with just his little head poking out, hoping that no-one will notice that he’s an imposter. And where, farm dog Marshall loves his job so much, he herds whatever he can get his paws on - including his favourite football. His owner, Lisa Alekna, shared an adorable video of the dog stalking a ball in the garden whilst patiently awaiting for instructions from the shepherdess. She instructed him to ‘walk up’ and ‘stand’ as Marshall continued creeping towards the target.The farmer explained to Marshall’s TikTok viewers that the clever dog would ignore commands he didn’t want to do, until Lisa offered him a better instruction.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Red Cross said it was preparing to respond to what it called the worst volcanic eruption the Pacic has experienced in decades. Up to , people could have been affected by the tsunami, according to Katie Greenwood of the charity. One British woman was reported missing after trying to save her dogs with her husband and getting washed away by a wave. Angela Glover, who runs a dog rescue shelter on the island, was swept away with the animals while her husband James managed to hold onto a tree, according to New Zealand state broadcaster TVNZ. Tsunami warnings and evacuation orders were also triggered in neighbouring countries, including Japan and the east coast of Australia. Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Haaposapai has erupted regularly over the past few decades but the impact of Saturdayaposs blast was felt as far away as Japan and the United States. Australia and New Zealand sent surveillance flights on Monday to assess damage in Tonga, isolated from the rest of the world. Initial reports suggest no mass casualties took place form Saturdayaposs eruption and tsunami, according to Australiaaposs Minister for the Pacic Zed Seselja. But Australian police had visited beaches and reported signicant damage with houses thrown around.  We know there is some signicant damage, and know there is signicant damage to resorts, Mr Seselja said adding that Tongaaposs airport appeared to be in relatively good condition. Surveillance flights will assess the situation in outer islands where communication is completely cut off. Tongaaposs deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tuaposihalangingie, asked for patience as Tongaaposs government decides its priorities for aid.The nation is concerned about the risk of aid deliveries spreading Covid- to the island, which is currently free from the virus.We donapost want to bring in another wave - a tsunami of Covid-, Mr Tuaposihalangingie said. When people see such a huge explosion they want to help.  He went on to highlight how Tonga diplomats were also concerned by some private fundraising efforts and urged the public to wait until a disaster relief fund was announced. Any aid sent to Tonga would need to be quarantined, and it was likely no foreign personnel would be allowed to disembark aircraft, he said. The eruption of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Haaposapai volcano triggered a tsunami on the shores of Tonga and cut off phone and internet lines for the entire island. International communication has been severely hampered by damage to an undersea cable which could take more than a week to restore. Australia and New Zealand were assisting with satellite calls, he said.  Telephone networks in Tonga have been restored but ash was posing a major health concern, contaminating drinking water. Most people are not aware the ash is toxic and bad for them to breath and they have to wear a mask, Tuaposihalangingie said.The Haaposatafu Beach Resort,  miles outside the capital Nukuaposalofa, was completely wiped outaposapos, the owners said on Facebook.The family that manages the resort had run for their lives through the bush to escape the tsunami, it said. The whole western coastline has been completely destroyed along with Kanukupolu village,aposapos the resort said. Two people drowned off a beach in Northern Peru due to high waves caused by the tsunami. More than a day after the eruption, countries thousands of kilometres to the west have volcanic ash clouds over them, New Zealand forecaster WeatherWatch said. Early data suggests the eruption was the biggest blast since Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines  years ago, New Zealand-based volcanologist Shane Cronin told Radio New Zealand. This is an eruption best witnessed from space, Cronin said.

There were many contributing factors according to the sherf, some of which would have been avoided with the crystal clear benefit of hindsight.As the sherf noted, the owners took pride in their vessel, kept it well maintained and considered it to be a safe boat. They were managing it little dferently to many others up and down the Scottish coast.But, crucially, no stability rules applied to boats like the Nancy Glen at the time of the accident.Duncan MacDougall was an experienced fisherman who knew these waters well and,it could happen to his boat, there is an obvious need to raise awareness to prevent such devastating accidents in future."},{"url":null,"title":"a dry ish year helped by july heat","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.A relatively dry year,  had a total precipitation of ,. mm , eight millimetres shy of the -year average but a more impressive .mmbelow the -year norm.Eight months of the year had precipitation below the long-term average but February, August and October saw signicantly more rain than would normally be expected.Worth noting is that five of the top dozen wettest years on record have occurred in the last decade.

When Neil was appointed, he knew how important it was for Gala to play a certain way. His philosophy matched the club’s which was really exciting.“When the club decided to appoint Neil there were a few people outside the club that were very surprised as we finished in th place the season before but we knew that we got the right man for the job to bring back that identity and produce a team that the town could be proud of.“Since then we have gone from strength to strength and it has been the most successful period of the club’s history with a th place league finish and progressing to the third round of the Scottish Cup this year narrowly being defeated by League  contenders Annan Athletic.“I can’t thank Neil, the coaching staff and the players enough over the last few seasons and wish him all the best for the future.

They have continued to support and help me during my time at the club and for that I will be forever grateful.“Secondly, I would like to thank everyone behind the scenes at the club. At Gala this group is not a huge number and all of them are volunteers and at any level there is a lot of time  work that must be put in to get games on.“Washing strips, setting up goals, running turnstiles and hospitality, are all jobs that need to be done and both the players and I appreciate it.“Finally, I need to thank all of the players and every member of staff who have been at the club during my time. Please believe me none of them pay their mortgage from being at the club but their commitment  the sacrices they have made have been second to none.“I believe we currently have a fantastic group of players and staff who I have enjoyed working and spending time with!“In football there are many ups and downs and during my time at the club this has been no dferent.

Regrettably, the principle of development is not considered acceptable in this location.”.removeIt adds: “The planning authority understands the applicant’s circumstances and need to find alternative, fit for purpose family accommodation that meets their very specic needs. Unfortunately, their very specic personal circumstances are not material to the assessment of this application and cannot be taken into account when determining the acceptability, or otherwise, of the proposed development.”However, at the meeting Mr Moffat, of the SNP, moved a formal proposal to approve the plans which was seconded by Hawick representative Clair Ramage.He said: “The family want to stay in the community where they have got a support mechanism.

It could include an exemption for smaller levels of saving.”The committee added that automatic appointments with Pension Wise should be trialled, to help support people to make better decisions.There should be one appointment when a person accesses their pension for the first time and also one at the age of , before they can access their pension savings, the committee suggested.The pension freedoms, introduced in , give people a much wider range of choices over what to do with their pension, rather than being required to buy a retirement annuity.The Committee said that, although Pension Wise offers a good service, not enough people use it.During an inquiry, the Committee was told by the Financial Conduct Authoritythat consumers describe pensions as a “minefield”, with even those who felt financially confident in other aspects of their lives struggling to understand how pensions work.Stephen Timms, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said the pensions landscape “is in a constant state of change”.He said: “It’s little wonder therefore that – as the Government’s own financial regulator recognises – people struggle to navigate the pensions minefield..remove“When the  reforms were introduced, the Government guaranteed that savers would be given the tools they needed to take advantage of the new range of options and make well-informed decisions. Seven years on, guidance remains the missing piece of the pension freedoms jigsaw.“Nudging savers will not be enough. The Government and regulators can no longer just sit on their hands as decision making becomes ever more complicated.“They must end their timidity and be much more active in supporting people as they approach retirement. We know that those who use Pension Wise find it useful and often make dferent choices as a result. Every effort should be made to boost its use.“Without intervention to drive up dramatically the numbers receiving advice and guidance, savers will make poor decisions – and, in far too many cases, become scam victims – and the pension freedoms, far from living up to their name, will instead trap people in an increasingly confusing web of complexity.”The FCA should look to increase the number of people choosing a mixture of retirement products which could benefit them, the report suggested.For example, someone may benefit from withdrawing a lump sum when they first access their pension and at a later stage in their le choose an annuity, which guarantees an income.The pensions advice allowance, which allows £ to be withdrawn from a pension up to three times in dferent tax years for advice, should also be overhauled with the annual limit removed and the Money and Pensions Service and advisers encouraged to signpost its use, it said.Commenting on the report, Phil Brown, director of policy at BCE, provider of the People’s Pension, said: “More must be done to help savers understand risks such as longevity and inflation, as well as how investments work.“Although Pension Wise is a very good service, it isn’t the only solution to this problem and providers need to develop products which will help retirees safely spend their money, while optimising the way they continue to save during retirement.”Laura Myers, a partner at financial consultancy LCPsaid: “For many savers the most attractive feature of saving in a pension is the ability to take % of the pension pot in the form of tax-free cash.“The problem is that far too little attention is given to what happens to the other %.“This can end up in a poor value drawdown product or, worse still, be fully withdrawn and sit in a current account or cash Isa with ultra-low s.”Baroness Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, said: “Helping more people understand pensions and making them work better through retirement can also help improve the reputation of pensions, encourage more people to leave their money invested for longer and ultimately have more money in later le, rather than rushing to take out money as soon as they can and possibly paying unnecessary tax.”Yvonne Braun, director of long-term savings at the Association of British Insurerssaid: “Decisions about accessing a pension are some of the most complex financial decisions people make in their letime, and many savers will be unsure of the best course of action.”A Department for Work and Pensionsspokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring people have the support and information they need to make informed choices about their financial futures, striking the right balance between providing vital protections and informing pension savers, while also giving them freedom and choice about how to use their hard-earned pension savings.“Our stronger nudge measures will require pension scheme trustees to offer to book a Pension Wise appointment for a saver, unless they actively decide to opt out of receiving guidance through a separate communication.“Since November, our new transfer regulations have bolstered protections for savers by empowering trustees and scheme managers to halt a transfer request where they suspect it could end up in the hands of a fraudster.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Savers need stronger support to navigate pensions minefield, say MPs"},{"url":null,"title":"efl-working-resolve-derby-countys-administration-impasse","story":"The EFL says it is committed to resolving “a complex legal position” that is threatening Derby’s bid to find a buyer and exit administration.Derby went into administration last September and have been docked  points for breaching EFL financial rules.The Sky Bet Championship club’s administrators are understood to be in talks with three potential buyers, but have been unable to name a preferred bidder due to the threat of legal action against Derby by two other clubs.EFL statement: Derby County.#EFLhttps:t.co meVpENjAh— EFL CommunicationsJanuary , Middlesbrough and Wycombe are seeking compensation for loss of earnings in relation to Derby’s financial breaches and potential new owners are reluctant to commit themselves to further liabilities.The EFL said in a statement on its official website: “The current situation remains challenging as Middlesbrough and Wycombe Wanderers consider their claims should be protected under the terms of the Insolvency Policy.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists.

Instead, it is based on the evidence-based, historical fact of Jesus# resurrection: #[God] has given us … hope# – a Bible term for #certainty# – #through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.# Because Jesus is alive, bodily, physically and in real time and space raised from death, we can have certainty even in these uncertain times in which we live."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll ranked one of the most peaceful locations in britain","story":"With demand for rural retreats rising and more people looking to escape the typical tourist hotspots for a tranquil break, holiday provider Cottages in Northumberland carried out research to find the top places to find peace and quiet in England, Scotland and Wales.Thinking about what makes an area quiet – no people, no noise, no light pollution and lots of nature and wildle – Cottages in Northumberland pulled together data covering population count, National Park counts and Dark Sky sites.This data was then ranked to reveal the UK#s quietest areas as follows:  Powys, Wales  Northumberland, England  The Highlands, Scotland  Argyll and Bute, Scotland  Morayshire, Scotland  North Yorkshire, England  Pembrokeshire, Wales  Cumbria, England  Aberdeenshire, Scotland  Devon, England.Just missing out on a podium spot, Argyll and Bute ranked highly thanks to the area#s low population count of  people per square kilometre, which is actually the third lowest count in the UK overall, following the Scottish Highlands and Western Isles.Being home to Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park and the internationally recognised Isle of Coll Dark-Sky Community also helped boost Argyll and Bute#s position.The only Scottish location to rank higher was the Highlands which came third in the overall rankings.Having the lowest population count in the whole of the UK, with a mere nine people per square kilometre, helped to elevate the Highlands into the bronze position.It also home to the Cairngorms National Park which is a centre for outdoor activity, with mountains, lochs, woodland forests and rivers, as well as small local villages which are lovely to explore.And whilst the Highlands does not have an internationally recognised Dark Sky park, it does have  Milky Way sites, ranking it second in the UK for Dark Sky sites.In second place, Northumberland was deemed England#s quietest place.The coastal county, which houses Northumberland National Park, has a low population count of  people per square kilometre.It is also well known for its stargazing potential, boasting one Dark Sky Orion site and  Milky Way sites – more sites than anywhere  in the UK.And taking the top spot, Powys in Wales was officially crowned the best place for peace and quiet in Great Britain.With a population count of  people per square kilometre, and home to the Brecon Beacons National Park where there are endless woodlands, waterfalls, hills, moorlands, and heritage sites to explore, Powys is undoubtedly a place of peace and serenity."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

Some years, the harvest had been better than others, and some trees gave their fruit easier than others. He’d learnt not to expect a good harvest, but hope for one, after caring for the trees in all the ways he’d learnt.But he knew what the problem was. The trees were old. He had pruned them and cared for them in all the ways he knew, but now was the time to plant new treeshe was to enjoy an abundant harvest in future years.But where to plant  He walked about his garden trying to decide the best location.He was a very lucky man, it was an extensive garden and his le’s joy. He knew what was needed, the type of soil, the position so there was enough sunlight, sheltered so the spring buds would be protected from the chill winds. Then he realised the perfect place to create his new orchard: close by the wall at the far end of the garden.He wanted to plant from seeds, and he used the technique his grandfather had taught him so many years ago. So he set to work, first preparing the soil, and then he began planting.The trees would grow up together and help each other to flourish, he thought.Years went by and his new trees did indeed grow. Passers-by would often see him standing admiring their progress.But there were some unkind whisperers in the village, who said mocking things about the old man and his new apple trees.“Does he not realise he will be dead before those trees bear fruit  What a foolish man to waste his time and energy on something he will never enjoy himself. If he had children it might make sense, but he doesn’t.”The unkind whispers of course reached the old man’s ears. But it didn’t stop him standing by the new trees and admiring them, and helping them in the ways he knew, to grow healthily. As each year went by, the new trees got bigger and stronger, but the old man got weaker.Then one spring, he was unable to venture into his garden to admire their blossom. People noticed his absence and they wondered about him.Soon the news was out: he was very ill. One of his neighbours came to see him.They had been le-long friends and every autumn the old man had shared his apples with her, giving her a large basket of them to share with her big family.It was sadly their last meeting, for the old man passed away before the beginning of summer. When autumn arrived, the apple trees he’d planted bore their first fruit. It all seemed so sadly ironic.But then one day during the autumn, the neighbour’s grandchildren came running into her house, looking excited.“Gran, gran, look!” they called out, holding a handful of ripe, juicy-looking apples.“They were lying in your garden, on the grass over there, can we eat them ”She went to look. The old man had planted the new apple trees close to the low-lying wall where they had always had their conversations.It was the place where they had made and maintained their friendship, always talking and catching up.It was at this wall that he would hand over the basket of apples every autumn.Now the apple trees he’d planted had grown tall, and some of the branches arched above her lawn. The trees seemed to be offering her apples.She realised now why he’d planted the seeds there.Then she noticed that some of the trees were growing by the old man’s other wall, which bordered the main road.The old man used to leave a basket of apples by his gate for the children as they were walking to school. Now the trees arched over the grassy verge next to the pavement, displaying their fruit.They were just out of reach, butthe children were inventive and cooperated with each other, they could find ways to pick them.She reached up and picked a ripe-looking apple, just the way he’d taught her all those years ago when they’d first become friends. She looked at it and smiled.She looked over the wall to the place he used to stand when they had their conversations. She would never see him standing there again, she thought, never have those conversations again.But then she looked at the apple she had picked and smiled. Her sadness lted and she looked at the trees.“You’re still here,” she said quietly to the rustling branches, “and you’re still sharing your apples with everyone.”"},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-author-creates-special-books-grandchildren","story":"Alex Brown, , is celebrating the self-publication via Class Moustache Publishing of the tales of

fall asleep and that Snoozlewhoosh takes them on amazing journeys in the magical world of dreams.”He was advised to trademark Snoozlewhoosh by a friend in the publishing industry, who said the character sounded like something Roald Dahl might have created.Mr Brown said: “Hearing this made me smile and I began to believe I could write and create a book for each grandchild at the very

On the No side, what changes are on offer to preserve the Union – devo max  Federalism  Whats the dference  What does it mean  How will the Celtic nations cope with a south-east of England-dominated, dominant England At least a fully informed referendum decision will give us the faint hope of subsequently being able to vote meaningfully for better governance than we are getting from either Holyrood or Westminster now. We, the electorate, are not stupid and last time I checked it was still our countryJohn Murdoch, Innellan.* ALASDAIR Gallowayasks why those of us who do not support Scottish independence do not place the same burden of proof on our case as we demand from nationalists.The answer is quite simple: the nationalist proposal is a hypothetical projection, while the status quo is an observable reality. We can see and record what happens and what has happened in the UK as it is , but it is up to the nationalists to show that independence would be better, and how that could come about. There is currently no proposal for independence on the table, so it is quite legitimate to ask for one so that it can be scrutinised accordingly.He also asks why any future proposal that may be produced should be subject to a higher level of electoral approval than in  or . Obviously he sees the Brexit vote as great success, but I think we should look to other countries like the United States, where two-thirds is the required vote for constitutional amendments, or to Switzerland, where they require a majority of all cantonsA simple  per cent + victory does not fulfil the purpose of a referendumbut makes underlying isions more permanent and more bitter.Mr Galloway cites domestic precedents in his defence of a simple majority in these matters. However, unIike him, I do not believe that the British way is always the best way of doing things, especially in constitutional matters.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.NO MORE BRANCH MANAGERSMARK Openshawdetails the many steps available in a free society to bring a recalcitrant politician to heel or justice, in this case the Prime Minister of the UK. This is true of all democracies which have evolved over hundreds of years. Democracy as we understand it today is underpinned by the rule of law and in Scotland the legal system can be traced back to the th century, perhaps slightly older than the English legal system. There are many countries able to trace their democratic roots back in time, although Mr Openshaw appears to allude to real democracy being the preserve of “our islands”.If Scotland became independent, it is clear Mr Openshaw would not be supporting the SNP because of its “omerta-like intolerance of internal dissent”. I think the dictionary definition of omerta might be better applied to the governing party at Westminster with all its alleged dubious contracts to “friends” during the Covid crisis.Mr Openshaw need not worry needlessly about who to vote for in an independent Scotland as he will be able to choose from a number of political parties. These are sure to include existing political parties now independent themselves. With the constitutional question having been settled, from a currently bare cupboard the Conservative and Labour parties might be able to come up with a policy or two which would benefit the new Scotland – they might even get elected as the governing party.No longer would the Tory leader in Scotland be regarded as a Tory “lightweight” by his betters in London or the Scottish Labour leader as a “branch manager” for a single MP sitting in London. What’s not to like Alan M Morris, Blanefield.NATURAL REACTION TO EMPIRE BUILDERSALEXANDER R McKays obsessive hatred of national independencequalies him to join the company of many celebrated figures from history.The Romans viciously suppressed independence movements, the Habsburgs and the Romanovs were angered by them, Napoleon hated them and the British regarded them with indignation. The Ottomans failed to understand them and the Nazis ruthlessly attacked them in France, Belgium, Holland, Greece, Norway, Denmark and any of the other countries they invaded.All these frenzied empire builders have been swept aside by history and independent nations have became the accepted normal.As soon as people began to question the morality of empire building and international plundering, residual sympathisers went on the defensive and, by a spectacular inversion of the truth, condemned \"nationalism\" or \"separatism\" as the cause of all political problems. Any examination of history shows that, on the contrary, the pursuit of national independence is just a natural reaction to the arrogant greed of empire builders and conquerors. They all eventually discover its power but cause incalculable damage before they do.Peter M Dryburgh, Edinburgh.* REBECCA McQuillandisplays the head-in-the-sand affliction widely demonstrated by journalists and commentators who do not seem to understand the dference between the terms nationalism and nationality.She accepts the increasingly obvious fact that the UK Conservative Party is now an alien force in Scotland and that the Labour Party in Scotland is severely hampered by its stubborn unionist stance but continues to maintain that there is virtue in avoiding \"separation\" from England. Eventhe bitter pill of Brexit were to be swallowed without complaint, federalism or devo max, both of which would continue to treat Scotland as a region rather than a nation, will never satisfy the aspirations of the emerging generation among which so many identy their nationality as Scottish rather than British their voting choices are driven by nationality rather than nationalism.I dont think I am better than any of my neighbours and dont want to be any more separated from them than at present but I dont want them to be in control of my home as well as their own.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.DOUBLE STANDARDS FROM GOVEMICHAEL Gove expresses laudable sentiments in Friday’s Herald such as \"government is a team event\" and he boasts of new arrangements that \"put mutual respect and collaboration at the heart of a new, mature partnership .What does he mean then when he contrasts the locations of London and Elgin and those who live there  Does one’s location confer superiority  How can we level upthe really important place to be is London  Could it be that this mindset is so thoroughly ingrained, ministers don’t even recognise it in themselves Doesn’t bode well for the future.Jane Guz, Dundee.POVERTY MUST BE THE NEXT FIGHTI SUGGEST that post-pandemic we will have an opportunity to raise our aspirations beyond a pitul “ to normal”, a “normal” which fails to present a particularly hopeful future for so many, at home and abroad.Is it realistic to hope that signicant numbers within our society will recognise and condemn at long last the structural injustices of ultra-free markets in which only the prosperous and relatively prosperous can thrive while so many others struggle even to survive I am confident that the Labour Party will give the poor more hope of a much better “normal” than would the Conservative Party. I base my confidence on the following statement by Sir Keir Starmer: “I have always been motivated by a burning desire to tackle inequality and injustice, to stand up for the powerless against the powerful. If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right.” Can any reader imagine any Conservatives, other than the handful of remaining One Nation Conservatives, saying that since the advent of Margaret Thatcher  years ago Even during the Thatcherite-tinged New Labour years foreign aid was doubled and more than a million pensioners and more than a million children were lted out of absolute poverty.I await to hear the SNP’s approach in its prospectus for an independent Scotland. How far down the social justice path would it wish to lead us  Can it demonstrate that the finances will allow it  Or would a Labour UK government and an enhanced devolution settlement be the answer John Milne, Uddingston."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scottish-governments-plans-reform-regulation-legal-profession-must-resisted","story":"Might the judges have been influenced by the degree of respect which the Scottish Government displayed for the legal profession and the legal process in general following events of about a year ago  That was when the Scottish Government was forced to publish the advice it had received from its own legal counsel. That advice stated that the Scottish Government had furnished information which was  and untruthful in the course of litigation with a former First Minister. The consequence of the uncovering of that  and untruthful evidence were that the Scottish Government immediately had to concede the legal proceedings at a cost to the taxpayer of approximately £ million. One might expect that the Scottish Government would be better served by the legal process in the futurethe regulation of the legal profession were brought under the Government’s own control and the judiciary excluded from that . That would better enable the Scottish Government to furnish evidence in future litigation calculated to achieve the justice that it wanted, rather than the justice which it deserved.The period of public consultation upon these measures has now closed but most people were probably unaware of it in any case and those with an interest in the future of Scottish justice should now request the Scottish Government to bin the proposed reforms and the Scottish Parliament to reject themthe Scottish Government were to seek to legislate upon them.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.* MAY I sincerely wish Lord Carloway every success in his opposition to the Scottish Government’s plans to reformthe Scottish legal system.I will not waste your space or my time by listing the disasters that have been inflicted on other key institutions, all of which are essential to the wellbeing of a free society, by a set of politicians who are hell-bent on central control, thus weakening the democratic process.Dan Edgar, Rothesay.MAKE OUR ROADS LESS HOSTILEOF all the complaints that Lisella Huttonmakes about cyclists, only the failure to wear hi-viz is not already illegal. What we are lacking is enforcement.I would note, though, that the majority of pavement cyclists I see tend to be slow and careful round pedestrians – probably because the cyclist will come off just as badly as,not worse than, the pedestrian in the event of a collision. Which isnt to say that they are not an annoying nuisance but, given the way some drivers behave, I can understand them feeling safer on the pavement.As for hi-viz, what use is it on the pavement  For cyclists on the road, ious studies have shown that hi-viz makes no dference as far as driver behaviour is concerned, though good lights are an absolute requirement at night. Similarly, the effectiveness of cycle helmets in a crash is at best questionable. One famous study even showed that drivers passed helmeted cyclists more closely than they passed non-helmeted cyclists.The answer to the problem lies in making the roads less hostile with lower speed limits and more segregated cycling facilities – which might even get some people out of their cars and onto their bikes.Boyd Johnston, Paisley.SYMPATHY FOR ANDREWS FAMILYTHERE has been extensive speculation concerning the consequences of the recent developments in relation to the civil lawsuit brought against Prince Andrew by Virginia Giuffre in the United States . That speculation has covered in detail such aspects as the long-term effects on the future stability of the monarchy, the loss of status sustained by the Prince, how the defence of the litigation can be sustained financially, the dficulties associated with the Prince ever seeking to settle the action given his repeated statements asserting his innocence, and his disastrous misjudgement in the first place in getting so close to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.In the face of that barrage of publicity, one is left wondering from a human point of view, rather than a state or institutional one: what is the Queen, as an elderly mother, actually making of this furore surrounding Prince Andrew, often referred to as her favourite son, particularly in the year of her Platinum Jubilee  And how are his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, endeavouring to cope with this tsunami of awful news engulfing their father  One is not likely to get answers to these questions. However , I am sure that many will be sympathetic to their positions.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.* WITH Burns Night coming up – and in connection with the Duke of York shedding his HRH – it seems appropriate to recall the poem A Man’s a Man for A That. It has the memorable line regarding titles that \"the rank is but the guineas stamp\".Prince Charles, we hear, is talking about a \"slimmed-down monarchy\".

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC. However, there has been no lack of discussions over the years. What we need to see is agreement reached, procurement started and vessels delivered.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I won’t go back on these  rumours and I sincerely hope that our team will go as far as possible.” vw,vw,px, px\"Aubameyang did not feature for Arsenal in the five games leading up to his departure to Cameroon Midfielder Lemina also took to social media to address the issue, saying on his Instagram Stories: “I’m not even going to feed lies that seek to harm.

That’s where we’re at.”A statement released by the Clarets and the Premier League on Monday evening read: “The Premier League board accepted Burnley’s application with the club having fewer than the required number of players available for the match , due to ongoing Covid- cases, injuries, and representation at the Africa Cup of Nations.”Burnley sent their apologies to both sets of supporters, with the Premier League also apologising for the “inconvenience and disruption” caused by the match “regrettably” being called off.Premier League guidance says clubs should have a minimum of  outfield players and one goalkeeper available for a match to go ahead, though applications for postponements can also be accepted under other circumstances.Dyche had spoken on Monday afternoon about the decision to put in the application to postpone the game.He said: “We know over the last few weeks how clear the Premier League has been on the whys and wherefores and the level it needs to get to. We’ve put the application in in good faith. It’s only three days on from a game that was called off…“We’ve worked really hard to get games on when we’ve been stretched but it’s just too far below the threshold.”Askedthe postponement request could have been lodged earlier, Dyche said the club had waited for the results of Monday morning’s tests before making a call. vw,vw,px, px\"Sean Dyche, who missed Burnley’s last match due to isolation, said the club were in a worse position than before the Leicester match was called off In a statement, Burnley had said their application for postponement was made due to a “high number of injuries and Covid- cases within the squad”.Some managers have questioned whether clubs were taking advantage of the current rules to avoid playing while dealing with y injury lists.Dyche did not reveal how many of his players have Covid-, but said the situation can be more complicated than raw numbers indicate.“There’s a mix of all of that,” he said. “There are some double bubbles as well. Johannis injured and has Covid.“In the Premier League you need two clear days of training but players might have only been back for one day. That’s no use when you’ve had seven or  days in isolation doing very little. vw,vw,px, px\"An injury to Charlie Taylor has added to Burnley’s problems “There’s a mix of what’s going on and it stretches you to the limit.”Saturday was the fourth time this season Burnley had a matched called off due to cases of Covid-, but the first time the request had come from the Turf Moor club.Tuesday’s fixture against Watford had already been rearranged – it was originally due to be played on December  but was postponed due to positive cases within the Hornets camp.Burnley last played on January , when they were without seven players for the - FA Cup loss to Championship side Huddersfield – a match which was also missed by Dyche and coach Steve Stone following positive tests.Since then, the Clarets have lost Chris Wood in a surprise transfer to Newcastle – forced on Burnley due to a release clause in the New Zealand striker’s contract – while Ivory Coast international Maxwel Cornet is at the Africa Cup of Nations. vw,vw,px, px\"Chris Wood made his Newcastle debut on Saturday Dyche’s side have played only  Premier League games, the fewest of any team, and sit bottom of the table after Saturday’s results, three points shy of th-placed Watford.In addition to the Watford match, Burnley’s fixtures against Everton and Aston Villa were postponed last month, while they must still reschedule November’s match against Tottenham, which was called off at short notice due to heavy snow.A total of  Premier League games have been postponed this term due to coronavirus cases.On Monday, the Premier League said that, of , Covid- tests administered on players and staff last week,  came back positive, down from  for the week of January -, and  for the week of December  to January .We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The PM waved it aside,” Mr Cummings wrote in his blog.He added: “The events of May  alone, never mind the string of other events, mean the PM lied to Parliament about parties.“Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened.”In response a No  spokesman said Mr Johnson had apologised to the House and that he “believed implicitly” that he had been attending a work event.“It is untrue that the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance,” the spokesman said, adding Mr Johnson would be making a further statement when Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating partying in Whitehall during lockdown, has completed her inquiry. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson told MPs he believed he was at a work event The allegations will potentially add to the pressure on Mr Johnson, who is facing calls to resign from some Tory MPs amid widespread voter anger at reports that Covid rules were flouted by No .Allies of the Prime Minister have been mounting a fightback, dubbed operation red meat, with a series of populist policies, freezing the TV licence and putting the Royal Navy in charge of operations to prevent migrant boats crossing the Channel in an attempt to regain support.Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson did not need to wait for Ms Gray’s report and called on him to step down.“Boris Johnson was warned that the party on May   was breaking the rules and yet he not only dismissed those concerns, but attended himself,” she said.“Instead of hiding behind internal inquiries or technicalities, we need the Prime Minister to tell the truth pure and simple.“Boris Johnson has failed to show leadership and it’s the British public who have suffered.“He must resign.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It could include an exemption for smaller levels of saving.”The committee added that automatic appointments with Pension Wise should be trialled, to help support people to make better decisions.There should be one appointment when a person accesses their pension for the first time and also one at the age of , before they can access their pension savings, the committee suggested.The pension freedoms, introduced in , give people a much wider range of choices over what to do with their pension, rather than being required to buy a retirement annuity.The Committee said that, although Pension Wise offers a good service, not enough people use it.During an inquiry, the Committee was told by the Financial Conduct Authoritythat consumers describe pensions as a “minefield”, with even those who felt financially confident in other aspects of their lives struggling to understand how pensions work.Stephen Timms, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said the pensions landscape “is in a constant state of change”.He said: “It’s little wonder therefore that – as the Government’s own financial regulator recognises – people struggle to navigate the pensions minefield.“When the  reforms were introduced, the Government guaranteed that savers would be given the tools they needed to take advantage of the new range of options and make well-informed decisions. Seven years on, guidance remains the missing piece of the pension freedoms jigsaw.“Nudging savers will not be enough. The Government and regulators can no longer just sit on their hands as decision making becomes ever more complicated.“They must end their timidity and be much more active in supporting people as they approach retirement. We know that those who use Pension Wise find it useful and often make dferent choices as a result. Every effort should be made to boost its use.“Without intervention to drive up dramatically the numbers receiving advice and guidance, savers will make poor decisions – and, in far too many cases, become scam victims – and the pension freedoms, far from living up to their name, will instead trap people in an increasingly confusing web of complexity.”The FCA should look to increase the number of people choosing a mixture of retirement products which could benefit them, the report suggested.For example, someone may benefit from withdrawing a lump sum when they first access their pension and at a later stage in their le choose an annuity, which guarantees an income.The pensions advice allowance, which allows £ to be withdrawn from a pension up to three times in dferent tax years for advice, should also be overhauled with the annual limit removed and the Money and Pensions Service and advisers encouraged to signpost its use, it said.Commenting on the report, Phil Brown, director of policy at BCE, provider of the People’s Pension, said: “More must be done to help savers understand risks such as longevity and inflation, as well as how investments work.“Although Pension Wise is a very good service, it isn’t the only solution to this problem and providers need to develop products which will help retirees safely spend their money, while optimising the way they continue to save during retirement.”Laura Myers, a partner at financial consultancy LCPsaid: “For many savers the most attractive feature of saving in a pension is the ability to take % of the pension pot in the form of tax-free cash.“The problem is that far too little attention is given to what happens to the other %.“This can end up in a poor value drawdown product or, worse still, be fully withdrawn and sit in a current account or cash Isa with ultra-low s.”Baroness Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, said: “Helping more people understand pensions and making them work better through retirement can also help improve the reputation of pensions, encourage more people to leave their money invested for longer and ultimately have more money in later le, rather than rushing to take out money as soon as they can and possibly paying unnecessary tax.”Yvonne Braun, director of long-term savings at the Association of British Insurerssaid: “Decisions about accessing a pension are some of the most complex financial decisions people make in their letime, and many savers will be unsure of the best course of action.”A Department for Work and Pensionsspokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring people have the support and information they need to make informed choices about their financial futures, striking the right balance between providing vital protections and informing pension savers, while also giving them freedom and choice about how to use their hard-earned pension savings.“Our stronger nudge measures will require pension scheme trustees to offer to book a Pension Wise appointment for a saver, unless they actively decide to opt out of receiving guidance through a separate communication.“Since November, our new transfer regulations have bolstered protections for savers by empowering trustees and scheme managers to halt a transfer request where they suspect it could end up in the hands of a fraudster.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The administrators disagree.“Further, as those claims are not yet determined the administrators and bidders have no clarity on the size of anyliability. That has implications for exiting administration, and ultimately the club being able to retain itsmembership status.”The EFL said Derby consider the claims to be “spurious”, but the current bidders “appear unwilling to assume the risk of defending them”.The clubs joint administrators have released a statement this evening 👇#DCFC #dcfcfans— Derby CountyJanuary , Middlesbrough and Wycombe are concerned their rights will be adversely affectedDerby can “extinguish or compromise the claims” using the insolvency process, the EFL said.“The EFL is keen to try and resolve the current impasse.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

The experts aren’t sure what’s wrong with me. They believe it may be post traumatic epilepsy linked to the accident.“My sister told me that as soon as I came round after the accident I started having seizures. I was seizuring in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, whatever way I hit my head.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “The medics told me I was lucky to be alive. They said a lot of people with my type of bleed on the brain don’t survive so I feel very lucky. EvenI do have epilepsy, I’m glad that’s all I have.”Karmen was just  when she hit a pothole while riding an e-scooter and was thrown over the front of it.After being rushed to UCLA Hospital in Los Angeles, she spent nearly three weeks in intensive care, after being diagnosed with a bleed on the brain. She also suffered a broken collarbone, nose and eye orbital bone.The young woman, who now lives in Ballyclare, said she doesn’t want to see e-scooters legalised.“E-scooters are so dangerous, I definitely don’t want to see them on public roads,” she said.“I see so many kids on them now. I keep thinking I would hate for my child to come off one of them and die. You would just blame yourself for letting them on it.”The accident happened after she travelled to the US to visit her sister Sian, a student at Southern Connecticut State University.The sisters had planned a trip around the west coast of Calornia for two weeks with Sian’s university friends before ing home.Disaster struck, however, when the group decided to rent electric scooters during a day out in Los Angeles.“Obviously when we hired out e-scooters we thought they looked great and it would be an easy way to get about,” she recalled.“You don’t think about the fact thatyou fall off one of them you’re toast.“Nobody showed us how to use one. We downloaded an app and scanned the e-scooter. Simple.“They’re everywhere in America. People travel all over the place on them. It’s probably more common to have accidents there.”Shop worker Karmen said she doesn’t “remember much about” the day of the accident in May .“It was the last day of the holiday,” she said.“We were going home the next morning. We thought we’d gone down to the beach on the e-scooters and… then I ended up in hospital for nearly three weeks.”Her sister Sian launched a fundraising campaign to help with medical bills. Karmen hadn’t taken out travel insurance before the trip. and the treatment cost more than ,a day due to the seriousness of her injuries. “Every time I woke up in hospital I couldn’t remember where I was,” said Karmen.“The accident definitely affected my memory — it’s still not the best.“But I can’t complain. I’m very lucky to be here.”Karmen said it’s distressing when she sees “kids going about on them all the time” near her home.“Nobody seems to thinks about health and safety,” she said.“One of my friends has an e-scooter. I’ve warned him about the dangers and he replied that he’d put his hood up… but you can’t make people listen to youthey don’t want to. “At the very least they should get helmets.”She added: “If you fall off a bike you’ll probably come off the side more than you will flip over the front. I flipped right over the front of the e-scooter.”Dad Frank , a car salesman, is still dealing with the cost of the accident, according to Karmen whose mother Karensuffered an aneurysm and died the year before the accident. The family also tragically lost Karmen’s brother Saul in a car accident in .UUP peer Lord Rogan, who is campaigning against e-scooters, said Karmen’s accident illustrates how e-scooters are “missiles with handlebars”.“Karmen has endured a horrendous ordeal and I am sorry to learn that she continues to suffer from her injuries two and a half years after the terrying accident,” he said.“She knows better than anyone just how dangerous e-scooters are and how much damage they can inflict. They must not be allowed on public roads — not now, not ever.”Lord Rogan urged the PSNI to “prosecute iniduals caught riding these wretched machines on our streets”.“As Karmen can testy, they have the potential to destroy and even end the lives both of riders and members of the public simply going about their everyday business,” he said.“Given their growing popularity, despite the ban, I would also encourage the Northern Ireland Executive to launch a public awareness campaign to highlight the dangers e-scooters pose.“Such a campaign should begin in schools, perhaps led by the PSNI, so our young people understand at any early age that e-scooters are bad news.”He added: “I will continue to raise these matters in the House of Lords and again commend the Belfastfor drawing attention to the scourge of these missiles with handlebars.”Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days Suzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson’s latest move could prove to be his undoing‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeRocker on acid trip thought Orange band was giant slugTop VideosPlayPowerful moment Michelle O#Neill reads list of names of  murdered womenPlayTsunami waves crash across shore as undersea volcano erupts near TongaPlayNorthern Ireland political leaders hold vigil for Ashling MurphyLatest Northern IrelandJay Donnelly wins battle of the old boys to seal victory for Glentoran against CltonvillePerfect crisp winter days but sub zero nights aheadPSNI dished out  Covid fines on day No held a partyBelfast City Council voices opposition to closure of Regina Coeli Women#s HostelLisa SmythOpinionIf Omicron goes, we can be cautiously optimisticLatestFuneral of Ashling Murphy to take place todayEA: Firms behind worst pollution cases should face ‘much tougher punishment’Nicola Sturgeon to revealcoronavirus restrictions will be relaxed furtherJay Blades says reading words is ‘like having a book of ants’Will Smith dances with his mother to celebrate her th birthday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s always so hot in Barcelona.“I love the pure air and smell of nature when I’m back there.“The days were longer because the sun rises really early and sets really late. We loved visiting family and exploring the countryside.”Surely he was worried about asking someone to insert something into his head several years ago “The surgeon was a professional — and of course I knew what he was implanting because I created it myself,” he said.“But while he was drilling into my head I had some moments of doubt!”Humans normally hear using air conduction with sound waves passing through the outer and middle ears and causing the inner eardrum to vibrate.But with the bone conduction technique modied by Neil, the vibrations are transmitted through the skull or jawbone directly to the inner ear.As for meeting and working with celebrities, he explained: “I’ve been giving talks about this type of art and creating ‘sound portraits’.“I get close to someone’s face and I pick up the vibrations of the colours of someone’s face.”“Sometimes I’d be in the same space of a well-known person and would askI could do a sound portrait, or sometimes they’d ask me.”With Covid still rampant and the pandemic ongoing, Neil said he isn’t sure when he’ll next be able tohome.But, as another cyborg famously promised in The Terminator: “I’ll be back...”Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days Suzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson’s latest move could prove to be his undoing‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeRocker on acid trip thought Orange band was giant slugTop VideosPlayPowerful moment Michelle O#Neill reads list of names of  murdered womenPlayTsunami waves crash across shore as undersea volcano erupts near TongaPlayNorthern Ireland political leaders hold vigil for Ashling MurphyLatest Northern IrelandJay Donnelly wins battle of the old boys to seal victory for Glentoran against CltonvillePerfect crisp winter days but sub zero nights aheadPSNI dished out  Covid fines on day No held a partyBelfast City Council voices opposition to closure of Regina Coeli Women#s HostelLisa SmythOpinionIf Omicron goes, we can be cautiously optimisticLatestWill Smith dances with his mother to celebrate her th birthdayPeers maul Government protest crackdown setting stage for stand-offBetty White’s assistant shares new photo of late actress on her th birthdayBritish musician Hazel O’Connor recovering following ‘serious medical event’EFL working to resolve Derby County’s administration ‘impasse’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last November, reports emerged that the hostel would close by Spring, leaving staff and residents uncertain of their future.Read MoreWorkers stage protest over plans to close Belfast’s only homeless hostel for womenLast week, workers occupied the facility in a   work-in protest after being told their jobs would end in February. Staff involved in the protest were subsequently suspended, with the trade union Unite saying its members received letters from the management suspending for alleged serious breaches of the safety and security of residents.A special council meeting was called to order on Monday in order to debate a motion calling for stakeholders to meet to discuss the hostel’s planned closure and how to secure its future.The motion was tabled by SDLP councillor Paul McCusker and seconded by People Before Profit’s Fiona Ferguson. Sinn Fein also tabled an amendment, highlighting the need for the Legion of Mary to step in and help find a solution to the closure, which was accepted by Mr McCusker.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Members were given a presentation by two workers at Regina Coeli, who highlighted the importance of ensuring the continuation of the service. Emma McCann has been a support worker at the hostel for the past five years.My job, and that of my colleagues, in supporting these women is one we are committed to, she said.To see women grow stronger and to rebuild their confidence to go back into society after the horrors they have suffered is truly inspiring. The hostel provides a calm and safe environment for the women we support and this is vital as they recover from the traumas they have experienced before coming to Regina Coeli. Trauma such as domestic abuse, addiction, mental health and complex needs.At a time when we are seeing a sharp rise in domestic abuse and femicide, where the majority of victims will know their abusers, we should be looking to increase the number of women#s hostels and invest in the services they provide – not shut them down.Mr McCusker said staff at the hostel go above and beyond in order to support the women at the facility and there is a rising number of women presenting as homeless, highlighting the need for such facilities.We need the council to say #we can#t allow this service to close#... we can#t sit by and see homeless women not getting the support they need, he said.The amended motion was passed by councillors, without a vote.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilSDLPPeople Before ProfitSinn FéinMore On Belfast City CouncilRegister for animal cruelty offenders is a step closer, says Poots PremiumJust one Orange lodge awarded grant from £m heritage fund PremiumViewpointOpinionIt’s worth travelling along green routeBelfast councillors to discuss motion on free public transport for young people PremiumUnder strain: Six key areas where Covid staff shortages are affecting essential servicesMost ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days Suzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson’s latest move could prove to be his undoing‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeRocker on acid trip thought Orange band was giant slugTop VideosPlayPowerful moment Michelle O#Neill reads list of names of  murdered womenPlayTsunami waves crash across shore as undersea volcano erupts near TongaPlayNorthern Ireland political leaders hold vigil for Ashling MurphyLatest Northern IrelandJay Donnelly wins battle of the old boys to seal victory for Glentoran against CltonvillePerfect crisp winter days but sub zero nights aheadPSNI dished out  Covid fines on day No held a partyLisa SmythOpinionIf Omicron goes, we can be cautiously optimisticPipe bomb sparks security alert in Co AntrimLatestFuneral of Ashling Murphy to take place todayEA: Firms behind worst pollution cases should face ‘much tougher punishment’Nicola Sturgeon to revealcoronavirus restrictions will be relaxed furtherJay Blades says reading words is ‘like having a book of ants’Will Smith dances with his mother to celebrate her th birthday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePaul Givan and Robbie Butler MLA during the vigil.Claire McNeillyTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFirst Minister Paul Givan has not joined the Presbyterian Church, according to the DUP.Mr Givan, who resigned from the Free Presbyterian Church late last year, was pictured at a vigil for murdered Co Offaly woman Asling Murphy at First Lisburn Presbyterian Church on Sunday evening.His appearance at the event, which was organised by Alliance MLA Sorcha Eastwood, gave rise to speculation that Mr Givan had joined the church.But a DUP spokesman told the Belfastthat Mr Givan was just in attendance as a local MLA.Although the First Minister parted company with the Free Presbyterian Church in November , he has never officially confirmed his resignation.A retired leading minister from the church that the late DUP leader Ian Paisley founded claimed at the time that he had been made aware that the Lagan Valley Assembly man had left following a dispute over his attendance at the cross-community Northern Ireland centenary service in Armagh.Rev Ivan Foster, a one-time prominent member of the DUP, said Mr Givan had tendered his resignation after speaking to Free Presbyterian Church elders in Lisburn.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Givan had been criticised by church members for his attendance at the ecumenical service last October.When approached about the resignation, he would neither confirm nor deny it had happened, adding that it was “an issue that I don’t intend to make public commentary about”.At the time, the DUP said the matter of Mr Givan’s religion was a private one for him.In an interview with BBC Radio Ulster last year, Mr Givan said: “This is, for me, an issue where first and foremost, I regard the Gospel as being of fundamental importance.“My own personal circumstances are secondary to that.“I would never want to say anything in a public way that would diminish that Gospel witness.”Mr Givan has stood by his decision to attend the centenary event.“When the invitation came in it was obviously something I considered, and I took the view that it was appropriate for me, as First Minister, to attend,” he said.Mr Givan’s resignation means that there are now fewer than  DUP MLAs who call themselves Free Presbyterians.Although the church and Northern Ireland’s biggest political party were never officially linked, most of the early DUP members were from a Free Presbyterian backgroundIn recent years, however, the two bodies have grown apart.The first major schism came when Mr Paisley opted to become Northern Ireland First Minister and enter a devolved government with Sinn Fein.The church handed Rev Paisley an ultimatum of either renouncing his position as First Minister or quitting his role as moderator, which he had held for  years.Rev Paisley chose politics and served as First Minister alongside the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein as Deputy First Minister.The Free Presbyterian Church was also highly critical of the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as an Antrim and Newtownabbey council candidate, in .In a statement about Ms Bennington, the church said that it “underlines its opposition to all martial and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church, we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of scripture.”Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender. We must abide by the rules in order we can bring the pandemic to an end as quickly as possible. There is no other way and we have to remain as safe as possible, he remarked.ldquoI fully appreciate the damage which the pandemic has done to the local economy and I fear that there could be job losses in .ldquoThe business community in Downpatrick and surrounding towns and villages needs help.

It was stated in the original prospectus that motor racing was one of three things which would be looking upon favourably, he explained.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The business community in Ballynahinch has been challenged to press forward with a development plan to take the town into the next century.The challenge made this week by South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, who appealed to local traders to lead the way in the commercial regeneration of the town.Addressing Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce on Monday night, Mr McGrady said it as up to the townrsquos business community to take the initiative and put together a package of measures which would be eligible for substantial grant aid.He told members: ldquoI will try to help in any way I can, but the major thrust of any regeneration of Ballynahinch must come from the people in this room.The SDLP MP said the town must take advantage of ious grant-aided programmes, such as the Department of Environmentrsquos urban development and environmental improvement schemes, which could be used to improve either inidual premises or sections of the town.NEWCASTLE ndash Newcastle Chamber of Commerce has defended its decision to erect just a few Christmas decorations in the town.Fteen illuminated figures were erected along Main Street before Christmas but at the monthly Chamber meeting several traders expressed dissatisfaction at the decorations.Some said the figures were too small and poorly illuminate while others said they looked insignicant when compared with those in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch.However, Chamber President, Mr Peter Law, defended the decorations, saying it was all the group could afford at the time.ldquoThe figures which we purchased cost pound, and there were additional expenses incurred in having them erected, so it was felt we would be better staying within our budge rather than over-reaching ourselves, he said.ldquoI do not think the Chamber would stay in existence very longwe had gone ahead and spent several thousand pounds and later approached the business community for the money, he added.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man who waded chest high in the flooded Moneycarragh River to save the lives of nine sheep is the toast of local farmers.Mr Philip Connor, , De Courcey Way was out exercising his dogs in the afternoon of New Yearrsquos Eve when his attention was drawn to the nearby river by raised voices.Seeing the plight of sheep struggling in the deep water, he raced home to lock up the dogs, which he reckoned would become a nuisance, and came back with a rope to begin a rescue bid as darkness fell.Believing they might have been owned by neighbouring farmer Wilbert Hassard, he had him contracted.He had been told that about a dozen sheep had been driven into the river by two collies. Some of them had become entangled with barbed wire as they crashed through fencing.He described the next half-hour alone in the cold, swirling flood waters as ldquosome wrestling match. But he could not have gone home knowing that they were fighting for their lives.Without his trousers on, but wearing wellington boots to protect his feet, he had to lt some of the trapped animals over two banks to safety.DOWNPATRICK ndash A Downpatrick social club faces the risk of closure following objections to the renewal of its licence.The RUC has formally objected to the renewal of the drinks licence for the Saul Street Social Club.It is understood to be the first objection by police in Down District to a club licence renewal since the new, stronger Registration of Clubs legislation came into force in February .Licence applications for a number of Downrsquos  other licences clubs were formally approve at Downpatrick Magistratesrsquo Court on Thursday.However, when the application by the Saul Street Club was formally called, police lodged an objection.

So two for Northern Ireland would do the job.Note NI already uses nuclear generated electricity. Electricity is pumped undersea from Scotland to Moyle, Co Antrim by the Moyle Interconnector. So some of this electricity will be Scottish nuclear power generated on Scottish soil. A fact those in NI who oppose nuclear energy plants on NI soil must put in their pipe and smoke.And Northern Ireland holiday home owners in Donegal will be using French nuclear energy. The new undersea Celtic Connector links France to the Cork coast. France generates % of its power from nuclear.RR’s world class nuclear energy scientists are confident of strong demand worldwide for their mighty mini nuclear energy stations. Even Republic of Irelandmight buy one by repealing prohibition of nuclear energy generation on Irish soil.Importing nuclear energy from French soil — enough to power half a million homes — to  counties soil has undermined this prohibition position. The EU move just before Christmas to rebrand nuclear energy green is a further blow to continuing RoI prohibition.It seems therefore, North and South, a coach and four is driving through the no nuclear energy stations on our soil argument.So in the May elections I will be asking Foyle constituency candidates what’s their vision, for Derry and Belfast, becoming part of the fast emerging new mighty mini nuclear energy age.My vision ismini nuclear stations generate cheaper electricity up ahead it means no six o’clock folk — those who can only afford energy at tea time in the middle of winter — then we must build them.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

That’s where we’re at.”A statement released by the Clarets and the Premier League on Monday evening read: “The Premier League board accepted Burnley’s application with the club having fewer than the required number of players available for the match , due to ongoing Covid- cases, injuries, and representation at the Africa Cup of Nations.”Burnley sent their apologies to both sets of supporters, with the Premier League also apologising for the “inconvenience and disruption” caused by the match “regrettably” being called off.Premier League guidance says clubs should have a minimum of  outfield players and one goalkeeper available for a match to go ahead, though applications for postponements can also be accepted under other circumstances.Dyche had spoken on Monday afternoon about the decision to put in the application to postpone the game.He said: “We know over the last few weeks how clear the Premier League has been on the whys and wherefores and the level it needs to get to. We’ve put the application in in good faith.

Johannis injured and has Covid.“In the Premier League you need two clear days of training but players might have only been back for one day. That’s no use when you’ve had seven or  days in isolation doing very little. vw,vw,px, px\"An injury to Charlie Taylor has added to Burnley’s problems “There’s a mix of what’s going on and it stretches you to the limit.”Saturday was the fourth time this season Burnley had a matched called off due to cases of Covid-, but the first time the request had come from the Turf Moor club.Tuesday’s fixture against Watford had already been rearranged – it was originally due to be played on December  but was postponed due to positive cases within the Hornets camp.Burnley last played on January , when they were without seven players for the - FA Cup loss to Championship side Huddersfield – a match which was also missed by Dyche and coach Steve Stone following positive tests.Since then, the Clarets have lost Chris Wood in a surprise transfer to Newcastle – forced on Burnley due to a release clause in the New Zealand striker’s contract – while Ivory Coast international Maxwel Cornet is at the Africa Cup of Nations. vw,vw,px, px\"Chris Wood made his Newcastle debut on Saturday Dyche’s side have played only  Premier League games, the fewest of any team, and sit bottom of the table after Saturday’s results, three points shy of th-placed Watford.In addition to the Watford match, Burnley’s fixtures against Everton and Aston Villa were postponed last month, while they must still reschedule November’s match against Tottenham, which was called off at short notice due to heavy snow.A total of  Premier League games have been postponed this term due to coronavirus cases.On Monday, the Premier League said that, of , Covid- tests administered on players and staff last week,  came back positive, down from  for the week of January -, and  for the week of December  to January ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Burnley us clash with Watford postponed as not enough Clarets players available article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA target should be set of least % of people using Pension Wise or receiving paid-for advice when accessing their pension pots for the first time, the Work and Pensions Committee urged.It said Government and regulators must “end their timidity” to help savers avoid making poor decisions and in some cases ending up as victims of pensions scams.Pension Wise helps people aged  and over to make sense of their options, offering free, impartial guidance.The committee said: “We recommend that the Government sets a goal for the Money and Pensions Service for the combined use of Pension Wise and paid-for advice when accessing pension pots for the first time.“This goal should be at least % and expressed in terms of iniduals rather than pots. It could include an exemption for smaller levels of saving.”The committee added that automatic appointments with Pension Wise should be trialled, to help support people to make better decisions.There should be one appointment when a person accesses their pension for the first time and also one at the age of , before they can access their pension savings, the committee suggested.The pension freedoms, introduced in , give people a much wider range of choices over what to do with their pension, rather than being required to buy a retirement annuity.The Committee said that, although Pension Wise offers a good service, not enough people use it.During an inquiry, the Committee was told by the Financial Conduct Authoritythat consumers describe pensions as a “minefield”, with even those who felt financially confident in other aspects of their lives struggling to understand how pensions work.Stephen Timms, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said the pensions landscape “is in a constant state of change”.He said: “It’s little wonder therefore that – as the Government’s own financial regulator recognises – people struggle to navigate the pensions minefield..remove“When the  reforms were introduced, the Government guaranteed that savers would be given the tools they needed to take advantage of the new range of options and make well-informed decisions. Seven years on, guidance remains the missing piece of the pension freedoms jigsaw.“Nudging savers will not be enough. The Government and regulators can no longer just sit on their hands as decision making becomes ever more complicated.“They must end their timidity and be much more active in supporting people as they approach retirement. We know that those who use Pension Wise find it useful and often make dferent choices as a result. Every effort should be made to boost its use.“Without intervention to drive up dramatically the numbers receiving advice and guidance, savers will make poor decisions – and, in far too many cases, become scam victims – and the pension freedoms, far from living up to their name, will instead trap people in an increasingly confusing web of complexity.”The FCA should look to increase the number of people choosing a mixture of retirement products which could benefit them, the report suggested.For example, someone may benefit from withdrawing a lump sum when they first access their pension and at a later stage in their le choose an annuity, which guarantees an income.The pensions advice allowance, which allows £ to be withdrawn from a pension up to three times in dferent tax years for advice, should also be overhauled with the annual limit removed and the Money and Pensions Service and advisers encouraged to signpost its use, it said.Commenting on the report, Phil Brown, director of policy at BCE, provider of the People’s Pension, said: “More must be done to help savers understand risks such as longevity and inflation, as well as how investments work.“Although Pension Wise is a very good service, it isn’t the only solution to this problem and providers need to develop products which will help retirees safely spend their money, while optimising the way they continue to save during retirement.”Laura Myers, a partner at financial consultancy LCPsaid: “For many savers the most attractive feature of saving in a pension is the ability to take % of the pension pot in the form of tax-free cash.“The problem is that far too little attention is given to what happens to the other %.“This can end up in a poor value drawdown product or, worse still, be fully withdrawn and sit in a current account or cash Isa with ultra-low s.”Baroness Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, said: “Helping more people understand pensions and making them work better through retirement can also help improve the reputation of pensions, encourage more people to leave their money invested for longer and ultimately have more money in later le, rather than rushing to take out money as soon as they can and possibly paying unnecessary tax.”Yvonne Braun, director of long-term savings at the Association of British Insurerssaid: “Decisions about accessing a pension are some of the most complex financial decisions people make in their letime, and many savers will be unsure of the best course of action.”A Department for Work and Pensionsspokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring people have the support and information they need to make informed choices about their financial futures, striking the right balance between providing vital protections and informing pension savers, while also giving them freedom and choice about how to use their hard-earned pension savings.“Our stronger nudge measures will require pension scheme trustees to offer to book a Pension Wise appointment for a saver, unless they actively decide to opt out of receiving guidance through a separate communication.“Since November, our new transfer regulations have bolstered protections for savers by empowering trustees and scheme managers to halt a transfer request where they suspect it could end up in the hands of a fraudster.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Savers need stronger support to navigate pensions minefield, say MPs article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is completely unacceptable that many women face risk and danger when simply going about their lives. Domestic abuse is part of a wider issue of violence against women and girls andwe are to truly deal with this scourge then we need to start having dficult conversations and challenging the misogynistic attitudes that are still all too prevalent across these islands.“Women’s Aid and other support groups that help women and girls do amazing work. Whether it’s through their important training programmes teaching young people about healthy relationships and how to recognise emotional abuse or providing refuge, their tireless volunteers make a real impact on people’s lives.
