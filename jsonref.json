Each intimate encounter leaves her feeling physically and emotionally high, \u0027warm and glowing\u0027, something she puts down to the release of the hormone oxytocin.Janice Hiller supports her theory and agrees a regular sex life brings significant health benefits, for both women and men, by increasing pleasure chemicals and reducing those that cause stress. \u0027During sex our bodies release more oxytocin, the bonding and stress-reducing hormone, and dopamine, which is the reward, pleasure and drive chemical,\u0027 says Janice. \u0027It also reduces levels of the stress chemical, cortisol.\u0027Research on men, has shown that those who have regular orgasms are less likely to have heart attacks. There aren\u0027t really any downsides.\u0027Mismatched libidos were, however, a major issue for Helen Robinson, 56, who ended a long-term relationship a year ago partly due to her partner\u0027s interest in sex waning while her own ardour was undiminished.To avoid a repeat of this, instead of looking for another man her own age, Helen made her first foray into the world of online dating, with the deliberate intention of meeting men in their 30s, and even 20s.         Carol El Hawary, pictured with her husband Atef at their wedding. \u0027We don\u0027t need fluffy handcuffs or different clothes to keep things interesting,\u0027 says Carol. \u0027Sometimes it\u0027s over quickly, and sometimes it\u0027s not. That tends to depend on him and how tired he\u0027s feeling\u0027She believes that they are more likely to have libidos matching her own.The chef, from South London, makes it clear on her dating profile that she is interested in a sexual, not a committed, relationship, and often dates three men at a time, seeing them on different nights.\u0027Ideally I would have sex every day, three times a day when I\u0027m not working,\u0027 says Helen.\u0027When I first met my ex he was very similar to me, but, by the time we separated, I was lucky if he was up for it once a month.\u0027It makes you feel very vulnerable when you want a sexual connection with someone who no longer wants one with you.\u0027Sex is energising and fun — it can be wild, fierce, tender. Being desired is a delicious feeling but I think people wrongly assume that post-menopausal women aren\u0027t interested in sex because most of us moderate our behaviour to fit in with society\u0027s expectations.\u0027The men in my life now know they are not my one and only.\u0027But Helen is keen to stress that climbing into bed is not the only thing she wants to do on a date, many of which begin in an art gallery, or the pub, chatting about literature and cooking.Helen has been seeing one man for ten months, while other couplings have fizzled out, sometimes because the men are looking for a more serious relationship.But what, one wonders, do these young men see in a woman who, while still attractive and in good shape thanks to exercising five times a week, is in her sixth decade?\u0027I realise there\u0027s social stigma around this, so I often ask the men I date: \u0027What\u0027s attractive to you about being with an older woman?\u0027 \u0027 says Helen.\u0027I\u0027m told it\u0027s because fiftysomething women, like me, tend to be more confident about what we want, and are happy to say it, which men find very appealing.\u0027We\u0027re also less hung up on what people think about us.\u0027On the subject of judgment, what do Helen\u0027s friends make of her passion? \u0027Some of them are surprised and ask: \u0027Where do you find the energy?\u0027 \u0027 she says.\u0027I was embarrassed at first to tell them I was dating younger men, but they\u0027ve mostly said: \u0027That\u0027s great.\u0027 \u0027Still, Helen is sure that, ultimately, she will want another monogamous, long-term relationship, probably with someone close to her own age, with whom she is likely to have more in common.However, one thing is certain: next time around, Helen will ensure that, like Hayley and Carol, she settles down with a man whose sexual appetite remains as insatiable as her own.n Is your marriage full of midlife passion?

But bad behaviour isn’t confined to recent decades – a manuscript from 1480, which has been digitised for the first time by the British Library, gives an insight into the antics of medieval children, as it exhorts them to “pyke notte thyne errys nothyr thy nostrellys” – don’t pick your ears or your nostrils - and to “spette not ovyr thy tabylle”.The 15th-century conduct book, The Lytille Childrenes Lytil Boke, was intended to teach table manners. It has been put online as part of a new children’s literature website bringing together original manuscripts, interviews and drafts by authors from Lewis Carroll to Jacqueline Wilson. The medieval text is part of the British Library’s own collection, and “by listing all the many things that medieval children should not do, it also gives us a hint of the mischief they got up to”, said the library.“Bulle not as a bene were in thi throote,” is another piece of advice doled out by the book – or “don’t burp as if you had a bean in your throat”. “And chesse cum by fore the, be not to redy,” children are warned – or “don’t be greedy when they bring out the cheese”. And long predating the Victorian age’s exhortations for children to be seen but not heard: “‘Loke thou laughe not, nor grenne  And with moche speche thou mayste do synne.” Or: “Don’t laugh, grin or talk too much.”Anna Lobbenberg, the lead producer on the British Library’s digital learning programme, said: “These older collection items allow young people to examine the past close up. Some of these sources will seem fascinatingly remote, while others may seem uncannily familiar despite being created hundreds of years ago.” More than 100 “treasures from children’s literature” feature on the new site, Discovering Children’s Books, including pages from Judith Kerr’s sketchbook for The Tiger Who Came to Tea, showing tigers drawn from life at London zoo. Axel Scheffler has shared the changing face of the Gruffalo, after he was told to make it less scary. There is also the first manuscript of Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures Under Ground, which would become Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Enid Blyton’s typescript drafts of The Famous Five and Last Term at Malory Towers.The site, bringing together collections from the British Library, Seven Stories, Bodleian Libraries and the V\u0026ampA, will also feature Curiosities in the Tower of London, a miniature book published in 1741 by Thomas Boreman, the first publisher and bookseller to specialise in books for children. Describing the Royal Menagerie at the Tower of London, the miniature book sees Boreman introduce the zoo’s lionesses, Jenny and Phillis, and the lion Marco with his “frightful teeth”. It will also show children the only book about suffragettes written for children during the Votes for Women campaign, Votes for Catherine Susan and Me by Kathleen Ainslie. Catherine Susan, and Me, are two peg dolls, who join the campaign, fighting policemen, smashing windows, going to prison and going on hunger strike. Perhaps unsurprisingly for the time, the tale was meant to be a cautionary one: “We cheered up when the Home Secretary and the Governor came to see us. And when they said ‘Will you go home quietly’? we said ‘YES’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5a2ead2d39e3d37f1dd82fad0448f0fa2c1898c/0_213_2039_1223/master/2039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=647478d826a85401ad3fbfbff8bd5449","title":"housing property market young rising prices","story":"Entire generations will struggle to be able to afford their own property – the market has failed themLeaflets pile up on my doormat from estate agents. “For sale” signs are erected outside houses on my street. Tarpaulins covering exposed loft conversions blow in the wind. The signs are clear: people are looking for property in my area. I didn’t need a Daily Mail headline to shout at me: “House prices surging in EVERY region.”In the UK, the value of life is measured in house prices, for those lucky enough to own one. To see house-price rises (especially those worth more than £900,000) as a cheery fact is to lack awareness. Rising prices are excluding entire generations from the housing market. See that housing ladder you climbed? Well, here’s the snake.There’s a perversity to the way we compartmentalise issues around property, as if problems are not interconnected. We talk of selfish boomers who bought a house for a fiver, and yet we know that the average wage cannot secure mortgages in some of the UK’s largest cities. We talk of the bedroom tax, council tax, inheritance tax, capital gains and stamp duty as the only possibilities of levelling things out. However, there is a complete absence of understanding about how generations interact. The average purchase now is supposed to be an investment, a pension and even funding for future care. Given the current market, my generation even has to tap into the value of their home to provide deposits for their children.More young adults have to live with their parents for longer, and as a result are having their independence taken away. Some of our children may even have to move away from the places they were born, to escape the precarious rental market.I know exactly what it is like to feel insecure. At one point I was in a one-room squat with a baby. Paradoxically, the empty place I was staying in belonged to the council’s homeless persons unit, and when it threw me out it still had an obligation to rehouse me as it was making me homeless. A Kafkaesque eternity was spent, with my child, sitting in offices arguing with housing officials at the local council. Eventually I got a council flat. Paradise. Later a scheme was introduced that provided me with the deposit for a shared-ownership property. Thus I ascended the magical ladder. I can’t stand people my age talking about property prices as if they were some kind of expert trader – we were just there at the right time.Am I a child of Thatcher? Aren’t we all? I often wonder, because the obsession with property that underpins our entire discourse comes from her. Both Margaret Thatcher and Michael Heseltine were heavily invested in John Rawls’s idea that the ownership of private property would redistribute both capital and social assets. This, we can now see, is absolutely not true.Never mind the subprime crash, the market cannot meet our needs at all. Not enough houses are being built and the ones that are cause unease. Even the Daily Mail reports that new flats in Canary Wharf, studios, the size of tube carriages, will have a monthly rent starting at £2,100 (triple the average price). But worry not, they come with communal areas and wine bars.Who would cheer this kind of insanity on? The surge in house prices could only be good news if I had no children or, indeed, if there was no such thing as society and I never had to leave my house and see how bad things really were."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef31e1c66c439b968368182907c63c9805717a7/0_33_3999_2399/master/3999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a1e5c1cb371bf26bb5707893fe48694","title":"priti patel hostile environment","story":"It’s the home secretary’s trickiest week since her ‘holiday’ in Israel, but at least she’s visible. Where’s the prime minister?According to officials from one of her former departments, Priti Patel was given to coming out of her office and inquiring: “Why is everyone so fucking useless?” Very bold. This is a bit like Donald Trump coming out of his office and asking why everyone has spectacularly stupid hair. The perma-smirking Patel has now moved on to the Home Office, where this week she was accused of bullying staff, trying to oust her most senior official, and creating an “atmosphere of fear” within the department. As opposed to outside of it, which is the norm. If nothing else, it’s a failure of management. To get the best out of people who you want to do their worst, you need to create the right working environment. It’s why the offices of S.P.E.C.T.R.E have a great creche, a smoothie bar, and two “I don’t feel like killing” days per annum for every employee.As for the Home Office, a complex department already regarded as malevolent, it is now in the hands of someone who recently gave an interview in which she repeatedly confused “counter-terrorism” with “terrorism”. This whole “Priti Patel is home secretary” scenario has the flavour of one of those US news stories where some open-carry idiot’s toddler has leant forward in their car seat and pulled a gun out of the backseat pocket. If you’re one of those people who get off on saying “I told you so”, then fine. But really, there are no good outcomes here. One of the more eye-catching Home Office briefings against her this week declared that Patel was “not committed to the rule of law”. Given she’s home secretary, that feels akin to a doctor not being committed to the idea of medicine. Should it not be vaguely disqualifying?Arguably, then, it’s been the trickiest week for Priti since the one when she went on a private family holiday to Israel with her husband and then-nine-year-old son, and met with … hang on, we’re going to need a colon here because there’s rather a lot of this: prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior foreign ministry diplomat, the public security minister, the leader of the Yesh Atid party, at least nine NGO leaders, staff at a hospital, two charity bosses … There are several more, but all you need to know is that this was your classic holiday-with-kids. “Can we go to a waterpark?” “No. Mummy needs some me-time in the Golan Heights.”I’m only kidding – presumably the husband did the childcare while Priti relaxed on a lounger at the Knesset. Or maybe everyone was included, with the grownups playing it all as an elaborate fib, like when you try to persuade your children that something grim is a fun game. “You said we were going to have an ice-cream.” “I know but I’ve got something even better – it’s Benjamin Netanyahu!” (I mean … we’ve all met some ghastly people on holiday, haven’t we, but that’s got to be pushing it.)Despite being resigned from office after that little jolly, Priti Patel is now home secretary, a yin whose yang is the statement, “Dominic Raab is now foreign secretary”. And in keeping with the ironicidal themes of the Boris Johnson administration, it this week fell to madam to front the government’s new policy barring unskilled workers from coming to the UK.Patel insisted those jobs previously filled by immigrant workers would be stepped up to by Britons currently classed as “economically inactive” – a rationale that means so much more coming from someone always classed as intellectually inactive. One theory is that last Thursday’s cabinet reshuffle brought bad news from Priti’s magic mirror, which no longer gave the desired answer when she inquired of it: “Who is the dimmest of them all?” So this week has been all about restoring herself to her rightful throne.Either way, Dominic Cummings will doubtless enjoy the torrent of briefing against Patel, because it plays into his narrative that the sole brake on this government’s genius is the civil service. Cummings has made so much of his intention to revolutionise “the blob” that the only reading that flatters him assumes that he wishes to do quite the opposite. Otherwise, why play it like he has? If you talk to people who have genuinely revolutionised any established institution, the absolute first thing they will tell you is that you never, ever do it by announcing that plan when you arrive. If you do, you set up resistance and defensiveness from the start.So has our beanie-hatted strategist cocked this battle up before it was even fought? You’ve heard of Sun Tzu – meet his brother, Shi-Tzu. Of course, I’m being unfair, because you can’t fault Cummings on the old election-winning. But it increasingly feels like his plan to remake the state could end up commuted down to shifting the location of some lobby journalist briefings and firing a few spads. As physicist Murray Gell-Mann once remarked: BIG WOWS. The question is not if but when the Cummings flounce-out happens. A big fan of interdisciplinary enlightenment, I know he’d be stimulated to learn it was exactly the same with Geri and the Spice Girls. It doesn’t take a superforecaster to see that Dominic will sooner or later be a superblogger again.And so to the impossibly brief tenure of superforecaster Andrew Sabisky. Cummings’s first hire after his appeal for “weirdos and misfits” to work in No 10 ended up with the apparently unvetted Sabisky flaming out on Monday. When Cummings left his house for work the next day, he was accosted by a journalist shouting laconically: “Have you got any more weirdos?” This is definitely my favourite doorstep inquiry since Michael Crick greeted Peter Mandelson one morning with the salutation: “Will you be telling any lies today, Mr Mandelson?”But let’s get real here for a minute and ask: how weird was Cummings’s weirdo, really? When Classique Dom put out his famous APB, I was envisaging someone like the brilliant non-binary quantitative analyst in Billions, an unconventional genius with a fascinating and mysterious backstory. Instead, the very first “weirdo” Cummings went for was some basic Oxbridge thinktank twat, at least 436 of which can be found wanking on the wrong side of the velvet rope at the Spectator party at Tory conference. Yes, he’s a dreary little eugenicist bro. But aren’t they all, dear.Still, on the show goes. Indeed, speaking of the economically inactive, whatever happened to the prime minister? One hears so little about Boris Johnson these days, and sees him even less. His career refusal to even pretend to give a shit has been noticed by some in the worst flood-hit communities, who are more likely to be visited by Elvis than Boris.According to briefings, the PM spent much of the week holed up in Chevening, the Kent country house normally at the disposal of the foreign secretary. It seems Chequers is being renovated, so Johnson must have commandeered the next grace-and-favour property down. Don’t get me wrong, I’m pleased for the Chevening locals. I don’t think any of us would wish to meet Raab on a remote country lane. And perhaps this is how the PM means to conduct his premiership – with the odd mad appearance on the battlements, but in general concealed from public view like some Victorian liability. It’s a living, I suppose. But is it a life?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee760e9e076a16d50f83585a6e7bb8c121199854/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0984d265e1c7f7580a1152b611f6fa40","title":"nigel godrich webchat ultraista radiohead producer","story":"The Ultraísta member and Radiohead producer will be answering your questions at  HQ from 2pm GMT on Tuesday 25 FebruaryIt’s been eight years since Nigel Godrich’s band Ultraísta released their debut album (we called it “a producer’s album, but not without the benefits that come from stepping out from behind the desk”), and now the trio are back with Sister, out on 13 March.

What will this mean for households, the environment and the traditional roaring open fire?These measures will help, but they should only be a start. The block on sales of coal and wet wood will reduce one major source of harmful air pollution, but there are others including cars, trucks, manufacturing and construction. Tighter controls on vehicle and factory emissions will be necessary if the government is serious about reducing cases of childhood asthma and the sometimes fatal long-term heart and lung problems related to PM2.5. A ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars will not be put in place until 2035. The new policy’s effectiveness will also depend on implementation and closing potential loopholes such as the clause that allows bulk purchases (two cubic metres or more) of wet wood as long as it is sold with advice on how to dry it.Very little, at least in the short term when people are likely to switch to dry wood or manufactured smokeless fuels. Looking further ahead, the extra cost of that fuel might encourage more house owners to consider making their homes more energy efficient, which would be help to reduce emissions. UK buildings have one of the worst records in Europe when it comes to retaining heat.Switching to lower-carbon or renewable energy, such as ground-source heat pumps, would make an even bigger difference, but this would require infrastructure investment and incentives from the government to make the alternatives affordable and widely available. If the UK wants to have a double-win on air pollution and climate, another option would be action on transport, including tighter controls on car emissions, more investment in public transit, greater support for electric vehicles and a levy on aviation fuel (which is currently tax-free). Compared with that, the restrictions on domestic coal use and wet wood are a drop in the ocean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5a62744ab9e530e56cc222c72f11d9c350ed902/95_306_1915_1149/master/1915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d0521ad2f7783c92c35be65bcff33d","title":"it is a little puzzling readers on early signs of spring","story":"We asked you to tell us about the early signs of spring near you. Here’s what some of you saidThere are beautiful signs of spring popping up in the grounds of the hospice where I work. It’s hard not to have mixed emotions: it is beautiful, especially bathed in bright winter sunshine, but knowing it’s only early February means we could just as quickly have deep snow next week. The life that’s appearing feels all the more fragile at this time of year and in turn it’s a reminder of the crisis our planet is facing.The photo of flowers above was taken this year on a ‘path of life’ at St Gemma’s hospice in Leeds on 6 February. The path is a place where anyone can come to reflect and remember. The wintry photo is from a similar time last year on 1 February when there was snow on the ground. Looking at the two they look like completely different seasons. In early February last year our gardening team were out clearing snow off the paths, whereas this year there’s barely been a hint of it. Natalie Clince, digital marketing manager, Leeds With the warmer weather our rhubarb is growing strong – which is a concern if we have frost later. Our rhubarb is organic and has been in the garden since we bought the house over 30 years ago. This year they seem to be appearing incredibly early. The daffodils are just coming up now too. I was in shock at how early they were and how beautiful and vibrant the colours are against the starkness of winter. Clare Howarth, 54, designer, from ManchesterSerra da Estrela is the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal, reaching 1,993 metres above the sea. Back in the late 80s and early 90s it was very common to see snow at this time of year. Lately it is rare a snowfall will last more than a couple of days, except at the top. It’s actually becoming more common to watch the fruit trees blossoming earlier. The above photo was taken on 5 February this year, a very warm day of about 20C, and shows an almond tree in bloom – something that usually happens in early March. The below photo was taken in February 2013 at the same location but showing the surroundings on a snowy day. Isabel Garcia, 35, PortugalMy partner and I are passionate hill walkers, hikers and in general outdoorsy people, so there’s plenty of room to compare. It’s been an incredibly warm winter this year and we’ve barely noticed the snowcaps on the hills in Lomond and Trossachs national park. Last year we were not able to take the road over the hills from Aberfoyle due to ice and snow today it was completely clear and not a sign of snow. We found these flowers during a walk in February this year around Loch Katrine, near the southern slopes of Primrose Hill. It’s a stark contrast compared to last winter here in Scotland when we went over snow of 10-15 centimetres for many kilometres – bloom was completely out of question. Martynas Virzintas, 39, hospitality manager, from Glasgow Spring is starting to burst out all over. The snowdrops have appeared and opened fully within a few days which is a little puzzling as they seem to have done so more rapidly than usual. Rather strangely, most of the flowers are coming out at the same time, even though they are normally staggered between late January through until April. Often the UK winter is persistently dull and grey – but not this year. David Seedhouse, author, Wolverly, West MidlandsI am chair of an environment scrutiny commission looking at ways we can reduce our carbon emissions in Southwark. I live in the middle of the city on the river and took the below photo in Southwark park, one of the oldest in London. I have noticed that spring is coming earlier and earlier each year. Snowdrops, prunus, narcissus and iris are not usually fully out but they are in full vigour right now. Blossom does make dreary places look beautiful and at the moment the scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter. Leanne Werner, Labour councillor in Southwark, LondonMount Fuji is visible most days from the training ring where I work as a horse groom. Locals say that usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white. Last year there was more snow in January and February, whereas this year Fuji-san is only half covered in snow. You can see this from the photo I took on 3 January this year. Even though it was last year, when I arrived in Japan on 21 March, I noticed the sakura (cherry blossom) bloomed four days later when normally this doesn’t happen until April.

But since Francesco Risso joined the label in 2016, the direction has been more challenging still.Despite his own very menacing Donnie Darko outfit, Risso’s collection stayed on the right side of weird this season. Its theme was patchwork and collage. Many of the clothes were familiar silhouettes – shift dresses, midi dresses and crombie coats – recreated from contrasting scraps of fabric.There were franken-cardigans – knitted panels held together with thick, visible stitching – and dresses constructed from two separate garments: half of a white, satin bandeau dress, like a wedding gown, stitched on top of a matt black cocktail frock. There were beautiful frayed and faded sections of tapestries stitched onto dresses and fashioned into nipped-waisted, drop shouldered coats with flattened, exaggerated sleeves.The coats were particularly gorgeous, spliced patches in warm complementary tones of bronze, caramel, black and chocolate. Anna Wintour wordlessly conferred her approval by wearing the only patchwork item from Marni’s previous collection – a coat in multiple shades of grey – as she watched from the front row.The show’s message, said Risso backstage, was “finding beauty in the leftovers”. There was a “DIY Alice in Wonderland theme”, he said, and described creating the collection in a low-waste way, collaging “from beginning to the end” and using offcuts from one look to later make handbags, for example.There are clear links between patchwork and sustainability, the biggest buzzword in fashion at the moment as the industry faces an environmental backlash.Earlier on Friday, at the Tod’s show, there was a section of patchwork garments which the brand’s new creative director, Walter Chiapponi, said had been conceived because “patchwork is very sustainable”, unlike the often very wasteful standard practice of cutting patterns from large sections of cloth. This interest in patchwork also echoes the recent success of the cult US menswear brand Bode, which has received great acclaim for creating a nostalgic clothes from vintage fabrics.Risso – who has used offcuts and recycled pieces in previous collections – was cautious about applying the word “sustainable” to his own collection, however.”I get very itchy when I hear ‘sustainable’ words,” he said backstage. “We are trying to transform Marni much more into a conscious place where things are done in a better way.” With this particular collection, he said, parts are “recuperation” – Risso’s word for reclaimed fabric – “and parts are not, so it’s a blend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d9f25e18dccc0ee7db538909440f8b79a6350a/0_242_6096_3658/master/6096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29db262274262ce2a3661b7116707965","title":"harvey weinstein trial jury sopranos actors testimony annabella sciorra","story":"Jury indicated that in three counts they have reached their decision, and will now break and return to deliberations on the other two counts on MondayThe jury at Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial in New York appears to have reached a verdict on three of the five counts facing him, though they are deadlocked on the most serious charge – predatory sexual assault.Shortly after the lunch break on Friday, the five men and seven women of the jury were called back into court having indicated that in three counts they have reached their decision. These are: the count that alleges the fallen movie mogul forced oral sex on a then Project Runway production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and two counts of rape in 2013 of a woman who the  is not naming as her intentions on identification are unclear.However, the jury also made clear that they cannot reach a unanimous decision on counts one andor three. Those predatory sexual assault counts involve sex crimes against more than one woman, and carry the stiffest sentence of all amounting to at least 10 years in prison and possibly life.After a nail-biting few minutes in court 99 of the New York supreme court, in which an imminent verdict appeared possible, the judge James Burke, in consultation with prosecutors and Weinstein’s defense team, told the jury to keep on going. Weinstein’s lawyers had said they would accept a partial verdict, but prosecutors said no and Burke refused to do so. Burke then said with a little more work the jury could reach unanimity on those counts too. The jury will now pick up its deliberations on Monday.The jury’s problems with the predatory sexual assault counts are in tune with their requests over the past two days. They have been focused on Annabella Sciorra, the former Sopranos actor.She testified in the trial that Weinstein, 67, brutally raped her some time during the winter of 1993 to 1994 in her Gramercy Park apartment in Manhattan. The alleged incident occurred so long ago it is beyond the statute of limitations and cannot be prosecuted in its right.Sciorra is though included in the predatory sexual assault charges in addition to Haley and the unnamed alleged rape victim.The fourth day of deliberations began on Friday with a re-reading of large chunks of Sciorra’s testimony, at the jury’s request.Before going home the day before, the Manhattan jury had sent the judge a note saying it wanted to review the cross-examination of the Sopranos actor and any follow-up questioning by prosecutors. About 90 minutes into the reading, the jurors notified the judge they had “heard enough” and resumed their deliberations. The jury has already focused on emails that Weinstein sent regarding Sciorra, including ones to the private Israeli spy agency he allegedly enlisted to dig up dirt on would-be accusers as reporters were working on stories about allegations against him in 2017.Sciorra, now 59, was the first accuser to testify and took the witness stand nearly a month ago, telling jurors how the once-powerful movie mogul showed up unexpectedly at the door of her Manhattan apartment before barging in and raping and forcibly performing oral sex on her.On cross-examination, Sciorra was grilled about why she opened her door in the first place and didn’t find a way to escape if she was under attack.Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno asked: “Why didn’t you try to run out of the apartment? Did you scratch him? Try to poke him in the eyes?”“He was too big” to fight off, Sciorra responded at one point. “He was frightening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76020c4d602f5826f7cc2297cee01f780c0334f8/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=368073330f56a7bdb441f9f3cd234cc6","title":"harsh spotlight shines on frank lampard as honeymoon period fades","story":"Chelsea’s youngsters were the feelgood story earlier in the season, but their waning influence has led to increased pressure on their managerIt is possible to sympathise with Frank Lampard when he suggests that Chelsea, their grip on fourth place loosening with each shoddy display, are performing above expectations. The club’s transfer ban left the youngest manager in the Premier League unable to act when Eden Hazard took his virtuoso skills to Real Madrid last summer, N’Golo Kanté is injured again and Kepa Arrizabalaga, the most expensive goalkeeper in the world, has lost his place to the 38-year-old Willy Caballero.In that context it was unsurprising that Lampard was unhappy after Chelsea, able to spend again after having their transfer embargo lifted by the court of arbitration for sport in December, failed to strengthen their attack last month. The 41-year-old grumbled on deadline day and there have been rumblings since then, suggestions that the head coach had grown frustrated with the recruitment department, whispers that the hierarchy has questioned the decision to drop Arrizabalaga.Yet Lampard denied he was under pressure to restore the £72m Spaniard to the side for Saturday’s home game against Tottenham – “I am absolutely together with the board,” he said – and there was a show of unity when Chelsea completed a deal to sign Hakim Ziyech from Ajax last week. Ziyech, a Lampard pick, will surely enhance this blunt side’s creativity when he arrives next season.Lampard targeted the Moroccan playmaker in January, only for Ajax to resist a mid-season sale. It was a difficult market and Lampard’s outburst at the end of the window, which invited pressure from above, shows he knows the pressure will increase if he fails to qualify for the Champions League.The honeymoon period is fading. Although Lampard is a Chelsea legend, there were boos after his side suffered their seventh home defeat of the season last Monday, losing 2-0 to Manchester United. They have collected 15 points from their past 14 league games and their 12-point lead over José Mourinho’s Spurs is down to one.The caveats continue. Kanté is out for three weeks with an adductor injury Lampard is unsure when Christian Pulisic will be available Antonio Rüdiger was absent for long spells before Christmas Callum Hudson-Odoi has had little niggles and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who is in the squad for Saturday, has not played since tearing an achilles last May.Yet Lampard has made mistakes. Chelsea have struggled when visiting sides sit deep, which will surely be Mourinho’s approach on his return to Stamford Bridge. They lack penetration from attacking midfield. Willian and Pedro are the wrong side of 30 and Ross Barkley is inconsistent.Hudson-Odoi, Pulisic and Mason Mount are learning and although Lampard cannot be blamed for missed chances, there are questions about his use of Michy Batshuayi and Olivier Giroud. They have found opportunities limited because of Tammy Abraham’s excellent form up front.Lampard’s treatment of Giroud is odd. Although the France striker disappointed when handed a rare start in the home defeat by West Ham on 30 November, the 33-year-old has not even made the bench at times and, having been denied a move last month, was left out of the 18 for the 2-2 draw with Leicester on 1 February.Lampard wants to press from the front, which requires speed, but Batshuayi’s all-round game is poor and the Belgian underwhelmed when he deputised for Abraham against United. Giroud impressed after coming on, a tight VAR call denying him a goal, and Lampard needs to be pragmatic in a transitional season. Giroud’s hold-up play could be effective if an ankle injury keeps Abraham out against Spurs.Chelsea, who host Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday, need a way to function without Abraham and the shortage of reliable goalscorers is exacerbated by their defensive frailties. They are too open in midfield and concede soft goals, especially from set pieces. Lampard has chopped and changed in central defence and he has reservations about Arrizabalaga, whose future is in doubt after several costly errors.The spotlight is unforgiving at the moment. A few months ago everything was about Chelsea’s youngsters. They were the season’s feelgood story. Yet Fikayo Tomori has not been seen as much in recent weeks, Reece James’s positional sense needs work at right-back and Mount’s influence has waned.The Premier League is tough and Lampard, a rookie coach, is also feeling it. They need the Champions League and playing Spurs gives Chelsea a chance to rediscover their mojo. Chelsea were outstanding when they won 2-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in December. Mount sparkled and Lampard triumphed against his old manager, catching Mourinho cold with a switch to a back three. There have been positives. The story is far from over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0400ae908935d80968a2faa8ccf33cfdacc821f1/2081_145_1748_1049/master/1748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f03079b2ebf3d70a8b51f6f35a9c8837","title":"jose mourinho finishing in top four with spurs would be my greatest achievement","story":"José Mourinho believes that finishing the season in the Premier League top four would be one of the best achievements of his career as Tottenham struggle through their enduring injury crisis.As Mourinho prepared for a return to Chelsea on Saturday afternoon after Spurs’ stale Champions League defeat by Leipzig, he again underlined his frustration at the loss of both Son Heung-min, who underwent surgery after fracturing his arm against Aston Villa, and Harry Kane. For Mourinho, a successful season this year may even rank above his second-placed finish with Manchester United in 2018, an achievement he once called “one of the best jobs of my career”.“Tottenham without Harry or Sonny, without one of them, doesn’t win a match since 2014,” he said. “That means a lot. That means that Sonny and Harry score the majority of goals that Tottenham scores. This season was so, so negatively special that we are going to be without them both at the same time for a lot of matches.“If we manage to finish top four it’s something incredible. Incredible achievement for the boys. So we have to give everything we have.”There will be an even brighter spotlight than usual on Mourinho when he returns to Stamford Bridge against his former captain Frank Lampard. As vigorously as he underlined the significance of Spurs’ injury crisis, Mourinho played down the relevance of his return to the club that he led to their first League title in 49 years in 2004.Despite injuries casting a shadow over his club, a tough run of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League matches ahead and a 12.30pm start on Saturday, Mourinho was in a good mood. He paused his press conference to pump his fists towards passing children from Tottenham’s youth groups and he initially responded to the question about United’s 2018 season by jokingly referencing the ongoing legal disputes of Manchester City, that year’s champions: “Maybe I win that title.”Mourinho’s underlying message was that a “good test” awaits his injury-riddled team at they battle for a place in the top four. “In three months we went from being close to the relegation position to being one point from the top four. Amazing effort by everyone.“So, now that we are in this position, we earned the right to fight for it. It is difficult. At the moment, probably lots of people think this will be impossible, but we are going to fight and look specifically to this match which is the only thing that matters now. Let’s go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c36b9008da55429a795ca8e7ca6ee759b3ae99e4/0_0_3167_1900/master/3167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41a03ba7f587bd361e6c441ffa5832e2","title":"why jose mourinho was wrong to hang deli alli out to dry","story":"By taking off star playmaker during Champions League game, Tottenham manager risks fracturing his confidencePerhaps, on reflection, José Mourinho wished it had been Dele’s brother after all. As Dele Alli hurled his water bottle to the ground in fury at being substituted against RB Leipzig on Wednesday night, as first right boot and then left boot were flung off, Mourinho might have been tempted to conclude that his attempts at motivating his star playmaker had not met with unreserved success.It was Alli, after all, whom Mourinho had singled out during his first press conference in November as one of his most important projects. “Are you Dele or Dele’s brother?” he asked during their first conversation. “OK. Play like Dele. The real Dele.” Now, in the aftermath of a first-leg Champions League defeat, the tone would be slightly different.“I think he was angry with his performance, not with me,” Mourinho said of Alli’s outburst. “I think he understands why I took him off. And our performance improved.” Ouch. Factually, of course, there was very little to dispute. Alli had been poor all evening: a pale imitation of his very best, with no shots on goal and only 28 touches, the same as his goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, and the substitute Tanguy Ndombele, who replaced Alli in the 64th minute. Only five of those touches came in the final third. Only two came in the Leipzig penalty area.Even so, publicly flannelling one of your key players before a crucial game against your local rivals: let’s optimistically file that one under “Bold moves”.And as Tottenham shape up for a Saturday lunchtime fixture at Chelsea that could be a decisive milestone in the race for Champions League qualification, one senses this was a gamble with quite a bit riding on it. Chelsea have historically been one of Alli’s favourite teams to play against. He has six goals against them in eight appearances, the most of any opponent. Since Mourinho’s arrival, moreover his output has risen sharply with more goals (six in all competitions), more expected goals (0.40 per 90 minutes) and more expected assists (0.22 per 90 minutes, both a significant increase on his last 12 months under Mauricio Pochettino).Under normal circumstances this would be a fixture to relish. But the Leipzig game, along with other recent games against high-quality opposition, offered something of a corrective. One could see Alli’s exasperation growing as he was forced into chasing a succession of long balls into the channels, frozen out of the buildup, feeding off scraps.Mourinho has said he sees Alli primarily as a No 10 playing off the striker, rather than as a midfielder, but for a player who likes to feel involved in play nights like these can prove especially frustrating.Partly, of course, this is a function of circumstances: with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min injured, with Christian Eriksen gone, Alli is the only remaining member of the attacking quartet that for a couple of seasons was one of the most lethal front fours in Europe.Paradoxically the scarcity of options up front has simultaneously piled extra pressure on him to produce while also starving him of the supply chain that gives him the best chance of doing so. But to a large extent, this is also a product of deliberate choices.Mourinho’s defence-first strategy in big games has condemned one of their most creative players to long periods at the periphery. His insistence that Alli play primarily in the final third has raised his goal output while arguably diminishing his overall influence. And his decision to criticise Alli publicly risks fracturing the confidence of a player who, for all the brash confidence of his public persona, is a good deal more introspective than many give him credit for.One could equally argue, of course, that Alli is the sort of player who requires the occasional rocket. That was certainly the view of Pochettino, who while lionising Alli in public often felt the need to point out his shortcomings in private. And the brainless coronavirus joke he posted to his Snapchat a couple of weeks ago was hardly the act of a player ready to take on greater responsibility. Alli will be 24 in a couple of months and should theoretically be entering his peak years. Instead he is still trying to sustain the jet-propelled promise of his early career, his place in England’s Euro 2020 squad not secure.Alli’s mercurial talents have always been as much curse as gift. And there is perhaps a broader question: whether players are ultimately responsible for their performances and output or whether they are inextricably bound by circumstances: the team around them, the culture and ambience of the club, the tactics and strategy being pursued. Put more simply: does Mourinho have anything more to offer Alli than mind games? Or is he, to all purposes, on his own?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/febc5dd55386e86d665393373e85bb8475982ee0/0_420_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a400eefc733645c9ba015b2e7590009","title":"young man u fan asks liverpool manager to start losing games jurgen klopp letter","story":"Ten-year-old Daragh Curley wrote to the Liverpool manager asking him if he could make his team lose a few gamesThe Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, has said he was so charmed by the sheer cheek of a young Manchester United fan who wrote to ask whether he could start making Liverpool lose games that he sent the 10-year-old a personal reply.Daragh Curley, from County Donegal, wrote to the 52-year-old German coach this week asking him to engineer a few Liverpool defeats so they would not win the Premier League this season.“If you win nine more games, then you have the best unbeaten run in English football. Being a United fan that is very sad,” Daragh wrote. “So the next time Liverpool play, please make them lose. You should just let the other team score. I hope I have convinced you to not win the league or any other match ever again.”Klopp wrote back to Daragh, saying: “Unfortunately, on this occasion I cannot grant your request, not through choice anyway.“As much as you want Liverpool to lose it is my job to do everything that I can to help Liverpool to win as there are millions of people around the world who want that to happen, so I really do not want to let them down.”But he went on: “Luckily for you, we have lost games in the past and we will lose games in the future because that is football.“The problem is when you are 10 years old you think that things will always be as they are now but if there is one thing I can tell you as 52 years old it is that this most definitely isn’t the case.”At a news conference on Friday, Klopp described the missive as a smart move, adding: “It was just nice … it was cheeky. It was everything together.“Cheeky, 10-years-old, which I think is a nice age where you should start being cheeky and it was smart as well. It was just that I thought it’s a good idea. Try it. Why not?”Liverpool head into Monday’s home game against West Ham United 22 points clear of second-placed Manchester City and it now seems inevitable that they will win their first league title in 30 years.Klopp’s team are yet to lose a league game this season, winning 25 and drawing one so far.The boy’s father, Gordon Curley, told the BBC that the family were surprised when a registered letter from the Liverpool manager arrived.“I would be a Man Utd fan myself, it’s grating that Liverpool are doing so well, but behind it all you have to respect Klopp and what he’s done,” he said. “He came across as a nice guy all along, I suppose this letter really confirms to me that he is a decent, decent guy.“What I love about the letter is that it’s about sportsmanship and respect too and I think saying that to a 10-year-old is great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43f0ff685272c8596fdc576050a8da834a88184/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42545bc27acb375a87bb156fc287781f","title":"oliver burkeman dont give up cash value seeing what spend","story":"Cards and contactless are convenient – but New York is right to fight for cashPart of the explanation is that credit cards postpone the unpleasantness of actually paying until the bill arrives. But research on debit cards and digital wallets points to the more intriguing phenomenon of psychological distance: cash just feels more immediately real, and losing it feels more painful. Of course, coins and notes are “virtual”, too, in the sense that they only have any value thanks to a web of laws and agreements. But they retain a crucial component of concreteness, demonstrated most clearly by the fact that if you set fire to a £20 note, you really are £20 worse off.I suspect many of us still implicitly interact with cash as though a well-dressed bank manager is sitting on the other side of the cashpoint, hurrying off to fetch your money from a little box with your name on it. It’s much harder to feel so possessive about digital information. And contactless payment? That barely seems more real than simply thinking about making a purchase.Worryingly, I know of no research to suggest that this unreality effect is diminishing as we grow accustomed to a cashless world. Instead, frictionless payment is embedding itself as a prime case of what has been called “the tyranny of convenience”, whereby technology makes it easier to get what we desire (the fancy new headphones I’ve been coveting, say) but harder to be the kind of person we would rather be (who can manage without fancy headphones). In the useful phrase of the philosopher Harry Frankfurt, it undermines our capacity to “want what we want to want”.A slightly more down-to-earth way of putting it is just that we’re each a bundle of different, often contradictory desires – and it’s no surprise, nor necessarily even cause for condemnation, that businesses focus on stimulating the ones they can milk for profit.This does mean that, as technology continues to smooth our daily lives, we shall increasingly need to develop a taste for friction, for discovering that very particular, bracing sort of pleasure that comes from embracing minor discomforts – like making yourself dig through your bag for some actual cash – rather than always seeking to eliminate them.This is a close cousin of another taste that is equally worth developing: the miserly joy of not buying something that would have made you happy – because it makes you even happier to deny some corporation the chance to relieve you of your money.Amanda Lang makes the case against the too effortless life in her 2017 book The Beauty of Discomfort: How What We Avoid Is What We Need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7be2e79ee86ae2ffe866327f4fb635aeb0205e/338_454_5278_3167/master/5278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b19c9154b08e02eb0b06566986151afa","title":"tell us have you moved across europe for love","story":"If you have moved across Europe to pursue romance we would like to hear from you.

And does it serve any purpose?Things came to a head on Dominic Cummings’s doorstep on 11 February. “The night-time is the right time to fight crime,” he told waiting reporters, before going on to recommend PJ Masks for jobs in the cabinet. PJ Masks are children’s TV characters. The question had been about HS2. Pressed for more detail, the “maverick” replied: “I can’t think of a rhyme.”It was no more or less sophisticated than the two fingers it represented meaningless and silly, it was intended, one assumes, to put the journalists in their place. “I have not authorised this conversation, therefore this conversation is null, void, a string of noises disguised as words.”You can actually – I believe – track his thought process. Some days before, a reporter from ITV caught Cummings exiting a restaurant, just as the UK exited the EU. He asked a series of admittedly banal questions: “How do you plan to bring the country back together?” “You’ve worked so hard to this moment, does the real work begin now?” And Cummings’s reply, couched in irritable hectoring, like a horrible headteacher, was: “Are you going to walk along asking inane questions? Is that your best move?” Since then, he has been studiedly inane in his interactions. “Two can play at that game,” must be his reasoning, though an eager public awaits his 10,000-word blog on the subject.So is doorstepping Cummings a fruitful exercise, if these are its ground rules? Or does it merely underscore his immense power, the absolute carelessness for reputation and respectability it has brought with it, and fill the airwaves with the swill of his disregard? Are these journalists just making us all depressed, or are they performing the valuable service of holding him to account? They certainly think the latter.None of these reporters or camera people wanted to be identified or quoted, which I understood. You’ll just have to accept that they said what I say they did. I realise this is unfamiliar in a low-trust environment, but there it is.They’re not there every day – on Monday 17, it was just me, hiding behind a tree. On Tuesday, the pack arrives, though there aren’t as many of them as you might suppose: one solitary photographer, a camera person with a producer, and a journalist whose pay grade this gig is unfathomably below. To be standing outside a big-boned north London house at 7.20 in the morning, this person’s crusade must, on some level, be personal: a battle against the unaccountability of modern politics everywhere. Someone should definitely write a novel about him. “This is the second most important man in the country,” the journalist – let’s call them the Crusader – says. “But where do we get to question him? When does he appear in parliament to explain himself?”The photographer attached to him is a freelancer, working constantly, for newspapers and news agencies, five years out of university, in what I suggest might be his dream job. “Well, yes, until you have to start doing it. I just hope he comes out before the parking starts.”The TV team, producer and camera person are pooling their clips, so these will eventually go out on Sky and ITV, too, even though they’re from the BBC. The story on Tuesday was the resignation of Andrew Sabisky, forced to stand aside following the unearthing of racist, misogynistic and eugenicist remarks.The conversation on the doorstep while we waited was wide-ranging and interesting: we discussed other eugenicists of note (Jeffrey Epstein, apparently) the nature of UK politics now, which has become very stage-managed – pre-briefings and briefings, information fed to one or two preselected journalists – and a declining, almost moribund, tradition of finding things out for yourself by going to a place and asking a human being.A black cab lurks 20 metres away with its engine off. At about 7.50am, it creeps towards the house. Two minutes after that, Cleo Watson pegs up the street and jumps into it. “You’re late today,” the BBC producer says. “It’s recess,” she replies briskly. “The world is still turning,” says the Crusader. “She’s Cummings’s Spad,” the cameraperson says and everyone laughs – it’s a grim procedural joke, since advisers don’t get their own advisers, like Russian dolls – except in, you know, authoritarian regimes.The cab rigmarole leaves little room for error – Cummings is plainly coming out any minute – but we’ve reckoned without the bin man. “If you were outside my house, I throw a bucket of water over you.” “What have you got to hide?” I asked, and he said: “Nothing. It’s just incredibly annoying,” and splashed me with bin juice, though in a lighthearted way. “It’s not a very nice thing to do to somebody,” the photographer had already volunteered. Somewhere in the morality of the doorstep is a reality about politics this is something you would only do in a time of low transparency and high conflict. So that’s what it reveals. The words themselves, not so much.Cummings comes out of the side door, with a diffident gait but grumpy, chin-out face. The Crusader asks neutrally whether he regrets the Sabisky appointment. The BBC producer asks whether he’s a fan of eugenics, then: “Have you got any more weirdos?” This is a reference to the famous job ad that yielded the candidate in the first place. It is to the last question that Cummings mumbles an answer, which ends “… instead of political pundits who don’t know what they’re talking about”. He jumps in the cab with Watson and we watch it back on the pavement. I can make out the words superforecasters, but we all conclude that what came before was gibberish. By the time it appears on Sky, two hours later, is perfectly audible: “Read Philip Tetlock’s superforecasters, instead of political pundits who don’t know what they’re talking about.”Has this reference to a favoured political scientist added to our understanding of the Downing Street machine? It is, after all, still gibberish, even when you can hear it. Sabisky isn’t a superforecaster, he’s a half-baked incel who can’t even be bothered to read the science behind the poisonous new world order he espoused (tldr: eugenics doesn’t work on humans. Only apples, sometimes horses). Have we held Cummings to account? What would that even look like, bar his resignation? Would the discourse be any less rich if this moment hadn’t happened? We may not have known for certain that Cummings thinks he and his ilk have superpowers and the rest of us don’t know anything, but we probably could have guessed.And yet I find I have a new respect for the principle. He holds a huge amount of power, and accepts none of the responsibilities of transparency, persuasion and, actually, courtesy that go along with that. To see this and ignore it fosters a sense of impotence, even nihilism. When there are no longer people prepared to wait outside his house at 7am, we’ll really be in trouble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youPassengers onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have been able to leave after being quarantined since 3 February.Hundreds of people – who spent quarantine largely confined to their cabins – disembarked the ship to board buses and taxis.According to the South China Morning Post, a second person in Hong Kong has died from the coronavirus.

At the time, the charity was forced to deny his departure was related to claims of bullying which surfaced on social media via an anonymous Twitter account, subsequently deleted.Hughes, who co-chaired a dementia friendly communities champion group for the former prime minister David Cameron, is due to take up a new role as chief executive of Samaritans in May.It has now emerged that a complaint was made to the Charity Commission in February 2018 by a former employee of the Alzheimer’s Society. The complaint raised concerns about the use of settlement agreements with non-disclosure provisions and the sums paid to settle claims.Despite the serious nature of the claims, the commission failed to investigate the complaint or even contact the whistleblower – an oversight the watchdog now admits was a mistake.In the 11-page complaint, the whistleblower said the large payouts by the charity “may also leave the society open to criticism … that it is silencing staff and critics of the organisation, undermining its stated values”.The complainant said they were informed “that the total cost of settlements in the last few years is over £750,000 for staff leaving the society, all with non-disclosure settlement agreement”.The Alzheimer’s Society claims the figure is inaccurate but declined to give its own sum. It said it only used settlements for “legitimate reasons”.The contents of the whistleblower complaint have emerged amid rising wider concern over the use of NDAs by organisations dealing with staff complaints. A House of Commons report last year warned “allegations of unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace are routinely covered up by employers” using NDAs.The charity, which was launched in 1979, invests in dementia care research, runs campaigns and provides 3,000 local support services. It received income of £107m last year, with £80m from public donations. It has received £2.4m in taxpayers’ money over the last two years.An investigation by the  based on information detailed in the complaint and interviews with former employees reveals claims that:Claims about the charity’s handling of grievances are detailed in a 2018 complaint to the Charity Commission. A copy of the complaint, seen by the , flagged concerns about a series of issues, including “the disproportionate and excessive amounts being wasted on settling matters” and the “lack of accountability in the decision-making process to agree to the value of the complaints”.While many complaints made by staff who received settlements and signed NDAs were considered legitimate grievances, the whistleblower expressed concerns that some were not – meaning the charity was simultaneously viewed as a “soft touch”.The former staffer, whose family also made a donation to the Alzheimer’s Society after their mother died of dementia, added in the document: “I am aghast that charitable donations are being spent so recklessly and without the proper risk assessments or effective governance. My family sincerely regret the donation that we made in light of the use of charitable funds on these unnecessary payments.”Separately, a former senior employee at the charity told the  they were shocked at the behaviour they claim they witnessed by Hughes, who is understood to earn up to £160,000 a year.“Jeremy was well known within the organisation as someone with an explosive temper,” they said, “someone who didn’t appreciate being questioned even when this was when his staff were trying to understand what he wanted or what decision was being made.”The source alleged they had witnessed many instances of his poor behaviour, including shouting at junior staff and undermining senior staff, including trustees.They added: “It was widely known that to challenge Jeremy was career-limiting. Jeremy and Brett Terry, the HR director, worked very closely together to cross one was to cross them both and to incur their wrath and bullying.” They described “a culture of fear, or at least ‘keep your head down and don’t tell’”.Corinne Mills, the Alzheimer’s Society’s director of people and organisational development, said the charity took the allegations “very seriously” and that it had “zero tolerance” of bullying.“We have a well-established and robust internal complaints procedure and whistleblowing policy,” she went on, noting that internal processes were regularly reviewed. “We strongly refute the figure of £750k quoted for settlements. We have only used settlement agreements for legitimate reasons and only where other options for resolution have been explored.”The Charity Commission’s director of operations, Helen Earner, confirmed that a complaint was received about the charity in February 2018 but that the commission failed to act. The watchdog is now looking into the complaint. “We should have followed up on the complaint, and that did not happen,” she said.“We acknowledge that in failing to follow up on the complaint at the time, we did not meet the high standards we set ourselves, and which the public rightly expect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3ed7133d1504d1bb1fda325f82d71042b9481e4/92_0_3233_1941/master/3233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f744f751a79930359a016242aa53c70f","title":"tell us have you ever experienced a surgical accident","story":"If you have had a surgical procedure which has gone wrong we would like to hear from youDenis Campbell, health policy editor at the , exclusively reported on Michael Walsh, a shoulder surgeon who was sacked after allegations that he had harmed patients by performing surgery on them unnecessarily or badly.We would like to speak to people who have experienced any kind of surgical accident.

Cameron Bancroft, the other player involved in the tampering plot, is not on this tour.Warner was out for four on the second ball of the game in Johannesburg in a dramatic start. After that, Australia silenced the normally boisterous and occasionally hostile crowd at the Wanderers. Smith made 45 from 32 balls to top score for Australia, but the Aussies were especially rampant with the ball.Mitchell Starc removed the South Africa captain Quinton de Kock on the third ball of the game with one that swung hugely and knocked back his middle stump.South Africa were already struggling at 44-4 when Agar took his hat-trick in his first over into the attack.He had Faf du Plessis (24) caught on the cover boundary off his fourth ball. Andile Phehlukwayo was out lbw next ball and failed with a DRS review. Dale Steyn edged to the Australia captain Aaron Finch at slip to complete the treble.

That total looked even more comfortable just short of the halfway mark of the innings, when opener Alyssa Healy brought up her half-century from 35 balls, and Australia had 67 on the board for the loss of two.Healy had been struggling for runs in the recent tri-series with England and India, but her irrepressible character meant she was never likely to let that worry her. She started her innings with 15 of the first 16 runs, going inside-out over cover as she always does in her pomp, and even with Beth Mooney and Meg Lanning giving up catches cheaply, it didn’t seem of great concern with Healy having dominated the scoring and the strike.But Yadav’s introduction in the 10th over changed the game. Her fourth ball slipped from her hand to give Healy a comfortable full toss, with the Australian keeper cool enough to camp back and pull it over the midwicket rope. But the next ball dipped and landed perfectly, with Healy unable to handle the loop so that she chipped back a return catch.From there, Yadav was in her stride. She cuts a singular figure on the field: barely a metre and a half tall, seeming impossibly tiny from the grandstand, and evoking thoughts of a more amateur style when she loops up her slow, high leg-breaks. But she has been very much a fixture of India’s shift to a successful modern team, with her skill in variations, turn, and landing the ball making her a deceptively difficult prospect.In her second over Yadav unleashed a string of wrong’uns that ran through Australia. The delivery turned away from the left-handed Rachael Haynes, who was stranded trying to reach the pitch of the ball and was comfortably stumped by Taniya Bhatia. Ellyse Perry has the best defence in the world, but the right-hander also walked at Yadav and was bowled first ball as the googly turned back through the gate and took leg stump. Then came Jess Jonassen, another lefty, whose thick edge from a push went fractionally too high and wide for Bhatia to comfortably get the gloves to it. A hat-trick was deflected into the dirt.But the Australians were rattled, and both Yadav and Bhatia shook off the disappointment, teaming up again in Yadav’s third over to remove Jonassen via an edge from a sweep at another googly that turned across the batter. Yadav’s time in the air had everyone’s timing in a mess.Australia still had Ash Gardner and Annabel Sutherland, two of their sweetest strikers of the ball, with 51 runs needed from six overs. With Gardner hitting and clearing the boundary over the next couple of overs, a recovery still looked on. But Bhatia ended that with a brilliant stumping from seamer Shikha Pandey, collecting the ball out wide near the return crease and ing into the stumps.Yadav returned to bowl Gardner with a drag-down that kept very low, but replays showed it had bounced twice before reaching the crease. Under recent law changes that was now a no-ball. But Gardner couldn’t score from the free hit, and Yadav finished the over without the wicket, but having conceded only three singles and the extra. With 27 needed from two overs and three wickets in hand, frantic hitting and running saw Australia fall away.With the bat, India had Deepti Sharma to thank for what ended up being a defendable total, as she calmly assembled an unbeaten 49 after a fast start soon became 47 for 3. This Indian batting side looks most comfortable in the chase, with a set target ahead of them, but batting first can look lost for a plan.Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana were going at 10 an over through the first four, but Mandhana aimed a huge sweep shot at Jonassen’s first ball of the day without even a look, and missed to be plumb leg before for 10. So often her captain Lanning’s go-to when situations are getting out of hand, Jonassen pulled the scoring back beautifully. Verma holed out against Perry after a fast 29 from 15 balls, then Jonassen had India’s key Harmanpreet Kaur stumped for two.With India’s batting frailties starting at number seven, Deepti and Jemimah Rodrigues (26 from 33) had to play a sensible accumulation game and hope that a modest total would be enough. As it turned out, thanks to first-night nerves and one brilliant bowling performance, it was. India take first points in Pool A, with Bangladesh, New Zealand and Sri Lanka to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/410d2c832ecb1db908e9c6439f23b41a7a695178/0_114_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b6dd2a522175e249f8e176d35a7d295","title":"airbnb call english councils powers regulate caroline lucas","story":"Caroline Lucas urges move to help ease ‘intolerable’ pressure on availability of local housingLocal councils in England must be given powers to regulate Airbnb and other short-term letting sites in order to alleviate the “intolerable” pressure they put on the availability of local housing, the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, has said.Her intervention followed a  investigation that found one Airbnb listing for every four residential properties in some hotspots across Britain. Airbnb has disputed the finding.Meanwhile, an organisation representing landlords has warned that imminent tax changes will drive an increasing number of landlords towards Airbnb and its rivals, depriving renters of long-term, stable tenancies.Last month Lucas asked the government to make it easier for councils to impose a 90-day cap on homes let out on Airbnb and other online platforms.

A tax on short-term lets is also being considered.“Brighton and Hove city council should be given the powers to regulate this industry, which is having such a serious impact on an already overstretched private rental sector and on more highly regulated hotels and B\u0026ampBs, which are being undercut. There needs to be a level playing field,” said Lucas.“The pressure put on the availability of local housing by Airbnb in some areas of UK is intolerable. Local councils must be given powers to regulate this, so local housing needs are not squeezed out,” she tweeted on Friday.Airbnb said the ’s data was flawed and that some listings were for hotel rooms, single rooms in homes, and unusual properties such as caravans, meaning their rental did not affect housing stock.Patrick Robinson, the company’s director of public policy, said: “Airbnb is a good partner to cities and we were the first platform to limit how often hosts in London can share their homes. We are also working with cities across the UK on proposals for a host registration system that we will proactively put to the government later this year to help ensure that rules work for everyone.”But some critics of the company in hotspot areas say the saturation of their neighbourhoods is changing their way of life. Chris Hayes, a 55-year-old train driver who lives in the North Laine area of Brighton, said his life was being made a misery because five of the 29 cottages in his row were being advertised on Airbnb and similar sites.“Residents have no way of stopping noise without confrontation. The owners are unknown or uncontactable, the ‘hosts’ do not have contact numbers for out-of-office hours, the council does not have noise abatement officers at night, the police treat it as very low priority,” he said, complaining of being woken by parties and the sound of suitcases being trundled along the alleyway in the middle of the night.He added: “Airbnbs should be a planning change of use from residential. You need a change of use to convert a home to an office, hotel or shop. Why not to Airbnb?”The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) warned on Friday that renters were finding it harder to access long-term homes to rent because taxation changes are driving landlords to move into the holiday lettings market.Last month, research from ARLA Propertymark found that nearly half a million UK properties could be left unavailable for longer-term rent as more landlords exit the market in favour of short-term lettings. Many landlords blame the government for restricting mortgage interest relief to the basic rate of income tax, claiming they will be significantly worse off or even unable to make a profit on their lettings.David Smith, the RLA’s policy director, said: “Government policy is actively encouraging the growth of holiday homes at the expense of long-term homes to rent, which many families need. This is completely counterproductive, making renting more expensive and undermining efforts to help tenants save for a house of their own.“The chancellor must use his budget to give tenants a better deal by supporting good landlords to provide the homes to rent that they want to live in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7a1505e6e205c554869b2563cc15a8063d8621a/0_19_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28af0417c608edca7cd9a405358d6c3c","title":"its good humoured derry girls blackboard moves to ulster museum","story":"List of supposed Catholic and Protestant traits is part of exhibition on Northern Irish identityProtestants have horses and keep toasters in cupboards, while Catholics love statues and keep coal in the bath.

Her series Nightshade, combines portraits with botanical images of the tomato plant and the subjects’ recipesThe English word tomato derives from the Aztec word tomatl. It is believed the Aztecs and Incas were cultivating and eating the tomato from 700AD. Though the tomato originated from the Andean region, it eventually spread north to Mexico. The scientific name for the tomato is solanum lycoperscicum.While the Spanish were responsible for bringing the tomato to Europe in the early 16th century, its first reference in Italy was in 1544 in Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s Herbal, who refers to the tomato as pomi d’oro meaning golden apple. The tomato was not used in cooking until the 18th century as it was often viewed with fear and suspicion as a member of the nightshade plant family, which had plants such as the mandrake among them.Once the names the tomato were called were amended and confusion and ambiguity as to what it was subsided, it was able to illustrate its full potential. After its family ties became less relevant and it was allowed to exist for what it was, not how it looked, it thrived. This took an element of trust.Below, Nightshade’s subjects discuss their favourite recipes.I can tell you, lasagna is the first dish I learned to cook. I moved out from my parents’ house without knowing how to cook even a common pasta but since lasagna and pollo con patate, are my favourite dishes, I learned how to cook them first. Even though making the ragu isn’t so easy. I tried my best and my lasagna is one of the best in town, if you get in Brianza by any chance, you’ve got to taste it.Fry the onion until softened. Add the carrot and cook for five minutes, then add the celery and cook for another two minutes. Turn up the heat, add the chopped beef and cook until browned all over.Make a ragu over an afternoon, pour in the wine and passata, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of grated nutmeg, then bring to a simmer.Make your own béchamel. Place cooked ragu into an overproof dish and layer. Top with parmesan. Garnish with basil.This is a classic Italian recipe. If you ever jump on a plane to Italy, don’t miss it.Since I was a child, this has been my favourite recipe. I remember cooking it for every family party, even for my sister’s wedding. With this recipe you will never go too far wrong. Your guests will love Crostata. This recipe is a mix of authentic Italian flavours, in which lemon and marmellata (jam) are the main ingredients for a unique and refined taste.Good luck and enjoy!Ingredients: 250g cold butter from the fridge | 200g of icing sugar | 500g of 00 flour | 2 eggs | The rind of an untreated lemon | 400g of jam | Enough milk to brush the surface | A pinch of saltPut the flour, butter and a pinch of salt in the mixer. Mix in order to obtain an uneven sandblasting.Add the eggs, icing sugar and lemon peel to flavour the pastry and allow the citric acid to make it crumbly.Knead the dough before putting it onto a work surface. Start working it with the fingertips, to create a nice compact dough. Wrap it in clingfilm and let it rest for 30 minutes in the fridge, or ideally overnight.After letting the dough rest, we heat it and flatten it. Aim for a thickness of 78mm. Transfer the dough into a 24cm diameter cake pan and pinch the bottom with a fork.Then we make our short pastry with jam, we distribute it on the edge. After that, prepare 3 or 4cm strips of dough and place on to the jam, applying pressure to the edges. Lay the strips diagonally creating a grid of pastry and diamond shapes of jam. To make the tart shiny, brush the milk on the pastry with a pastry brush. After that, we bake the tart in a pre-heated oven at 170C for 50 minutes.Fiorentina is one of the most popular and biggest steak in Italian cuisine.I have eaten this more than three times and its taste was undeniable. I think it is one of the best dishes that I often have because it reminds me of Tuscany’s fabulous and iconic lifestyle.Use the highest quality steak, ideally Tuscan or Italian. Cook on an open fire if possible (on the embers of the grill). Rare or medium rare only. Garnish with salt and pepper.Pizza has always been a reason to gather with my friends. Pizzerias were fancy enough for our student pockets. When my mum would make pizza at home, we were always very excited.For me, it was nice to see the first generation of immigrants learning the Italian cooking as their way of integration.Ingredients: Semolina pizza dough | tablespoon olive oil | 2 cloves chopped garlic | 5 mushrooms thinly sliced | mozzarella cheese | 1 can tomatoes | chopped roma | 1 bell pepper| thinly sliced prosciutto | salt \u0026amp pepper to taste | oregano | pepper flakesPreheat oven to its hottest setting for 45 minutes. With about 1 teaspoon olive oil, sauté the sliced mushrooms and a pinch of salt over medium heat for 5-10 minutes, until well browned. Set aside.Sprinkle semolina on your baking sheet. Place the dough on top of the semolina and roll out into a circular shape. Brush the outer edges with olive oil and chopped garlic. Spread chopped tomatoes from the centre out to the edge of the oiled crust.Evenly place your toppings (mushrooms, mozzarella, bell pepper, etc) on the dough. Sprinkle with salt, Italian seasoning and pepper flakes, to taste. Add Parmesan cheese if desired.Transfer the pizza onto your stone by sliding it off the baking sheet. Bake for 10+ minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and the cheese is bubbly. Remove with tongs and let rest for five minutes.I usually cook it during summer for lunch, after a long morning at the beach. It is easy, quick and everyone loves it, including my kids. The pepper is not that hot. It is a plate that I particularly love because I buy the shrimps fresh from the local fish store near the beach.Ingredients: Shrimps from Marsala Tomatoes from pachino | 300g spaghetti | Olive oil | Garlic | Hot pepper | SaltIn a frying pan add some oil, garlic and hot pepper then mix all together until the mixture becomes a little golden. In the meantime, boil some water for the pasta.Add two or three tablespoons of the boiling water into the mixture. Then let it sit for a couple of minutes until the pasta is cooked. Add salt and pepper. Mix everything together.Aubergines are my all-time favourite late summerwinter vegetable. This dish reminds me of childhood, having a family meal at a local tavola calda. It can be eaten as a standalone dish or as part of a secondo piatto. It’s one of the most unassuming yet deliciously hearty dishes. I’ve probably adulterated the dish to suit my palette but this is a firm favourite for me to prepare for my nearest and dearest. If you want a leaner version of this dish, try grilling the aubergines instead. An exceptionally tasty vegetarian treat.Ingredients: 3 large aubergines | 1 bottle of tomato passata | 2 cloves of garlic 2 balls of mozzarella | 1 cup of parmigiano reggiano (grated) | 1 cup of extra virgin olive oil | 1 cup flour | 1 cup vegetable oil | Black pepper to taste | Fresh basil to taste | Salt to tastePreheat oven to 180C (356F). Slice aubergines lengthways but leave skin on. Place in a bowl and sprinkle two tablespoons of salt over them and leave for an hour to remove the moisture.In the meantime prepare the sauce. Add two teaspoons of olive oil to a pan and finely chop garlic cloves. Fry until softened. Add passata and cook on medium heat on hob for 15 minutes. Tear and add fresh basil and black pepper and salt. Cook for a further 10 minutes. Chop mozzarella into small cubes.Place flour into a bowl. Take aubergines out of salt and coat each in the flour. Prepare a new pan with two tablespoons vegetable oil and fry off flour coated aubergines- about 1-2 minutes each side. Place on kitchen towel to absorb oil. Add more cooking oil to pan if required.Prepare an oven baking dish. Start by spoon- ing some of the passata onto the base. Then place a layer of aubergines on top, add some passata, parmesan and mozzarella. Repeat until all ingredients have been used.Bake for 25-30 minutes. Serve with a sprig of basil and enjoy this heart-warming beautiful dish.This is a classic Italian antipasto. It is the perfect dish for when you invite your friend for dinner because it is easy to make and very tasty.Slice mozzarella and tomato and place on plate. Apply a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt, pepper and fresh oregano.This dish reminds me of the long summers in my childhood, and I used to enjoy this on a picnic or by the beach. It brings memories of laughs, sun, water, running barefoot in the hot sand, beach games and the joy of eating all together.Ingredients: 4-5 medium firm ripe round tomatoes seeded and hollowed out | 1 cup uncooked rice (I used long grain par boiled) 185 grams | 1 teaspoon oregano 12 gram | 1 teaspoon basil 12 gram | 12 teaspoon salt 2 12 grams | 12 gram *6 springs fresh chopped Italian parsley | 1 clove garlic chopped | 14 - 12 cup chopped tomato pulp 55-82 grams | 2-3 tablespoons olive oilPre-heat oven to 180C (375F) and lightly oil a large baking pan. In a medium bowl add rice and cover with water, allowing it soak for one hour, then drain and rinse.Rinse and dry tomatoes, carefully cut off top of tomato and set aside. Remove seed and pulp from the tomatoes, set aside the pulp and discard the seeds.In a medium bowl mix chopped tomato pulp, oregano, salt, parsley, garlic, 2-3 tablespoons (45 grams) olive oil and rice. Fill hollowed out tomatoes with mixture. Place tops back on tomatoes, sprinkle tomatoes with a little salt and drizzle with olive oil.Add roasted potatoes with rosemary and bake for approximately 45- 60 minutes or until potatoes and rice are tender. Serve immediately. Enjoy.This is my favourite dish for three reasons: though based on rather basic ingredients, it is unabashedly rich and indulgent its reddishorangey colours evoke those of my favourite team (AS Roma), and you can do an excellent version of it in under 30 minutes.Ingredients: Guanciale (cured Italian pig cheek. Do not use pancetta in any circumstance) | Pecorino Romano (abundant) | Tomato passata Calabrian chili | Salt | Pepper | Rigatoni or bucatini | WineDice the guanciale into thin strips. Remember to remove the hard part of the skin, and to slice off a bit of fat if the ratio of meat to fat is less than 1:3. Add to a non-stick pan at medium heat and let it heat gently until the guanciale is crispy and the fat renders.Add a splash of dry white wine (like a frascati), to deglaze the pan. This step is optional. Once the alcohol has evaporated, add some flakes of chilli and a high-quality tomato passata (or blended chopped tomatoes). Add some seasoning (but not too much salt), and let it simmer on a medium heat.In the meantime, bring water to the boil, and add either rigatoni (short pasta) or bucatini, depending on your (and guests’) preference. Tip: growing up I was always told that the water of the pasta must be as salty as the Mediterranean. Few things are more upsetting than an under-salted pasta. So be generous when salting the boiling water for pasta. Two minutes before the pasta is ready, set aside some of the starchy boiling water, and then quickly decant and add to the sauce.Another tip: always toss pasta into sauce, not vice versa. The pasta is at its most absorbent in the 10 seconds after it has been drained, so don’t waste time in mixing it with the sauce. As you toss it in, add in generous heaps of grated pecorino cheese, which should gently melt. This renders the sauce less red but also thicker. Use the water set aside to regulate the consistency. A good amatriciana must have a touch of sleepiness to it.Plate - on a heated plate preferably, add some grated pecorino and buon appetito."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6e2ec908e7f900d6d7dbaba09b01589fffa4ff/0_263_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24580e4ae5c568de59d918ab9102f82","title":"post apocalyptic how coronavirus has altered day to day life wuhan north england","story":"From Wuhan to the north of England, people have been affected by the outbreak in different waysThe coronavirus is a public health emergency, but its threat is not only medical. Millions of lives have been altered by the outbreak, from those in self-isolation in China to Chinese nationals experiencing racism abroad. We talk to those affected in different ways, from Wuhan to the north of England.Wi, a 29-year-old Chinese PhD student in the Midlands, is originally from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak and where her parents have been in self-quarantine for more than 20 days. “They can’t walk, they can’t leave their own flat – it’s not a holiday, it’s like jail,” she said. “They are unable to even open windows for fear that the virus will spread through the air.“Now the whole of Wuhan is closed, all public transport and private cars have been stopped, so they can’t even drive their own cars on the road. So they just stay at home, eating, sleeping and watching movies. That’s all they can do,” Wi said.Wi’s parents have not been told when they will be allowed to leave their flat. Wi has become concerned about the mental health of those in isolation in the city, after seeing posts on social media with locals saying they would rather kill themselves than remain in quarantine any longer.“The biggest enemy is not the virus, it’s mental health. When you stay in one room for half a month, that’s horrible, you cannot go outside or get fresh air.”A hundred miles from Wuhan, nestled in the countryside of Hubei province, British teacher Claude* is in self-isolation with his Chinese girlfriend and her family in her hometown, which the pair were visiting for the lunar new year.“After a day or two it became a ghost town,” Claude, 46, said. “The first week I was just relaxing – I work near Hong Kong so this was my holiday. I thought I would have more cabin fever by now, but I’m actually pretty fine. My girlfriends’s family are cooking lots and cleaning for us, so I’m being spoilt.” He described the town as “post-apocalyptic”, with speakers playing American swing music on empty streets, and men in biohazard suits checking people’s temperatures before they enter Walmart. He and his girlfriend still do not know when they will be allowed to leave. But when they finally return to their home in Shenzhen, they will be required to undergo another two weeks in quarantine.Claude said the mood in the town was “pretty chilled out”, but feared this could change in coming weeks as supplies run low. “As the days go on, more people are wearing masks, and people are standing further and further apart,” he said.In neighbouring Hunan province, Yuhan, a 28-year-old Chinese national who lives and works in Melbourne, is also trapped, after returning to visit her family for the new year.She has been in self-quarantine with her parents for 29 days, leaving only to visit her grandmother who lives 200 metres away. Yuhan worries that the isolation could last another two weeks.The family order groceries online once every two or three days, and spend most of their time cooking and watching TV. They usually go to her grandmother’s for lunch and leave food for her dinner. But Yuhan said many of her friends’ families would not leave the house at all.“My grandma keeps wanting to go out for walks, especially when it’s sunny, but I always try to stop her and walk around the apartment with her,” she said. “It is sometimes hard to explain to my grandma how dangerous things still are, as official news on TV is mainly good news.”In the country’s most populous city, Shanghai, many foreign teachers are beginning to fear for their jobs.Rob, a 23-year-old teacher at an international kindergarten in the city, said about 25 other teachers had lost their jobs during the outbreak, after parents refused to send their children back to school for their final term. This has left the teachers with just 30 days to find work before their visas expire.“The worrying thing is that once these teachers have their work visas cancelled, their medical insurance goes too,” he said. “The school has said they can’t do anything – they need to lay them off because the profit margins are too tight, and it’s illegal not to cancel their visas if they’re not working.”Rob could not fly home to the UK as planned, so instead flew to Bangkok. Now back in Shanghai, he told of people being charged £6 for face masks, and others having to go without if they missed the daily registration for them. He had also been warned of landlords taking their tenants’ allocation of masks, claiming that as homeowners, the masks given to each household should go to them.Some people who have travelled through China have criticised airline checks designed to prevent the spread of the virus. Dave* was on holiday in Bangkok with his partner and travelled back to the UK via Beijing with Air China, wearing face masks and swimming goggles.Airline staff took the temperatures of passengers at Bangkok, where four people “blatantly tested far above the threshold” but were allowed to board after short arguments with flight attendants, said the 39-year-old. “My partner and I both thought the flight was tense, and the flight crew were visibly nervous on both sides. Some people didn’t seem too fussed about it, and I got the impression that a lot of people were half-hearted, like wearing masks that weren’t properly over their face.”At Heathrow, there were no checks or information. “It was just like flying to Heathrow on any other day,” he said. “I was expecting at least some information on contacting Public Health England, but there weren’t even any posters. Us and a litany of sick coughing people from an Air China flight waltzed right out the airport.“There was hand sanitiser everywhere but no one seemed to use it,” he added. “I felt it was all a bit half-arsed.”Back in the UK, the Chinese community are feeling the effects of the virus. Lee*, a Chinese PhD student in the north of England, was subjected to racist abuse on a night out because of the coronavirus. He said he and two Chinese friends were on their way to a shopping centre one evening when three men in a car began shouting at them. “They called us ‘Chinese virus’ and ‘you Chinese bastards’,” Lee said.“We were really afraid. We passed them quickly and we kept silent because we were scared they might do something violent. There was nobody else out on the street and we wanted to stay safe. It felt very dangerous at the time.”Lee said that since the incident he has stayed at home more, only going out for university meetings or shopping for food. He feels that since the outbreak cultural differences are causing issues. The British do not tend to wear face masks but it is normal for Asian people, he said. “Now my Chinese friends get stared at for wearing them.” *Some names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66e49928e30bd5e462044bfcc6c3f51fe502af5d/0_527_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fae3b118099e9802f1e720f718c51f0","title":"rome unveil shrine city mythical founder romulus","story":"A newly discovered ancient shrine believed to have been dedicated to the cult of Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, has been unveiled.The monument was discovered by archaeologists in a chamber beneath the Roman Forum, the political heart of the Roman empire, and includes a 2,600-year-old sarcophagus and a circular stone structure that is believed to have been an altar.The discovery was made close to the Curia-Comitium complex, where senators would meet to vote, as part of an excavation project that began last year.In Roman mythology, Romulus founded the city after killing his twin brother, Remus. Legend also has it that he was murdered by angry senators and his body dismembered.The existence of Romulus is disputed by historians. Alfonsina Russo, the director of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, which manages the Roman Forum, said on Friday that the tomb was not his final resting place. No bones were found inside the sarcophagus.“It is not the tomb of Romulus but a place of memory where the cult of Romulus was celebrated, a cenotaph,” Russo said. “It is also not his tomb, as some sources say that Romulus was killed and cut into pieces, while others say he was taken up to heaven as god Quirinus.”However, Russo believes there is some truth in the legend: “All legends and myths have a kernel of truth and I am convinced there was a founding hero.”Romulus and Remus were said to have been the sons of Rhea Silvia, a vestal virgin and daughter of the former king Numitor, and the war god, Mars.As babies, they were thrown into the River Tiber in a cradle by their uncle, before being saved by a she-wolf. The symbol of Rome features a she-wolf suckling Romulus and Remus.Romulus is said to have killed Remus on what became the Palatine Hill after quarrelling over where to build Rome. It is said he went on to found the Roman senate and rule as king for almost 40 years, before vanishing one day when visiting his troops.The discovery of the shrine was praised by the city’s mayor, Virginia Raggi, who tweeted this week: “Rome always marvels with its treasures.”The shrine will be open to visitors in about two years."},{"url":null,"title":"mv alta the unmanned voyage of the ballycotton ghost ship","story":"A winter afternoon run along a desolate cliff top pathway is as good a time as any to see a ghost. Last Sunday, Barry McDonald could feel the gale at his back. He regularly jogs this rugged strip of Co Cork coastline between Ballyandreen and Ballycotton but the previous day it had been under siege by storm and blustering winds.About 200 yards out along the cliff path his eye caught something over his right shoulder. As he turned he saw a hulk of white rusted metal pitched along the crags of a half-mile-wide cove.“It just came into view as I ran along the cliff,” he says of the MV Alta, the so-called “ghost ship” whose prolonged disappearance on the high seas came to an end at that moment. “I could see it was up on the rocks but I couldn’t understand how it was there.”McDonald was astonished by its sudden appearance, at a spot between the locally known Skur and Ceann Capaill rock. “I was thinking, had it happened during the week and nobody told me about it? Was I not around?”It was all the more unusual for McDonald, an RNLI volunteer whose network of contacts would surely have heard about such a major nautical event on their doorstep. They hadn’t. McDonald ran on from the cliff walk and quickly rang the Coast Guard.In the week since, the story of the mysterious arrival of the abandoned 77-metre (250ft) cargo ship has been recounted around the world. Those claiming to own the vessel have made contact with the authorities and the long process of resolving its ultimate fate is now under way.Its emergence on the rocky Cork shore concludes a lonely trans-Atlantic journey of about 17 months. The unmanned voyage of the Tanzanian flagged Alta began in October, 2018. Its 10-strong crew had been adrift in the wild Atlantic for three weeks, unable to make repairs and running out of food, and had to be rescued by the US Coast Guard’s Cutter Confidence about 1,380 nautical miles southeast of Bermuda.Little has been reported about the ship’s activities at this time. One marine source, however, remarks that its ambitious voyage from Greece to Haiti – a distance of almost 5,000 nautical miles – was not in keeping with its size and design. This class of boat is more likely to be engaged in “near continental trade”, a term that refers to boats hugging coastlines in specific areas such as the Mediterranean or Persian Gulf.The following July, long after its crew had been plucked to safety, an unverified report emerged in the Maritime Bulletin suggesting the ship may have been towed toward Guyana in South America before being hijacked and abandoned for a second time.That is uncertain, but what is definite is that its next confirmed sighting was by the icebreaker HMS Protector, the Royal Navy’s scientific research ship, in August or September 2019. It never released an exact location. The Protector attempted to make contact with a crew that was no longer there and eventually sailed away.“It’s rare that something of this size would be wandering around for a long time but it does happen, and this won’t be the last,” explains Cormac Gebruers, head of college at the National Maritime College of Ireland in Cork.The idea of a large steel ship floating around unnoticed for months on end is a difficult one for many to take in. But, as Gebruers explains, the vastness of the oceans is not always easy to process.“Something even the size of a 77-metre steel vessel – when you drop it into the centre of the Atlantic Ocean, it’s a very large area. It’s not unusual, if it dropped out of regularly travelled shipping lanes, that it wouldn’t be sighted for many months.”Even in shipping lanes, a typical distance between large vessels is often in the order of 50-100 miles. They don’t see each other.As a former navigator on super tankers sailing between the Persian Gulf and the US, Gebruers would often travel the leg between Capetown, South Africa and the Caribbean via the south Atlantic. Over the course of three weeks they might spot two other ships. The oceans are vast.The most likely scenario for the Alta after its abandonment in the Atlantic was that it got snagged in the Gulf Stream, and was pushed up along the northeast coast of the US and Canada and then northeast across the Atlantic towards the Irish coast.In August 2019, an article in the trade Merco Press reported the HMS Protector was in Middlesbrough for maintenance work. The following month she was due to sail for the Bahamas for disaster relief efforts.The Protector’s precise whereabouts when it sighted the Alta are unknown, but Gebruers says a reasonable hypothesis is that she was sailing southwest when she encountered the Alta in the mid-Atlantic.“She would probably have passed through the Azores, so there’s a good chance she would have run into the Alta somewhere about 700 miles southwest of Ireland,” he says. “That position is about 500 miles northwest of the Azores which is kind of about where you would expect something floating from the Gulf Stream and into the North Atlantic Drift to be.”Based on those assumptions, Gebruers reckons the Alta would have drifted about four nautical miles a day at an approximate speed of 0.2 knots.The romantic notion of a ghost ship lurching aimlessly, endlessly on the ocean swells quickly disappears when it runs aground. At sea, the Alta would have been a silent, foreboding monster. In the cold daylight of the southern Irish coast, however, she is quickly reduced to the reality of a rusting hull of peeling paint, with a lingering smell of diesel.This week, in keeping with procedure on washed-up ships, an officer of the Revenue Commissioners was appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Minister of Transport – essentially custodian of the whole mess.This function, under the Merchant Shipping (Salvage \u0026amp Wreck) Act, 1993, is designed to apply legal process to managing the ship’s carcass, and the costs associated with doing so. It is with this office the Alta’s apparent owners would have made contact, and their bona fides are currently under review.Several owners have been registered for the vessel the last change of hands appears to have occurred in 2017. With the complexities of maritime law, actual ship owners can be difficult to ascertain amid a complex weave of registered, often international companies.Those claiming to own the Alta have not been identified by Irish authorities. Why they have come forward to claim the ship now is unclear. Nobody can know for certain although, according to Darren Lehane, a barrister specialising in maritime law, there is no legal responsibility on anyone to deal with an empty vessel in the middle of nowhere.“There are a lot more vessels out there than people think. A lot of small boats don’t have to be registered.”All kinds are left on the ebb and flow of the world’s oceans, he says – official counts put the number anywhere between 6,000 and 9,000 every year.Sometimes they are set adrift because of shady activity (drug trafficking) sometimes because their owners simply no longer want them or can’t afford them. Sometimes they simply break down and are not worth fixing. Few, however, are the size of the Alta.Ian Urbina, the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and author of The Outlaw Ocean, a detailed examination of illegal practices at sea, says the Alta case first and foremost raises questions about its former crew.“What were the conditions that led them to stay on a ship that was broken down for three weeks?” he wonders. “And also, what fate has befallen them since they were rescued?”Urbina points out that apart from some troubled waters in certain parts of the world, comparable cases of large empty vessels floating aimlessly are not common.In Ireland, Lehane says the number of such cases in which a Receiver of Wrecks is appointed is probably relatively few. Those that do occur are usually linked to storms.The Department of Transport says instances in recent years “arise infrequently and many of these are low-value, small abandoned boats or parts thereof washed ashore, with no pollution risks”. No financial information regarding costs is available.In such cases, where wrecks are spotted they must be reported to the Receiver (in reality, this means the authorities). “If a treasure chest washes up ashore, you can’t just take it,” explains Lehane.As an extension of centuries’ old maritime logic, the notion of those who rescue boats before they come to harm being rewarded for their efforts has continued in modern law.As for the Alta, while it may consist of relatively worthless scrap metal and a bit of diesel, no third party has a claim because she washed up on the rocks. Her case falls under the law of derelict ships.In these circumstances owners are encouraged to provide financial security for costs and their proof of ownership quickly in order to keep costs down. They are entitled to the return of their property only when they have settled any outstanding fees and expenses, in this case to the State.Time is ticking. Earlier this week, a marine salvage expert warned that while an operation to remove the ship was a relatively easy task for now, it would become more difficult and more expensive. There are also environmental concerns and no matter how downplayed they may be, pressure will build for as long as the hull is allowed to fester.On Tuesday morning the boots of Cork County Council contractors stomped through the empty decks to begin inspecting conditions onboard, probably the first human activity in many months. Plans are being drawn up, the owners are engaged the 2,300 tonnes of steel will one day leave this small Cork inlet one way or another.In the meantime, as Barry McDonald jogs near the ongoing salvage operation in the weeks ahead, he will be thinking about his small role at the centre of a story that this region has seen play out before. History is repeating itself.Almost exactly 125 years ago, about two miles west of the site of the Alta, another ghost ship came to haunt the east Cork shoreline. In February, 1895 the remains of the Swedish brig Saga were discovered at Kelly’s Cove. Derelict and rudderless, not a single person was found aboard.Mark Hilliard is a news reporter with The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoWhat if we gave people food that was better for them \u0026ndash wouldn\u0026rsquot they get better faster?\u0026rsquoLimerick man Jason Corbett murdered in North Carolina home in 2015 as he sleptA number of Fianna F\u0026aacuteil TDs uneasy about Miche\u0026aacutel Martin\u0026rsquos speech regarding Sinn F\u0026eacuteinNew garda\u0026iacute bring to 14,467 the number of sworn members in the forceBrandon Lewis and T\u0026aacutenaiste meet for first time at Stormont House in BelfastSituation so bad those attending at her home had to use face masks and protective clothingMaterials stored in barrels scheduled to be removed by helicopter after being securedFine Gael focuses on electing Senators in constituencies with no party representationJeffrey Crowley has 92 previous convictions many involving \u0026lsquogratuitous violence\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos worst area is coming in last on environmental index out of 15 member statesUniversity Hospital Galway says kitchen will open \u0026lsquoas quickly as possible\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoDemocracy is the order of the day . . . there\u0026rsquos no dispute around that\u0026rsquo, says SF leaderPanel of independent contractors - self employed barristers - assisted with applicationsJudge will finish charging jury following six-week trialMan pleaded not guilty to 23 counts of sexually assaulting four girls in 2015 and 2016Four to be charged with causing serious harm to Quinn Industrial Holdings directorIgor Lewandowski (20) to be sentenced in May after risk of future offending assessedContractor working in Kilmainham allegedly circulated images of Garda bulletin boardOliver Callely, son of Ivor, ordered to perform community service in lieu of prison sentenceThe 295 winners in the Cavan parish of Drumgoon include former GAA president Aog\u0026aacuten \u0026Oacute FearghailStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181078.1582313182!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk commitments on legacy issues must be honoured coveney tells new ni secretary","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tActing Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he and new NI Secretary Brandon Lewis had a ‘good’ and ‘cordial’ meeting in Belfast on Friday. File photograph Nick Bradshaw the Commitments on legacy in the North must be implemented in full, the acting Tánaiste has told the new Northern Secretary during their first meeting. Simon Coveney and Brandon Lewis met for the first time at Stormont House on Friday. Mr Lewis was appointed last week after his predecessor as Northern Secretary, Julian Smith, was sacked by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, weeks after reaching the deal which restored the North’s power-sharing Assembly. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Mr Coveney said they had a “good” and “cordial” meeting and Mr Lewis was someone who was “easy to talk to and get along with.” He said that, as had been the case with Mr Lewis’ predecessor, “it’s really important that the two governments work together closely on a lot of very awkward and difficult political issues.” He said he had spoken to Mr Lewis about the need to implement the legacy provisions of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement. Mr Coveney and Mr Lewis also discussed the progress made by the North’s Executive and Assembly since its restoration last month, as well as the future negotiations over the relationship between the EU and the UK and the unique position and challenges faced by Northern Ireland now the UK has left the EU. The New Decade, New Approach document, which restored power-sharing in Northern Ireland, includes a commitment to bring forward legislation to do so within 100 days. Historical Investigations UnitAmong these measures is the creation of a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU), a new, independent body which will investigate outstanding Troubles-related deaths. “A number of the domestic challenges here in Northern Ireland I think are going to be very challenging for the new Secretary of State,” said Mr Coveney, “and I want to work with him on that, in particular in relation to legacy, the legacy of the past, how we deal with that. “We have an agreement of course, the British and Irish Governments in Stormont House, And I spoke to him today about the need to implement that agreement in full and I think we’re going to work on that,” he said.”During his first visit to Northern Ireland as Northern Secretary last week, Mr Lewis said the UK government was “absolutely committed” to implementing the New Decade, New Approach deal. On Friday, Mr Lewis also met the family of murdered Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. Mr Finucane was shot dead in 1989 by loyalist paramilitaries who were working in collusion with the security forces. Twelve months ago the Supreme Court ruled that investigations into Mr Finucane’s murder had not been effective and fell short of international human rights standards. Speaking to reporters afterward their meeting with Mr Lewis, Mr Finucane’s his widow Geraldine said they had come “to hear the response of the government and what they intend to do. “We did not hear anything from the government. They have not made up their mind what they’re going to do. “The Secretary of State has said he has a report to read and when he has read that he will speak to the Prime Minister and they will make a decision in the case. “He said that will happen in a matter of weeks, not months. I hope that is the case,” she said. Mrs Finucane added that while Mr Lewis had not made the excuse that he was new in the job, “we did point out that in the past year there have been three Secretary of States and no decision has been made and it’s about time.” Her son John, the Sinn Féin MP for North Belfast, said that while the family was “no further on” in regard to a response from the British government, “we have been given a commitment that their response will be forthcoming within weeks. “We have been through this for 31 years so we will judge, if and when, the response comes within those weeks,” he said.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsEmer Higgins of Fine Gael is one of 48 new TDs in the Dáil, for whom Thursday was their first day. The atmosphere was definitely celebratory and a little giddy, with the new TDs like college graduates, or maybe freshers. Many beamed with pride, all surrounded by relatives and friends on what was an auspicious day for them.Higgins, representing Dublin Mid-West, had recently handed in her notice at PayPal where she worked for six years. She had worked in Leinster House for five years, for the then-tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.“It is so different coming back as here as a TD,” she said, her excitement tempered by nervousness at having to make the speech seconding Leo Varadkar’s nomination as Taoiseach.Another newcomer was Claire Kerrane, Sinn Féin TD for Roscommon-Galway. She has worked on policy for Sinn Féin for the past number of the years, commuting home to Ballaghaderreen every weekend.Leinster House was also familiar to her but, nevertheless, “it was very surreal. Even sitting there and seeing all the TDs up close.”Like Higgins, she says she will focus on local issues as her priority initially. On a wider level, she believes the Fianna Fáil leadership is not in lockstep with its grassroots given its refusal to deal with Sinn Féin.Defied expectationsHolly Cairns has defied expectations twice in a short political career. Last May she took an unexpected seat on Cork County Council for the Social Democrats by one vote, and in this month’s election she won a seat for her party in Cork South-West. Her grandparents were with her.“People asked me did I feel nervous. But it does not feel at all strange. It is a very exciting time for the Social Democrats.”Norma Foley of Fianna Fáil is the daughter of a former TD for Kerry. “The old building is the same and that reminds us of the longevity of the Dáil and its history,” she said.“For me today was very daunting. I was aware of of all those who have gone before. It’s an absolute honour and I’m very glad of the opportunity that has been given me by the people of Kerry.”Already restlessGreen Party TD Neasa Hourigan said she was already restless to be getting on with the process of nominating a government.“I understand there are the theatrics of this but there are more important things to do. We should start the talks process immediately and begin the process of locking people into agreements.”She said the talks should be open-ended, counterintuitive, and with absolutely zero red lines.“We have never suggested anything in housing, health or climate change will be done inexpensively. All will need a huge up-front capital investment. That is really challenging. But we have to move there. And move there quickly.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Mr Martin said Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald had “praised Provisional IRA units”.But Fianna Fáil sources said it was necessary to convince other parties, such as the Greens, that Fianna Fáil would not enter government with Ms McDonald.In a sign of the tensions within Fianna Fáil, a number of party sources said frontbenchers had raised the prospect of changing leader before entering government, although this was not seen as a credible option.Sinn Féin Waterford TD David Cullinane said his party would continue its efforts to build a left-wing alliance.“What we are trying to do is make it more about the issues and that will put it up to the others, including those on the left,” he said, adding that this would make it more difficult for left-wing parties to join a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael coalition.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Getty ImagesAfter two postponements and right on the cusp of a key deadline feuding South Sudanese leaders Salva Kiir and Riek Machar are set to form a unity government. It is a move the long-suffering citizens hope can pave the way to lasting piece.While many specifics are still to be resolved, including security arrangements, the country’s president, Mr Kiir, said Mr Machar – who lives in exile – would be appointed his vice-president, and they would form the government on Saturday.Mr Kiir has also said a dispute over how many states there should be in South Sudan would be resolved later.South Sudan gained independence in 2011, but celebrations turned into a nightmare two years later when the country erupted into a brutal civil war. It was triggered when Mr Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, fired Mr Machar, then his deputy and a member of the Nuer ethnic group.Roughly 400,000 people are believed to have died in the ensuing violence. More than 2 million have fled the country, and another 1.4 are internally displaced.Saturday had been set as the latest date for the opposing leaders to form a unity government after two previous deadlines were missed. These were agreed initially under a peace deal signed in 2018.“This is a major step forward,” Alan Boswell, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, told The  about the latest announcement. “This was the only path forward, though it remains a troubled one.”Mr Boswell was speaking from South Sudan’s capital Juba, where he said things were very quiet. “There is not nearly the tension that prefaced the failed unity government of 2016.”On Thursday a United Nations commission of human rights released a report condemning both sides of the conflict. It spoke about a “sustained lack of political will” among the signatories of the peace deal, while accusing the government of plundering resources and accusing both sides of forcibly recruiting children. Sexual violence“Sexual and gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, continued to be widespread and pervasive,”said the report. “Meanwhile more than 55 per cent of civilians countrywide, mainly women and children, faced acute food insecurity due to wilful impediments of humanitarian aid by different parties, climate-induced factors and large-scale conflict-induced displacement.”In a statement to journalists in Nairobi, commission chairman Yasmin Sooka said “human rights violations, including rape and sexual violence, continue and may amount to war crimes”.She said the commission was alarmed by the number of recent executions, and that “documenting incidents of rapes, gang rapes, sexual mutilation, abductions and sexual slavery, as well as killings has become quite normalised in South Sudan”.Ms Sooka urged both the South Sudanese government and the wider international community to push for an end to conflict. “The people of South Sudan deserve a chance to build their lives in peace and security.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181023.1582309545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democratic candidates prepare to roll the dice in las vegas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg speaks with a member of the Culinary Workers’ Union on a picket line outside the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Photograph: Mario TamaGetty ImagesAs the political world descended on Las Vegas ahead of this weekend’s Nevada caucuses, life in the state’s most famous city continued as normal.On Wednesday, six Democratic nominees and their entourages took over the Paris Las Vegas hotel for the ninth Democratic debate. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s motorcade was whisking the president to the Trump hotel that peers over the Las Vegas skyline ahead of his rally yesterday.\u0026nbspAs swarms of police cars blocked off huge chunks of the Las Vegas strip, bemused revellers and feathered showgirls looked on in curiosity, their interest temporarily erted from the non-stop street life taking place around them.Las Vegas may be known as America’s adult playground, but it is also plays an increasingly important role in state and national politics. Nevada is the third state in the country to select its primary candidate, a status that has become particularly important this year given the lack of a standout winner in the Iowa and New Hampshire contests.It is also the most erse of the early voting states, its ethnic make-up more reflective of the country – and particularly the Democratic electorate. About 30 per cent of the state is Hiic, with African Americans representing 9 per cent of the population.Demographic trendLas Vegas is central to this demographic trend. The city in the southern part of the state near the Arizona and California borders has the highest concentration of Hiics in Nevada. An estimated one in four people speak Spanish at home in Clark county, where Las Vegas is situated. Many of those who have gravitated towards Las Vegas were attracted by work opportunities. Though Nevada was hit badly by the 2008-2010 financial crash, its concentration of hotels and casinos have long been a source of employment for workers, many originally from Mexico and central America.This week the city’s famous strip of hotels and casinos threw themselves into the political domain as some of Las Vegas’s best-known hotels created caucus sites for voters.Beginning last Saturday, the ground floor of venues such as the Bellagio and Wynn casino hotels opened up for early voting for local employees, some sites opening for 24 hours.The early-voting initiative was the result of lobbying by the local branch of the culinary workers’ union, a hugely influential force in local and state politics in Nevada. The union represents 60,000 workers on the strip including casino stewards, chefs and hospitality staff.It had long argued that the caucus system – which involves voters caucusing in local precincts at noon on a Saturday – disenfranchised thousands of casino workers and hospitality staff who typically work weekends. This year, early voting allowed many more workers to participate in the caucus system – opening up a potential new cohort of voters.This new variable was not lost on candidates, who have been busy courting the union chief and their members this week, though Bernie Sanders in particular has run into difficulty after the union warned that his “Medicare for all” plan could jeopardise the health insurance schemes of union workers.Originally from Ethiopia, Zewedi is a casino worker at the Bellagio, an upmarket 4,000-room hotel on the Las Vegas strip. She moved to the city 15 years ago from Africa as a refugee and decided to stay in the area. “The work is good,” she says, smiling, as she tidies the communal area surrounding the slot machines. Like most of her co-workers she is a union member.“It is fantastic. They ensure we have good work and conditions. No one has to work more than eight hours,” she says. She cast her vote in the Democratic caucus last Sunday in the hotel – the first time she has participated in the primary voting contest.Precinct captainsThe high proportion of early voters is a marked characteristic of the Nevada caucuses. Almost 75,000 ballots have already been cast this week. Nonetheless, all eyes will be on the state this weekend, particularly in light of the chaotic caucus process in Iowa on February 3rd. Nevada has already shelved plans to use a discredited app that was deployed in the ill-fated Iowa caucuses. Instead, so-called precinct captains will be given iPads with special online application spreadsheets.There is still room for problems, however. The early votes will need to be hand-fed into voting machines. Precinct captains will also be required to use a paper back-up worksheet. With all eyes on the integrity of the Democratic primary system on Saturday, Nevada will be hoping that it can avoid a repeat of the Iowa experience earlier this month.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Consumers at risk of being ripped off in \u0026#39wild west\u0026#39 carbon offsets marketCarbon offsetting may be a gold mine in the West – but in Madagascar, sapphires are the real prize Comment: Why offsetting is fooling people into thinking they\u0026#39re contributing to a greener futurePolice chief demands offenders who assault officers should face minimum jail sentences to deter further attacksInternal Whitehall shakeup discussions could see Ministry of Justice scrappedExtremist online forums that radicalise the young could be banned, says terror law watchdogTop civil servants call for complaints system to combat \u0026#39bullying\u0026#39 ministers after Priti Patel rowComment: The ban on coal and wood drives away the very people who trusted the ToriesMartin Bashir: I confronted \u0026#39dictatorial\u0026#39 vicar Jonathan Fletcher over exploitation of elderly parishioner - and he turned on meTory MPs warn government not to force through Huawei law \u0026#39on the sly\u0026#39 amid security concernsComment: I confronted \u0026#39dictatorial\u0026#39 Rev Jonathan Fletcher over exploitation  - and he turned on meEastEnders, 35th anniversary review: This soggy saga frequently felt like Titanic crossed with CasualtyVicar who beat naked men is still holding religious ceremoniesCoronavirus latest news: Chance to contain outbreak is \u0026#39narrowing\u0026#39 says WHOWhy Elizabeth Warren brought doughnuts to a union protest in VegasMI6 drops age requirement to recruit tech-savvy teenagers to give it a technological edgeFossil hunters find \u0026#39ice bird\u0026#39 from 46,000 years ago that looks like it died \u0026#39yesterday\u0026#39Violent social media posts must be used by prosecutors to crackdown on gangs, says DPPLesotho prime minister leaves country before he was due in court on murder chargesJury in Harvey Weinstein\u0026#39s trial ask if they can deliver a partial verdictUK archaeologists join forces with US government to oppose plans to salvage TitanicWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"carbon offsetting may gold mine west madagascar sapphires","story":"Sitting among the trenches of an illegal mine in eastern Madagascar, Edmond Rakoto says he has never heard of carbon offsetting.He knows about conservation, he says, gesturing towards the rainforest, but he has only one focus – to find a sapphire that could change his life and feed his family.Many of the thousands who live in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor, an area of ecological importance known as the CAZ, do not realise that the trees they cut down to clear space for mining and agriculture, or to build their homes and fuel their stoves, have already been turned into carbon credits.Carbon offsetting is a system under which businesses or iniduals can buy credits to compensate for carbon emissions. Credits are generated when a project is said to have reduced carbon by planting or protecting forests or investing in solar power. However, critics argue that there is no way to say that such projects would not have happened anyway and it is difficult to judge how well remote projects are working. In 2016, a study found that three quarters of carbon credits provided no environmental gain because the projects in question would have happened in any case.The  is one of the first media organisations ever to have gained access to illegal mining sites in eastern Madagascar and found that, despite carbon credits being sold on the basis that forest is being protected, there has been an increase in deforestation in recent years.The forest conservation zone is now set to be included in a second carbon credit sale, which is expected to bring $70 million to the region.Environmentalists say the issues found in Madagascar are echoed around the world, warning that the booming carbon offsetting industry could be doing more harm than good by greenwashing the real issues.In the CAZ – home to around 2,000 species of plant, of which 1,700 are endemic – the tensions between the need to protect the forest and the need of some of the world\u0027s poorest people to survive are clear.The area\u0027s sapphire rush began in earnest in 2016, and in Antsevabe, the village that acts as a gateway to the illegal mine, locals tell me that the people who have tin roofs on their homes are the ones who have found precious stones. Those with straw roofs are still farming.This is the border of the conservation zone, a beaten-up sign tells visitors who have taken a two-hour motorbike ride along a semi-dry river bed to reach it.Because of the conservation project, a forestry official is posted in the village. And because of security threats to the mine, so is a soldier, who sits nonchalantly, an AK47 on his lap, outside the hut that doubles as the village cafe and store.Neither seems concerned about either the impact of mining or the stream of villagers who emerge from the protected forest with logs balanced on their heads. There are lots of mines in the forest, the forestry official says. There are a number of gold mines, and the sapphire mine has about 1,000 people working there.One person tells me that he found a small sapphire and built a house with the 20,000,000 Ariary (£4,100) he made from it. He rents out the house to those passing through to get to the mine, which is sometimes visited by Sri Lankan and Thai traders. It was a wise investment, he boasts. On the other hand, villagers are more dismissive about what the conservation project has done. Some say they were given seeds for plants, bananas and coffee. Some were paid to plant trees. Others say they are still farming and have nothing to do with the project.These views are echoed by a study which found that the project was not reaching the most remote communities. The study said a total of $13-15 million was needed for compensation to them, but only $425,000 was being spent.Julia Jones, who conducted the study, says researchers are trying to point out a broader problem with carbon offsetting. The world needs to recognise the genuine cost. If you want to achieve a reduction in carbon emission by deforestation, it can\u0027t be done on the cheap,” she adds. The money has to get to the ones who are holding the axes – they are the ones who choose whether a tree gets chopped down or not.Conservation International, which runs the forest project on behalf of the Madagascan government, says it is now getting more money in but admits that slash and burn agriculture remains a major driver of deforestation.Environmentalists argue that the remoteness of the communities being used to generate carbon credits is, in part, the problem. How do you ensure that trees are not chopped down deep in a forest thousands of miles away?Those who run such projects from London or Washington are unlikely to ever trek 26 miles through a rainforest, over mountains and across more than 30 rivers to reach Tananarive, the Sapphire mine that sits deep in the CAZ.But for locals, it is a normal journey. We pass Julien, in his late 50s, who is coming back to get supplies. Most miners have sponsors, often Thai or Sri Lankan, but in some cases it is rumoured that government officials are involved. They provide miners with food, coffee and tools, and in return the miners sell the stones they find to them directly.Julien has lived at the mine for two years and will continue to go back, even though he has not found a single sapphire. Asked about conservation, he and his friends look nervously at the floor. There is no forest there any more, he tells me. But he adds enthusiastically: Where there is still forest, we will help to protect it.As you make your way deeper into the forest, accompanied by the calls of the Indri, one of the threatened species of lemur that lives there, the landscape is scarred with gold mines. We reach Tananarive – a mess of trenches in which the water runs a muddy brown and tree stumps smoulder on the hillside from a fresh area of burning – late in the afternoon.A community has sprung up, complete with a makeshift market and a church. People from all over Madagascar flooded into the area after that first sapphire discovery in 2016. Mr Rakoto left his life as a farmer. Others are miners by trade, while some are students trying to find a way to pay back their debts.Asma, in her late 40s, moved from the south with her husband and three sons and has called the mine home for four years. She has no plans to leave, especially after a 26-gramme sapphire was found at the end of December.There is no conservation here at the mine, she tells me in near perfect English. I don\u0027t know about a project, but some of the people are bad. They chop down and burn the trees so that they can grow crops and build houses. And there are the lemurs right at the edge of the trees.But environmentalists are quick not to make villains of the miners, who are trying to make a living in tough conditions. Barry Ferguson, a researcher and activist who has worked in Madagascar for more than 20 years, says: The demonisation of artisanal mining is the worst thing that can happen to the people of Madagascar. They have resources and they need to use them.The economic viabilities of carbon offsetting are ridiculous. It is not £1.50 to offset the carbon for your flight – it is more like £150.The Madagascan government echoes those concerns, with a spokesman for President Andry Rajoelina telling The : The whole world should understand that, despite enormous efforts being made by the government, it is difficult to eradicate deforestation in countries like Madagascar if the population remains extremely vulnerable to climate risks.Developing and vulnerable countries need additional resources and adequate technologies to combat global warming and achieve sustainable development targets.The number of people living at the mine is less than it was at its peak, when an estimated 4,500 miners flooded in to try and find their fortune. But the population is steady, with new people arriving to take the place of those who move on. Mining is now the second biggest industry in the country after agriculture, employing an estimated two million people.By the time the sapphire rush began, the conservation project had been authorised to sell carbon credits on the voluntary market, where consumers can purchase offsets for their flights. Conservation International and Verra, which administers the verified carbon standard that authorises the credits for sale, point out that they were issued for the period between 2008 and 2012, before deforestation rates increased.They say they had already reduced those emissions and therefore the carbon credits still stand. Each project must put credits in a buffer from which they can be cancelled if, for example, a forest burns down. Anybody who purchased and retired those credits should continue to have confidence that their investment had a climate impact, a spokesman for Verra says.But this basis is one with which environmental campaigners have a particular problem, as it is estimated that a tree needs to stand for 100 years to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.Chris Lang, who founded REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Monitor, says the fundamental problem is that while the release of greenhouse gases on a flight definitely happens, there is absolutely no way of guaranteeing that a forest will remain standing.He has been tracking offsetting projects for the last 11 years and says that, alongside fundamental flaws in the system, there have been a number of projects for which there is no monitoring. People have returned to a project after five years to find that the forest has gone.After illegal sapphire mining in Madagascar began, Conservation International pleaded with the government to take action. But there are allegations that local officials receive payments from miners, and one woman tells me that, when the army was called in to act, all the soldiers did was throw out European traders.A spokesman for President Rajoelina, who took office last month, says illegal mining has happened since the 1990s and the government is taking action to prevent it as well as launching a reforestation programme to plant 60 million trees.He adds that officials are taking a zero tolerance approach to corruption in Madagascar, which is still recovering from a coup a decade ago. Political instability and corruption are said to have an impact on many offsetting projects around the world – another reason campaigners say they cannot be used as an excuse to continue releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.An analysis of the CAZ shows that tree loss has accelerated in recent years. In the decade before 2016, losses stood at around 58 acres a year. In 2016, that rose to 205 acres, spiking at 426 acres in 2017. Conservation International does not hide the fact that deforestation has increased, but says it has dropped from a peak of 4.2 per cent and stood at 1.59 per cent in 2018.McKenzie Intelligence Services, which analysed the area on behalf of The  using Nasa and European Space Agency satellites, was able to detect significant areas of rainforest that had been cleared. Its team, which analyses vast areas of agricultural land for the global insurance industry, found that a substantial amount of the deforestation began around rivers and spread outwards.Not only has this resulted in large areas of forest being cut down and cleared, but we also have seen discolouration of these waterways, displaying a pale golden colour which is assessed to be sediment, soil and other contaminants getting into the water as a result of the cleared forest along the river banks, a spokesperson explains.This activity is not the first mining discovery in the corridor – rich in natural resources including gold and rubies – and experts say it will not be the last.The area has now been rolled into the government\u0027s Atiala Atsinanana programme, which will produce more credits that will again go to the World Bank – this time into the Forest Carbon Partnership Foundation. It is unclear what will happen to the credits once they have been generated, but they could be sold to the airline industry to form part of its offsetting plan, which comes into effect this year.The World Bank says all its projects adhere to rigorous requirements and account for net reductions over an entire area after taking into account emission increases in parts of the project.  The government is studying whether there will be any duplication between the two carbon credit projects and insists there will be no unfair model.Agustin Silvani, the head of conservation finance at Conservation International, says: Without this kind of funding, the situation in the CAZ would be a lot worse. We are definitely having an impact.But one thing is clear. While carbon offsetting might be the latest gold rush in the West, the sapphires are the real prize for the people of Madagascar.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coal wet wood ban could cost households 469m","story":"The ban on coal and wet wood could cost households up to £469m over the next ten years, according to government estimates. The government has been warned that its commitments to policies to tackle climate change and pollution risk leaving people behind if they are not given help to adapt. Sales of domestic coal and untreated wood will be phased out by 2023 as part of the government’s commitment to improving air quality. Dry wood is estimated to be 60 per cent more expensive than wet wood per tonne, while alternatives to traditional coal are 38 per cent more expensive. Up to 166,000 homes not on the gas grid rely on solid fuels, including 49,000 who rely on coal as their primary source of heating, with thousands of those thought to be in fuel poverty. Households in rural areas are more likely to be off the gas grid and could face a “double whammy” because of poor energy efficiency in older, bigger homes, National Energy Action, which advocates for those in fuel poverty, said. The government believes households could save more than £105m overall if they buy less fuel in weight terms, because the alternatives are more energy efficient. But its impact assessment of the change says this may not happen, and estimates a cost of up £469.2m by 2030 if households continue to buy at the same rate. Meanwhile, households in certain areas including Warwickshire and Harrogate will still be left with higher bills even adjusting for energy efficiency. The government is thought likely to extend the ban on wood and coal as it seeks to tackle both air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.While smokeless fuels are much better for air quality, they produce more carbon dioxide than traditional coal. Wood and coal stoves contribute 38 per cent of the most dangerous form of fine particle air pollution in the UK, which has been linked to strokes, asthma and lung cancer. Defra calculates the benefits to health and the environment of the ban on wet wood and domestic coal to be worth £7,877.8m. But NEA warned that thousands of low-income homes could be left without heating if they were forced to abandon coal and untreated wood, because alternatives are not always readily available, particularly in remote rural areas. “We support the government’s broader effort to improve air quality,” said Peter Smith, NEA’s director of policy. “But we know that thousands of low-income households are reliant on those forms of fuel and they’ll need to be provided with alternative heating technologies so they can continue to heat their homes adequately.” It called on the government to include its manifesto commitment for £2.5 billion to help people replace improve insulation or replace their boilers or energy systems, in the upcoming Budget. Moving a house to the most common forms of low-carbon heating can cost between £1,000-8,000 in upfront costs. Citizens Advice has warned the government not to leave vulnerable people behind in its bid to reach net zero on carbon emissions. A 2019 report from think tank Policy Connect warned that the net zero transition risked creating up to 2.6m more fuel poor households across the country if it was not carefully implemented. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/20/TELEMMGLPICT000225373468_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFmZwAHfbzbyjsBBHX-5Jh1FxexswdJIn0JCwl6ikJB0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"europe uneasy migration wont say","story":"Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives to give a statement to the media at the Chancellery following the Hanau shootings. Europe is uneasy about migration but won’t say whyOn Thursday, a middle-aged German called Tobias Rathjen drove to two shisha bars in Hanau, near Frankfurt, and shot dead nine people, all from immigrant backgrounds. He then went home and shot himself and his mother.That evening, huge, multi-racial crowds gathered to hold vigils and Germany’s president declared: “We want to live together.”Meanwhile, political recriminations began flying. The Left blamed the nativist AfD party. Some on the Right argued that Rathjen was a mentally ill loner whose actions mean nothing.He was certainly a delusional inidual. His online activity includes posting a video claiming that the US is controlled by “invisible secret societies” who “kill little children”. Given that his manifesto called for the annihilation of Arab states and Israel and the repopulation of the earth by half a billion “racially pure” Germans, however, it seems a little disingenuous to suggest that extremist, nativist ideologies are completely irrelevant to this event. The German far-Right, we should recall, is by far the country’s biggest source of fatal terrorist activity, whether it is against Jews, Turks, Kurds or pro-migration politicians.The fact is that Rathjen’s act was dressed in ideology. Fellow adherents range from Norwegian mass-murder Anders Breivik to Brenton Tarrant, the Australian who killed 49 in a rampage at a New Zealand mosque. Like Isil’s apocalyptic creed, this doctrine relies on a theory of epic conflict, in which its murderous acolytes are the brave foot soldiers. The core is an idea called “The Great Replacement”, which argues that the white, European peoples of the world are being systematically “replaced” by an “invasion” of brown and black peoples, amounting to an all-out assault on European religion, culture and racial identity.The custom, at this point, is to shut down the discussion by declaring that such ideas have no place in modern society and must be ruthlessly stamped out. And where they lead to terrifying, murderous rampages, as in Hanau, that is clearly right. But perhaps it would be more productive to say something true and uncomfortable as well. My hunch is that most people worried about racial change are not violent maniacs. Most of them are ordinary Europeans. In fact, I am willing to bet that if we probed the depths of Europe’s soul, we would find that this is a widely shared, largely unspoken anxiety harboured by millions of people.There is a code for talking about this subject. For understandable reasons, it is taboo to express doubts about racial ersity, a taboo broken by Andrew Sabisky, the Downing Street aide who quit this week. But the taboo does not eliminate people’s doubts. When people fret about Islam, for example, many of them are not thinking just about culture or religion, but race.The problem with the domineering, “liberal” response to this issue is that it involves ignoring some quite large facts. The biggest is that Europe is undergoing a profound shift in population. In the last 30 years, western European countries have seen enormous growth in the proportion of their population that was born abroad. In the UK it went from 6 per cent in the mid-1990s to 14 per cent in 2018. In Spain, it has grown from 3 per cent to 14 per cent, in Germany from 11 per cent to 16 per cent and in France from 7 per cent in the late-1990s (earliest comparable OECD data) to 12 per cent.These figures underplay people’s experience of change, because once here, migrants’ children are obviously counted as natives, when some people may not see it that way. Yes, there has always been migration, but by historic standards, this is a lightning-fast shift. At present, we are barely allowed to admit this is happening, let alone address the fact that people are anxious about it. In this vacuum, ideas like the “great replacement” flourish, providing ample fodder for the paranoid, violent and hateful.What is happening is, in fact, not a great replacement. It is a “great mingling”. White Europeans are not being effectively driven from their lands by a ruthless “white genocide”, as argued on certain niche forums. We are living alongside other races and religions, mixing with and changing one another. The population of Europe in one or two hundred years will probably be a new mixture, perhaps called something like “modern west Eurasians” by geneticists.Given the enormous potential for ethnic strife, as Germany has seen, the situation calls for European societies first, to admit this is happening and, secondly, decide whether or how to do something about it. It seems obvious that it would be wise to slow down the change, using whatever levers we have, which is one reason why the debate over immigration cannot simply be a question of whether care homes have enough workers. But the mingling is, at this point, inevitable. The question is how we manage it.One urgent task is for Europeans to address the weakness, perhaps even sickness, in our own culture. The ever-mutating barrage of self-hating, anti-patriotic fury and its flipside, the self-pitying, angry, white nationalist “involuntary celibate” types, of which Rathjen was one, are both disastrous.But more moderate advocates of British cultural identity are also to blame. If students raise the issue of colonisation, for example, our response should be to debate our history using facts, rather than wagging fingers or mouthing timid praise of the British Empire. Foreign cultural influence can and should help us to revive our own history and see it through a new lens. The most patriotic gathering I have ever attended was a dinner to celebrate the granting of British citizenship to a friend from the other side of the world. It would have given  readers a heart attack.We also need to know where to draw the line. Reasonable people should be able to listen calmly to those who say change is too fast, undesirable and is tearing our social and political fabric. They should be able to debate political tensions between Islam and Christianity.What cannot fly is the idea that people who live here as legal citizens, who were born on this continent, “do not belong here”, because of their religion, race or any other reason. To make such a claim about Islam, an infinitely erse religion of 1.8 billion people, as Germany’s AfD does, is a dead end. The only logical conclusion to draw from such a statement is that its practitioners must either leave, convert or be annihilated. That is the conclusion drawn by people like Breivik, Tarrant and, now, Rathjen, with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, it will not be the last time.Alternative for Germany (AfD)The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

An accompanying website offered drivers concerned about their environmental impact an exhaust emissions calculator and allowed them to pay to offset it by funding sustainable projects (just £20 for a year of driving, plus a free sticker for the car). The multinational had recently rebranded as Beyond Petroleum and was keen to burnish its green credentials as concerns about the environmental impact of oil began to prick the public\u0027s conscience.  Offsetting has boomed in the years since then, providing a convenient way for corporations to allay consumers\u0027 concerns about their environmental impact while continuing to grow. The past year has seen companies fall over themselves to make offsetting promises as environmental fears, helped by images of wildfires in Australia, floods in the UK and global school strikes, reached new heights. The idea is simple – what CO2 you emit in your flight, car journey or energy use can be got back by the world somewhere else, either in projects that suck up carbon or by funding alternatives to burning fossil fuels. But it has never really worked. Studies of major offsetting schemes have shown that many of the projects, particularly those focused on supplying renewable energy, would have happened anyway, meaning they haven\u0027t stopped any extra carbon dioxide emissions. Others are almost impossible to enforce – you can provide a family in Sudan with a fuel-efficient gas stove, for example, but you can\u0027t check that they are using it. Forestry projects, as The  found in Madagascar, are particularly difficult to track. Getting the carbon-capturing benefit of a tree isn\u0027t as simple as planting it and walking away. You have to ensure that it will be protected for decades – something that, especially in remote locations, is almost impossible to do. But none of this has stopped the growth of offsetting. Speak to advocates of the industry and they will tell you two things: offsetting is a temporary measure until technology to reduce emissions comes along, and these schemes are better than nothing even if they sometimes don\u0027t deliver what is advertised. But that\u0027s not the way offsetting is sold to consumers, who are led to believe that it can wipe their slate clean, no matter how much they emit. Airlines are particularly keen on the schemes because they have no real options to reduce emissions other than selling fewer flights. Electric planes are still a distant dream, while the availability of cheap flights and offsets reduces any consumer-driven incentive to invest in greener fuel alternatives. So this year they will bring in an offsetting scheme, known as Corsia, that will allow them to offset any extra emissions and continue selling ever more flights. Offsets provide a convenient way for corporations to convince us that the way we live now won\u0027t have to change if we have hope of limiting the impact of climate change. But consumers risk being fooled into thinking they are contributing to a greener future. Consumers at risk of being ripped off in \u0026#39wild west\u0026#39 carbon offsets marketCarbon offsetting may be a gold mine in the West – but in Madagascar, sapphires are the real prize Police chief demands offenders who assault officers should face minimum jail sentences to deter further attacksInternal Whitehall shakeup discussions could see Ministry of Justice scrappedExtremist online forums that radicalise the young could be banned, says terror law watchdogTop civil servants call for complaints system to combat \u0026#39bullying\u0026#39 ministers after Priti Patel rowComment: The ban on coal and wood drives away the very people who trusted the ToriesMartin Bashir: I confronted \u0026#39dictatorial\u0026#39 vicar Jonathan Fletcher over exploitation of elderly parishioner - and he turned on meTory MPs warn government not to force through Huawei law \u0026#39on the sly\u0026#39 amid security concernsComment: I confronted \u0026#39dictatorial\u0026#39 Rev Jonathan Fletcher over exploitation  - and he turned on meEastEnders, 35th anniversary review: This soggy saga frequently felt like Titanic crossed with CasualtyVicar who beat naked men is still holding religious ceremoniesCoronavirus latest news: Chance to contain outbreak is \u0026#39narrowing\u0026#39 says WHOWhy Elizabeth Warren brought doughnuts to a union protest in VegasMI6 drops age requirement to recruit tech-savvy teenagers to give it a technological edgeFossil hunters find \u0026#39ice bird\u0026#39 from 46,000 years ago that looks like it died \u0026#39yesterday\u0026#39Violent social media posts must be used by prosecutors to crackdown on gangs, says DPPLesotho prime minister leaves country before he was due in court on murder chargesJury in Harvey Weinstein\u0026#39s trial ask if they can deliver a partial verdictUK archaeologists join forces with US government to oppose plans to salvage TitanicComment: Racist narratives flourish when liberals refuse to acknowledge anxiety about population changeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/16/avengers-cover.jpg","title":"avengers 5 new character marvel mcu she hulk kevin feiege disney","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The report\u0026nbspchimes with previous hints dropped by MCU\u0026nbspboss Kevin FeigeA rumoured\u0026nbspcasting call made by Marvel has dropped a big hint that a major\u0026nbspnew character will be joining the next\u0026nbspAvengers\u0026nbspfilm.The company has always remained tight-lipped about many future plans for the\u0026nbspMarvel Cinemaic Universe (MCU), with details occasionally leaking out through gossip websites and leaks.Almost nothing is known for certain about the future of the\u0026nbspAvengers\u0026nbspmovies, the ambitious crossover series\u0026nbspthat will bring together characters from across the MCU.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever,\u0026nbsptheilluminerdi has leaked an apparent\u0026nbspcasting call for the upcoming Disney+ streaming series\u0026nbspShe-Hulk.She-Hulk\u0026nbspis one of several Marvel properties that is being adapted into a series, along with\u0026nbspWandaVision,\u0026nbspThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\u0026nbspLoki,\u0026nbspMarvel‘s What If...?,\u0026nbspHawkeye,\u0026nbspMs. Marvel\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMoon Knight.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage.

What’s more, the casting call supposedly gives details about the character of Jennifer Walters, Bruce Banner’s cousin who becomes the hero She-Hulk.\u0026nbspSpecifically, it states that Walters will be a “future member of the Avengers” – which would make her the first character to transition from TV to cinema in the MCU.\u0026nbspThe rumour chimes\u0026nbspwith previous comments made by Marvel boss Kevin Feige, in which he confirmed She-Hulk would appear in MCU films, although he refused to say whether this meant as an Avenger or otherwise.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The current budget in the fiscal year so far was in deficit by £7.2bn.Under the fiscal rules set by former chancellor Sajid Javid, who resigned earlier this month, the government must balance the current budget over three years, although borrowing for infrastructure is allowed up 3 per cent of GDP, which would allow an extra £22bn of public sector net investment a year.“While the current fiscal rule, would still allow a large rise in public investment, the rise in the deficit makes the ambition of balancing the current budget deficit more restrictive,” said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at analysts Capital Economics.Mr Sunak said this week he would stick with the 11 March date for the government’s first post-Brexit Budget, ending speculation that the plans, which are likely to entail a big increase in spending, would be delayed.Philip Shaw, the chief UK economist at Investec, said the critical factor for next month’s Budget would be how much fiscal headroom there was to raise spending further beyond the plan for 2020-21 that Mr Javid set out last September.“The Conservatives’ manifesto committed the party to balancing the current budget during this parliament,” he\u0026nbspsaid.Mr Shaw added\u0026nbspthat how much room Mr Sunak had depended on precisely how this was defined, for example, which specific year in the parliament was used.“Our guess is that although there will not be much space for fiscal generosity, the chancellor will find some,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The suspension effectively isolates us from social aspects of student life, as well as meaning we are not allowed to submit our work.\u0026nbsp“This is something that is distressing to many members of the occupation who may now have to repeat a year or even drop out.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe 18-year-old added: “We are living with the uncertainty that management and the student discipline will decide to evict us. This will effectively make us homeless, some students who are facing this come from Bath, Ireland and Germany so it would leave them in a horrible position.”However, their suspension has not stopped their support of university staff striking. Many of the group stood in solidarity with workers at Strathclyde University and Glasgow University of Art on Friday.\u0026nbspA petition “condemning” the punishment by Stirling University has been signed by nearly 2,500 people.Winchester University has also come under fire for a statement on their intranet site earlier this week which said: “Based on current information, including the fact that Winchester Student Union supports the strike action, the university is not considering any form of reduction in fees or compensation.”Megan Ball, president of Winchester Students’ Union, said she was “appalled and disgusted” at the message. “Our support of these strikes has absolutely no bearing on their ability to reimburse,” she said.\u0026nbspFollowing criticism online, the university has removed the statement from their “frequently asked questions” on the strike action. It is now keeping the question of compensation “under review”.Students may face ‘larger class sizes’ if staff get strike demandsJo Grady, general secretary of the UCU, said: “People are rightly angry at this bizarre attempt from the university to force students to denounce the strike action. Winchester students, like their contemporaries across the UK, have been magnificent in showing their support for their striking staff.“Students have genuine concerns about the conditions their staff work under and for a university to try and weaponise those concerns is contemptible.“Universities need to understand that the way to get these disputes sorted out is by talking to us, not threatening their staff or students.”On the action taken by Stirling University, Ms Grady added:\u0026nbsp“Students are entitled to engage in peaceful demonstrations and should not be penalised for having opinions.\u0026nbsp“Rather than looking to take punitive action against their own students the university should be concentrating its efforts on trying to force a resolution to the disputes.”\u0026nbspA Stirling University spokesperson said they took action against the students after fire doors were locked during the occupation, which broke fire regulations.\u0026nbspThey said: “The university respects the rights of students to make their voices heard.\u0026nbspHowever, this must be done safely and in accordance with fire, and health and safety, legislation, as well as university regulation.“The safety and wellbeing of our university community is of paramount importance, and the fire risk posed has been a central consideration during the disciplinary process. While that process and any appeals continue, no students involved are required to vacate university accommodation.”University and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While its win was a coup for DreamWorks – the film was the studio\u0027s third victor in a row– it was far from a deserving recipient, especially considering Ron Howard won Best Director over Robert Altman and David Lynch for Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive, respectively.219 Chariots of Fire (1981)While Chariots of Fire is precisely the type of film the Academy usually takes under its wing, the fact it won was a big surprise, considering everybody present had expected Reds to win the top prize. The Warren Beatty film would have been a far worthier winner, too.Cold Mountain lucked out by being nominated in what was a particularly weak year for Best Supporting Actress. Renée Zellweger recovered from failing to win for Chicago the previous year and, in doing so, earnt the unremarkable drama its Oscar-winning tag.Viewers of the Oscars have grown used to unexpected victories, but none was more ill-judged than when Paul Haggis\u0027 drama Crash beat Brokeback Mountain to Best Picture.519 Dances with Wolves (1990)It\u0027s quite soul-destroying to think that Dances with Wolves scooped a total of seven Oscars in the same year that Goodfellas was nominated.Alicia Vikander\u0027s performance in The Danish Girl is by no means weak, but it was nothing on Rooney Mara\u0027s affecting turn in Todd Haynes\u0027 film Carol. Had Tom Hooper not won five years before for The King\u0027s Speech, it seems unlikely that the drama would have picked up any nominations.Put simply, The English Patient isn\u0027t a very good film. Of the nine (nine!) Oscars it won, Juliette Binoche\u0027s trophy for Best Supporting Actress was perhaps the most surprising. The French star herself could barely contain her shock. This will most likely be this list\u0027s most controversial placement, but let\u0027s be honest: Gladiator is not the fantastic film it\u0027s regularly hailed as. Ridley Scott\u0027s overlong historical drama boasts plenty of swords-and-sandal bravado, but not much else.The musical Going My Way may have been the biggest cinematic hit of its year, but it certainly wasn\u0027t better that classic noir Double Indemnity, which it beat to win Best Picture. In fact, it\u0027s nowhere near director Leo McCarey\u0027s greatest film (he won six years previous for the Awful Truth and would be nominated again for The Bells of St Mary\u0027s two years later).There\u0027s a reason why Grand Hotel is the only film to ever win Best Picture without receiving a nomination in any other category. An entertaining film, sure, but nothing more.1119 The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)It\u0027s ironic that a film with the word greatest in its title has gone down as one of the worst winners in Oscars history. A prime example of when the Academy voted for spectacle over quality.To those who don\u0027t care about awards ceremonies, Green Book is a crowdpleaser that boasts decent performances from Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. To everyone else, it\u0027s the damp squib that somehow came out of nowhere to snatch Best Picture from under Roma\u0027s nose. The Imitation Game won Best Adapted Screenplay, which begs the question: what the hell was this distinctly average film doing having any nominations at all?Meryl Streep has won enough Oscars for the world to know she\u0027s evidently one of the finest actors who\u0027ll ever live. Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years.

But attempts to discover it turned up nothing, until the latest discovery.Now researchers say they have found signs of oxygen in a galaxy called\u0026nbspMarkarian 231, 560 million lightyears away. That galaxy lies in the constellation Ursa Major and was already notable because it contains a bright quasar, where gas is swirled around a black hole\u0026nbspand glows visibly through the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs well as being the site of the first ever detection of breathable oxygen outside of our galaxy, Markarian 231 contains the most oxygen ever seen outside of our own solar system.Astronomers from China\u0027s Shanghai Astronomical Observatory were able to spot signs of oxygen using radio telescopes on Earth.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

That is the signal for O2 in its breathable form, leading researchers to that they had made the\u0026nbspfirst detection of extragalactic molecular oxygen, as they write in the paper published in the Astrophysical Journal.Nasa could find alien planets that host life after new breakthroughOxygen is so hard to see from Earth because many of the signals that would alert us to it are absorbed by Earth\u0027s atmosphere. The new discovery was possible in part because the light is redshifted as it travels through space, allowing it to be stretched out into a wavelength that could more easily get through the atmosphere.While the gas is present in\u0026nbspMarkarian 231 in the form that humans breathe, actually travelling there and breathing it would not be possible. The swirl of gases present in the atmosphere does not have the same makeup as it does on Earth, and those other gases are required to allow humans to breathe in oxygen.But the discovery offers an important way of tracking how O2 interacts with such extreme astrophysical areas, the scientists write, and further examination of the galaxy could allow us to learn about how oxygen is present through the rest of the cosmos.And it also suggests that we may be able to find more oxygen, elsewhere in the universe. New equipment could be used to find oxygen elsewhere in the universe, the scientists involved write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the power’s there. We\u0027ve moved the engine but we haven\u0027t moved the user interface framework. We’ve made sure to lift the metaphors that we really want to keep alive on the iPad.”The initial release of Photoshop for iPad was met with mixed reviews, to which Adobe responded with a blog post insisting that the company was listening and detailing some of the changes that were on the way.Photoshop mistake shows Australian PM with two left feetTo celebrate the thirtieth birthday, Adobe has just announced new features for the desktop version, such as improvements to lens blur effects, performance improvements to discover a “more buttery and seamless mouse experience.”For the iPad version, the new elements include type settings, which addresses earlier worries users had, and an object selection tool which was only released for the desktop version a few months ago. In other words, the iPad version is adding desktop features, and fast.\u0026nbspBack to Lamkin: what does he mean when he refers to metaphors?“Well, take something as fundamental to Photoshop as masking, he says.\u0026nbspTo mask a layer on the desktop product is something that you can approach in three or four different ways. Do we want to offer three or four different approaches on the iPad? I don\u0027t think so.The metaphor of layer masks is something that\u0027s really critical to compositing. How do we reveal that in a way that is appropriate for that device and appropriate for new classes of customers?”One way of keeping things simple for newcomers is the way Adobe progressively reveals functionality. “Sure, as opposed to having 12 different options show up in the menu bar, we express things in a way that\u0027s more appropriate for the device and the users who are going to come to that for the first time on the iPad.”Is that Photoshop newbie the customer who is Adobe’s main priority with iPad? Adobe has made a big focus on accessibility and on different programs working together, so is accessibility or integration more important?Lamkn pauses and says:\u0026nbsp“I\u0027d say our top two priorities are building a great multi-surface workflow for Photoshop customers and paying close attention to established Photoshop customers who want to add a touch device to their workflow, to be able to work anywhere, regardless of what device they\u0027re working on. But we also want to acquire new customers who are really primary to that device. We don’t want to make any horrendous trade-offs in our iPad implementation of the product.”It’s a journey, then, which is also a useful response to some of those initial reviews. “We\u0027ve chosen to really focus on enabling the key workflows and use cases that are the most compelling out of the gates and to add additional use cases as we go, as opposed to trying to boil the ocean and deliver everything all at once until we understand how people actually use it.”With something like Photoshop that’s been going for so long, creating that blank canvas must be quite a daunting part of the design with the new iPad version.Lamkin nods. “Oh, it’s a heavy lift. We\u0027ve been at we\u0027ve been at it for three-and-a-half years. A lot of experimentation with how much risk do we take in delivering a new experience at the risk of not fully satisfying the existing customer base. It\u0027s not something we took lightly and it\u0027s something that the team worked for a couple years to get to.”Finally,\u0026nbspLamkin talks about\u0026nbspthe person coming to Photoshop for the first time on the iPad. What would he want the first big takeaway from trying Photoshop on the iPad to be?“Approachability and delight,” he says. “It\u0027s like I open this up and within 10 minutes I’ve familiarized myself with the application and the language and how I need to approach it to get the most out of it and I\u0027m delighted by what I can do just out of the gate.I want users to after 10-15 minutes session have done something that they\u0027re proud of. I’m not saying that they\u0027re going to learn the whole application, but they’ll say, hey, I understand how layers work and I\u0027ve been able to do a composite and, boom, I got something magical I just created.Creativity should be light, there should be a lightheartedness in this application too. There should be a sense of discovery as you\u0027re exploring, and the tools need to facilitate that by getting out of the way.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

It will perhaps become more generally settled by the middle of March, with more prolonged dry spells possible, especially in the south.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Over 1,000 cases and 11 deaths have been confirmed outside the mainland.Here\u0027s how we covered development as they happened:Spike in coronavirus cases in Chinese prisons prompt sackings of officialsThree new cases of local transmission confirmed in ItalyNew coronavirus cases, deaths, confirmed in IranIsraeli returning from Diamond Princess becomes first coronavirus case in IsraelHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live blog.China sacks officials after rise in coronavirus cases in prisons234 people in two prisons outside the Hubei province have been infected with coronavirus, prompting the sacking of several top officials.Chinese authorities fired the chief of the provincial justice department in the northern province of Shandong after infections were found in a prison there and in the eastern province of Zhejiang.Seven other prison officials were also fired, authorities told a media briefing. Yu Chenghe, deputy secretary-general of the Shandong provincial government, said the outbreak showed some departments had poorly implemented their responsibilities, their work was not solid and epidemic prevention measures are inaccurate.The director and Communist Party chief of the Shilifeng prison in Zhejiang was also sacked and an investigation has been launched.The prison cases made up more of the 258 newly confirmed cases in China on Thursday, ending the 16-day streak of declines reported by Chinese authorities excluding cases in Hubei.In Hubei, where the virus is most widespread, a total of 271 cases in two jails were confirmed, including 230 in a women\u0027s prison in Wuhan.The governor of the women\u0027s prison had been dismissed for failing to control the spread of the virus, reported the Hubei Daily newspaper.Additional reporting by agenciesKyrgyzstan suspends visas for Chinese nationalsKyrgyzstan has temporarily halted the issuance of new visas to Chinese nationals to avoid the virus spreading from the neighbouring country, deputy foreign minister Nurlan Abdrakhmanov was quoted saying on Friday.According to Kyrgyz news agency Akipress, Abdrakhmanov said Chinese nationals who already have Kyrgyz visas are still allowed to enter the country.The Central Asian country shares borders with China, Tajikstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.Three more Italian nationals test positiveThree Italian nationals have tested positive for coronavirus in the Lombardy region, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Italy up to six.The first case was confirmed on Friday, with the infected patient testing positive after meeting with a friend who recently returned from China, said local authorities.Shortly after, Giulio Gallera, a member of local government, said in a statement the wife and a close friend of the initial patient had the virus and were now in quarantine.Around 100 people are being tested for the virus in the city of Codogno, where the initial patient is from.Reporting by ReutersAn Israeli woman who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has tested positive for coronavirus upon her return, reports Israeli media.According to The Jerusalem Post, the women had tested negative for the virus while in Japan but a test done by the Ministry of Health in Israel came back positive.11 of 15 Israeli travelers who were on the ship will remain in quarantine for a further two weeks. They departed from Japan on Thursday via a chartered flight and arrived at the Ben-Gurion Airport on Friday.The other four Israeli cruise ship passengers were transferred to hospitals in Japan for treatment.Israel\u0027s Health Ministry confirmed the case and said in a statement: In the course of testing conducted by the Health Ministry\u0027s central laboratory, one of the passengers who returned from the ship in Japan was found to be positive.The laboratory is pursuing confirmation of the finding. The remaining returning passengers tested negative today. The patient is in quarantine and under supervision and this is not an infection that took place in\u0026nbspIsrael.Coronavirus may be present \u0027in all cities in Iran\u0027, say officialsAn official from Iran\u0027s health ministry has said coronavirus has spread to several cities in the country, according to the official IRNA news agency.Health ministry official Minou Mohrez said: Based on existing reports, the spread of coronavirus started in Qom and with attention to people\u0027s travels has now reached several cities in the country including Tehran, Babol, Arak, Isfahan, Rasht and other cities, and it\u0027s possible that it exists in all cities in Iran.Iran confirmed 13 new coronavirus cases and two deaths on Friday.Reporting by ReutersAirlines to lose billions in revenue due to outbreakAir travel will fall for the first time in over a decade as a result of coronavirus, said the International Air Transport Association (IATA).In the association\u0027s assessment of the impact of the virus, it found a potential 13 percent full-year loss of passenger demand, specifically for airlines in Asia Pacific.It will\u0026nbsptranslate into a US$27.8 billion revenue loss in 2020 for Asia Pacific carriers, most of which are registered in China. US$12.8 billion is predicated to be lost in China\u0027s domestic market alone.But the impact will be felt by the global air travel market, said IATA\u0027s CEO Alexandre de Juniac.He said: These are challenging times for the global air transport industry. Stopping the spread of the virus is the top priority. Airlines are following the guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health authorities to keep passengers safe, the world connected, and the virus contained.The sharp downturn in demand as a result of COVID-19 will have a financial impact on airlines—severe for those particularly exposed to the China market. We estimate that global traffic will be reduced by 4.7 percent\u0026nbspby the virus, which could more than offset the growth we previously forecast and cause the first overall decline in demand since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09.And that scenario would translate into lost passenger revenues of US$29.3 billion. Airlines are making difficult decisions to cut capacity and in some cases routes. Lower fuel costs will help offset some of the lost revenue. This will be a very tough year for airlines, he added.Our report:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBREAKING: 11 Americans evacuated from Diamond Princess cruise ship test positive for coronavirusAt least 11 Americans who returned to the US after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus.The evacuees were transported from the ship to American air force bases this week, where they remained under quarantine.\u0026nbspFive other evacuees had symptoms of the virus.The Center for Disease Control and Prevention have also said the US State Department evacuated Americans from the ship despite objections from health officials.The CDC argued to keep 14 infected people in Japan instead of sending them back to the US.More to follow:\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are changing our immigration policy to one that’s fit for purpose for our economy, based on skills.“This is not about refugees and asylum and people being persecuted around the world. We must differentiate between the two.”Ms Patel later told BBC Radio 5 Live that her parents had faced persecution in Uganda, pointing out that the changes she is introducing do not affect the way in which the UK will deal with people fleeing persecution overseas.“This is not about changing rules on asylum and refugees\u0026nbspand people that are being persecuted around the world – the two are fundamentally different so I think it is wrong to conflate the two,” said the home secretary. “My family were persecuted in East Africa so there is a complete difference between the two.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Home Office just doesn’t get it.”The criticism follows a fierce backlash against the crackdown, which was unveiled on\u0026nbspWednesday and will replace free movement with a minimum salary threshold of £25,600 for most workers.It was branded “a disaster” by social-care leaders, who fear a deepening recruitment crisis, while\u0026nbspbusiness leaders warned of problems for companies in lower-wage parts of the UK.Ms Patel was then ridiculed for claiming 8 million “economically inactive” Britons could plug the jobs gap,\u0026nbsponly for it to be pointed out that the vast majority are unpaid carers, the long-term sick, and students.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A message projected onto the White Cliffs of DoverBig Ben, shows the hands at eleven o\u0027clock at nightNigel Farage speaks to pro-Brexit supportersPro-Brexit demonstrators celebrate on Parliament Square The Union flag is taken down outside the European Parliament in BrusselsPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA pro-Brexit supporter jumps on an EU flag in Parliament SquareEU Council staff removed the Union Jack-British flag from the European Council in Brussels, BelgiumPedestrians pass in front of the Ministry of Defence Building on Whitehall, illuminated by red, white and blue lights in central London A Brexit supporter shouts during a rally in LondonPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghPro-EU campaigners take part in a \u0027Missing EU Already\u0027 rally outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA large pro-EU banner is projected onto Ramsgate cliff in KentPro-EU supporters light candles in Smith Square in WestminsterA man waves Union flags from a small car as he drives past Brexit supporters gathering in Parliament SquareThe five-year old Elisa Saemann, left, and her seven-year old sister Katie hold a placard during a rally by anti-Brexit protesters outside the Scottish parliament in EdinburghPro Europe supporters gather on Brexit day near the British embassy in Berlin, GermanyAnti-Brexit protester hugs a man while holding a placard A decorated, old fashioned fire pump in Parliament SquarePro Brexit Elvis impersonator performs at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexiteers stands with his dog in Parliament SquarePaddy from Bournemouth wears Union colours as he sits next to an EU flag decorated bag in Parliament Square A pro-EU activist plays a guitar decorated with the EU flag during a protest organised by civil rights group New Europeans outside Europe House, central LondonPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA Pro Brexit supporter has a Union Jack painted onto his face at Parliament SquareMen hold placards celebrating Britain leaving the EUPro Brexit supporters dance in the street draped with Union Jack flags at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexit demonstrator spreads his wings during a gathering near Downing StreetPro EU supporters display a banner \u0027 Here to Stay, Here to Fight, Migrants In, Tories Out\u0027 from Westminster bridgePro-Brexit supporters burn European Union flags at Parliament SquareA man poses for a picture on Parliament Square in a \u0027Brexit Day\u0027 t-shirtPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA man wears a pro-Brexit t-shirtAnti-Brexit demonstrators visit Europe House to give flowers to the staff on Brexit dayPro Brexit supporter wears a novelty Union Jack top hat outside the Houses of ParliamentCustomers Scott Jones and Laura Jones at the Sawmill Bar in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, where a Brexit party is being held throughout the dayA Brexit supports holds a sign in Parliament SquareA man carries an EU themed wreathAnn Widdecombe reacts with other members of the Brexit party as they leave en masse from the European ParliamentAnti-Brexit demonstrators in Parliament SquarePro EU supporters let off flares from Westminster BridgeBritish MEPs Jonathan Bullock, holding the Union Jack flag and Jake Pugh leave the European Parliament, in Brussels on the Brexit dayNewspapers and other souvenirs at a store, near Parliament SquareBrexit supporters hold signs in Parliament SquarePro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald with a Border Communities Against Brexit poster before its unveiling in Carrickcarnon on the Irish borderNational growers organisation British Apples \u0026amp Pears has renamed a British apple to EOS, the Greek goddess of dawn, to commemorate Brexit dayPro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareBritain\u0027s departure from the European Union was set in law on January 29, amid emotional scenes, as the bloc\u0027s parliament voted to ratify the orce papers.

They’re the ones who have the deepest sense of who they are, and what they value, and what they care about.”Mr Buttigieg then paid tribute to his husband Chasten, who was sat in the\u0026nbspfront row of the audience.Buttigieg mocks Trump for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels“And one of those people by the way, one of the strongest people I know, is my husband, Brad Pitt.”During his interview with Ms DeGeneres, Mr Buttigieg also questioned\u0026nbspto what extent Mr Trump meets the traditional definition of masculinity: “You know, when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan, Donald Trump was working on season seven\u0026nbspof Celebrity Apprentice.”As the Democratic presidental primary continues, Mr Buttigieg is still riding high from his strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, but has yet to rise towards the top of the national polls, in which Bernie Sanders still leads the other candidates by a significant margin.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And more people now watch YouTube than all terrestrial broadcasters put together.Even the BBCs highest paid star, Gary Lineker, says its time to make the fee voluntary, while Dame Helen Mirren admits its had its day.Yet the Government’s policy has provoked howls of outrage, especially from the chattering liberals who seem to regard the licence fee as a sacred part of our constitution.Their squeals of protest are badly misplaced. The fact is that, by guaranteeing a huge revenue stream, the licence fee promotes a culture of excess and mismanagement within the BBC, which has a budget of almost £ billion and employs , people.Its reflected in the vast salaries paid to scores of BBC stars, far beyond market rates, like the £. million previously dished out to Lineker, £, to newsreader Huw Edwards, or the £, to sports presenter Jason Mohammad.You can spot it in the host of botched or extravagant schemes, like the notorious reconstruction of the EastEnders set, whose budget soared from £ million to £. million.Worse still, a staggering £ billion was spent on the refurbishment of Broadcasting House in central London.There is also absurd doubling up among staff, particularly in the news.Last week, the BBC had  correspondents covering the American Democrat primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, while in  no fewer than  on-air journalists were sent to report on one brief Brussels summit attended by David Cameron.But the lack of any commercial pressure is most easily spotted in the vast, sprawling tiers of flabby bureaucracy.Ab Fab comedian Jenner Saunders once said of the corporation, “It’s become top-heavy in such an ugly way,” adding that it is “an executive-run place for idiots”.A glance through the BBC’s Annual Report for  shows just how correct she was.On these pages, I counted no fewer than eight managers who had “Human Resources Director” in their job titles, all of them on at least £,-a-year.Among them were: Dale Haddon, “HR Director, News and Employee Relations”, on up to £, Rachel Currie, “BBC Group HR Director” on up to £, and Gillian Taylor, “HR Director” on £,.It was the same story with BBC News, whose regiment of well-healed officials included: Fran Unsworth, the “Director of News” on £, Gavin Allen, “Head of News Output” on £, and Jonathan Munroe, Head of Newsgathering” on £,.This grasping spirit prevails throughout the bloated organisation, from the £, “Director of Nations and Regions” to the £, “Director of Radio and Education.”Insulated by public funding, the corporation adores both navel-gazing and self-promotion. So it has a “Director of Communications” on £,-a-year, a “Director of Policy” on £, and a “Director of Editorial Policy” on £,.All that puts into perspective the current moans from the BBC about the need for cuts.But apart from the managerial excess, what also aggravates is how the corporation uses its publicly-funded muscle to promote a fashionable, London-centric agenda.As the state’s monopoly broadcaster, the BBC should be utterly impartial.Yet its output is dominated by trendy political messages on immigration, climate change, Tory cuts, ersity and poverty.The BBC might have lavished reporters on the Democrat primaries, but it gave hardly any live coverage to the recent celebrations in Parliament Square at the moment of Brexit.Typically a Newsnight discussion  that evening – held in a studio bedecked with the blue and gold of the EU - featured two Remainers and one Brexiteer.Left-wing propaganda is continually crowbarred into everything from drama to discussion programmes.Just  per cent of the national workforce is employed in the public sector, yet the BBC is filled with the voices of state employees, most of them whining about under-funding.Left-wing opinions have a stranglehold most topical comedy shows, such as Radio Four’s News Quiz, hosted by the achingly unfunny Nish Kumar.It was Kumar who recently caused a storm by sneeringly presenting an edition of the BBC children’s show “Horrible Histories”, in which Britain’s Victorian past was held up for ridicule.The BBC can get away with this because of its lucrative monopoly as the state’s only broadcaster. It has abused that privileged position for too long.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No one is suggesting you won’t have Strictly Come Dancing or Match of the Day or even Question Time and Newsnight.But the media is fundamentally changing. Consumer choice – what you or me choose to consume on the box or on our iPads or phones and at what time – is king.The idea that by  paying £. for a service that we may choose not to watch or listen to AT ALL is insanity.It might be unpleasant for BBC lers but the time has come to accept that the licence fee must evolve into a subscription service, so that the corporation is accountable to viewers and not the current behemoth that puts local newspapers out of business, that competes with national newspaper websites to write about Love Island, and that makes podcasts like Reality Tea all about the MTV reality series Geordie Shore.That is NOT public service broadcasting. It is a blatant and constant attempt to undercut struggling commercial rivals.But a sea change is coming. I truly feel it.Sure, there might be disagreement at Downing Street about exactly what that change will involve.Personally I’m on the side of Dominic Cummings who wants wholescale cuts. Sell Radio  and Radio , shut down the sweeping BBC Online department and focus on true public service programming that won’t be provided where. Then in  allow people the choice about whether they want to pay for what they watch from the BBC or not.But the plan by Boris Johnson - who The Times reports this morning fancies an evolution not a revolution - is also valid. The first step to decriminalise the licence fee is the start of bringing the BBC back in line.The fact we’re even having this discussion is the fault of the BBC, which has proven itself to be untrustworthy and lacking in political impartiality in recent years.It disgraced itself over its coverage of Brexit. It proved it was no longer in touch with vast swathes of the country the folk outside of London who don’t spend their days eating quinoa salads and quaffing champagne with other members of the liberal media elite.It proved itself out of touch for failing to predict the biggest story at the most recent election: Boris Johnson’s historic toppling of Labour’s northern red wall.But what’s most telling is the fact some of the BBC’s biggest proponents are now speaking out to insist the corporation must adapt to change. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: The Mega Agency Dame Helen Mirren is the latest celeb to e into the debate over the licence feeShe said this week: “I think the that the licence fee has had its day.”She joins the BBC’s highest paid presenter Gary Lineker who has said it should be abolished.In all honesty though so should his contract, which costs licence fee payers £. million a year for minimal work.Radio ’s Evan Davis last week said the BBC needs to axe radio stations and either BBC or BBC rather than keep trimming costs around the edges.The need for genuine change at the BBC has reached a tipping point.It has to happen now.

Will this plan do much to bring down the overall immigration numbers as the Tories have long promised EXTINCTION Rebellion “activists” who dug up a lawn at Cambridge University are nothing more than virtue-signalling thugs.If lads from a local estate were caught vandalising such hallowed grounds, they’d be roundly rebuked. But some — thankfully not the cops, who have made two arrests — want to make excuses for the children of middle-class dons.We sympathise with the general cause: recent floods are a timely reminder that action on climate change can’t wait.But how does destroying the hard work of grafting gardeners win over anyone to their side If Extinction Rebellion activists want to make themselves useful, they can head up North and help out with Storm Dennis relief efforts.If not, they should skedaddle before they embarrass themselves any further.NEW Conservative MP Ric Holden is bang on the money: the toilet tax takes the... proverbial. Because of a weird loophole in the law, public toilets are liable for business rates.That means councils which own public toilets have to stump up the considerable cost of running them — and a whacking great tax on top of that.Councillors don’t like their precious cash being sucked down the pan, so are falling over each other to shut them.And the results have been disastrous for those with medical issues that make public lavs a godsend.According to the Royal Society of Public Health, one in five people don’t leave their homes as often as they would like to because they can’t be confident of finding a loo when they need one.If Rishi Sunak is looking to prove he’s got his head screwed on, scrapping the toilet tax would be a good place to start.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are simply stunning.It’s no wonder that the Greeks want them to be ed to Athens while we want to keep them.They are on display for free in the British Museum, and I would urge you to pay them a visit.You cannot help but be moved by the amazing level of craftsmanship and imagination embodied in them.The outstanding sculptures depict, in expressive detail, rippling muscles, bulging veins, fluttering robes, the flaring nostrils of horses and the upward swing of a bull’s head in a flowing, dynamic composition that reveals the extraordinary skill of their creators.They have inspired artists in their depiction of the human and animal form since they were rediscovered in the th Century.To have them here in Britain, in the care of the British Museum since , is an enormous privilege, never to be taken for granted.We are lucky that Lord Elgin found them and made a deal with the local Ottoman rulers at the time to bring so many of them back to the UK in the early s.At the time, the Parthenon was no longer the awe-inspiring temple it had been.In fact, it had been badly damaged in an explosion in , and when Lord Elgin took them, many of the marbles were little more than rubble.Since being housed in the British Museum, among other stunning treasures from the ancient world, public understanding of their signicance has grown.They continue to inspire anyone who sees them with a sense of what human beings can achieve in the application of knowledge, imagination and skill.At the British Museum, which is legally obliged to care for them in perpetuity, they can be visited and studied by adults, children and young people from all over the country.Not all of us will be lucky enough to travel to Greece in our letime but your mind can wander there by seeing the Elgin Marbles in London.And it is important that our kids continue to do this, because it opens up the history of the world and art.It is not just Brits either. London is one of the most accessible cities in the world, easy to reach from across Europe and where.People from around the globe visit the museum and learn what we share in common, and how humans have interpreted the world through their artefacts.We should resist the claim that artefacts belong where they were made, not least because it denies historical truth.Throughout history, artefacts have been traded across the world, often to the benefit of the people who created them, sometimes to their detriment. History is complicated and often not to our liking.The Parthenon was built long before modern Greece existed — when the region was made up of warring cities ided by arid mountains.Those who built the Parthenon had no notion of nationhood. Their concern at the time would have been to show off their city.How proud they would have beenthey could have foreseen the reverence with which their creations are held today around the world.The fact that the DNA of their descendants is now likely to have spread worldwide only reinforces the point that the geographical origin of the Marbles carries little objective signicance.Giving in to repatriation demands will undo the real achievements of cultural history in showing that more unites us than ides us. The amazing thing about the flowering of knowledge about the world in the th and th Centuries was that it created an awareness of human potential — a sense of what we could achieve in the arts and sciences.The Marbles symbolise this achievement — they opened up horizons and revealed new possibilities for human thought and action.Maintaining this sense of openness remains as important now as ever.In today’s globalised world, it’s tempting to think that people can see anything via the internet,not physically.But we must fiercely guard our museum collections, which remain the most accessible way for properly engaging with history.The Government is right to refuse to include the Elgin Marbles in any deals with the EU.They should never be used as political capital to serve the interests of European elites.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is cheaper to buy, but contains moisture and when burned gives off more smoke and pollution than dry wood.It is also harder to set alight, and dficult to burn.Burning wet wood can also lead to a build-up of soot and sticky creosote inside of the burner.Dry wood has usually been dried out in a kiln and has a moisture content of % or less.If you are chopping your own wood to burn, it will need to be dried out for around a year in order to be classied as dry. Some types of wood, such as oak, will require longer.Pieces of wet wood will make a dull thud when knocked together, while you can spot dry wood by looking for cracks, a dull colour and loose bark. The logs will also feel lighter.Dry wood is not only better for the environment, but burning it gives off more heat - making it more efficient, while your stove will require less cleaning and maintenance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Chair of the Business Select Committee Rachel Reeves has joined with the GMB union to warn that something needs to change when full employment in  means working three jobs and job security is almost a “nostalgic throwback”.Based on a series of interviews with workers in Yorkshire, the pamphlet “Everyday Work” argues Labour needs to put work at the heart of its strategy to reconnect with lost voters.Ahead of its launch at a GMB event in Leeds on Saturday, she told the Mirror: “In December, voters across Yorkshire turned away from Labour. The decline of industrial work is a big part of the story of Labour’s decline in many parts of the country. “A story about the economy and work that can bridge some of the isions in our country will be an important part of our road to recovery.” She found that despite sectors like care, retail, and many of our public services playing key roles in our communities, workers are often under-appreciated and have suffered from worsening pay and conditions. Ms Reeves has called for the creation of Royal Colleges in sectors such as social care to make sure the status and expertise of workers is recognised and to give them a role in shaping best practice and improving standards. She said Labour needs an industrial strategy which puts improving work, wages and productivity in sectors like care and retail at its heart combined with a renewed focus on lelong learning and childcare.  She said: “The Government repeatedly point towards the number of people in employment. “But this masks the real story: of a productivity crisis, on the one hand, and on the other of an increasingly raw deal for workers – stagnant and low pay, high insecurity, poor training and progression, and poor work-le balance. “Increasingly, people in the UK are working more but they are working more to keep their quality of le standing still.” Neil Derrick, GMB Regional Secretary, described the recommendations as “vital”.

She said he had asked her step-brother: Whataposs the score  Ms Nandy said the troubled club, which was expelled from the Football League last year over years of financial issues, tells a story about things that are being lost in Britain. She said the failure of the powers that be to step in and save Bury FC from collapse contributed to a feeling in northern towns that politics was pointless and couldnapost change anything.The Labour leadership contender tonight releases a long-form conversation with the Trainspotting director, who was creative director of the  London Olympics opening ceremony.The full conversation can be viewed on Facebook Premiere from pm. Ms Nandy noted the pair had grown up in nearby towns. Mr Boyle was born in Bury and raised in Radclfe, a town around  miles away in Greater Manchester. Ms Nandy said: I went to college in Bury. My step-family still live there, my mum still lives there. Itaposs one of the reasons why in the last few years one of the things thataposs really, really bothered people, not just there but all over the country, is the demise of Bury FC. So my stepdad was a season ticket holder at Gigg Lane. He went from a very, very young age. And he died a couple of years ago, but his last words to my stepbrother were whataposs the score  And my stepbrother always says he wouldnapost have wanted to know the answer. It would have been as usual. But the demise of that football club I think tells a story about things that are being lost in Britain. She said towns like Bury and her Wigan constituency had lost major employers who had supported the community. She said: You had municipal socialism and you often had Labour councils who were controlling council houses and were able to give people council houses that they needed and were able to support all of those big institutions that really matter to people.  She added: And the collapse of Bury and the failure of the powers that be to step in and respond and to protect it I think it was such a big moment for a lot of people. This sense that politics and the system and the establishment not just wonapost change things, but the belief that we canapost change things. Itaposs fuelling this idea thataposs, aposwhataposs the point of you all apos Politics, just thereaposs no point to it all. And I really worry about that. And I wonder, is there away we can reconnect on that emotional level and protect the things that matter to people  That we can hear what matters to people and that we defend them. Mr Boyle remembered his experience in the run up to the Olympics, saying the British people had overcome their natural cynicism, and wanted something to believe in. He said: When we set up the Olympics, I remember there was a lot of cynicism about it. Because it seems to be a default position we have. I’ve had it about other things as well. I’m guilty of it just as much as anyone.  Ms Nandy owned up to suffering from her own northern scepticism. But I remember seeing the torch arrive, Mr Boyle went on. On the telly. And it was like fty days out from it starting And I remember my sister. My twin sister who was a teacher her whole le. She went. I can’t remember where she went. She drove, I can’t remember where it was. She drove miles to stand in the rain in this crowd. He added: This torch running through like that. And it was pouring down. But I remember looking at people’s faces – they want that – they want to come and they want to celebrate something together. You could see that in people’s faces as they stood in the rain waiting for the torch…. And people really want this. They don’t want cynicism. They want something to believe in… And they’ll punish youyou bulls**t them about what to believe in.

A week earlier I’d had surgery to remove what I’d once thought was a harmless lump not far above my knee. I donapost know how long it had been there before I finally went to see a GP. It had never crossed my mind that it would be something dangerous. As it turned out, that GP visit would be the start of a journey that would see me diagnosed with cancer, crying in my bed as I thought about my little girl growing up without her daddy and having a signicant chunk of my leg removed on my th birthday. But things started slowly, around three months earlier. The GP referred me for an ultrasound while assuring me it was probably nothing to worry about and I left the surgery reassured and perfectly happy to wait the several weeks for my scan. I laughed along with a friend when he joked “Iaposve never heard of anyone getting leg cancer”. Things got a bit more serious at the ultrasound, when a radiologist began to rule out some of the innocent, more likely causes for the lump, took a biopsy sample and booked me in for an MRI scan.  By now I was researching online and kept coming back to one word: sarcoma. It’s a malignant tumour that grows in bone or soft tissue anywhere in the body. I’d never heard of it. It makes up just % of cancer diagnoses in the UK. And there are around  dferent sub-types, so even those diagnosed with sarcoma are dealing with radically dferent circumstances. The tumours can, and do, grow anywhere from your head to your feet. They y in how aggressive and large they are when they’re found. And, given they’re painless, their discovery is often by accident. After the MRI and a follow-up CT scan I got the confirmation I didn’t want but was largely expecting: it was sarcoma. It was about the size of a golf ball . And now they needed to checkit had spread to my lungs. It’s hard to describe what goes through your head when you’re waiting to find outyou have secondary lung cancer. I was scared I was about to find out I was now fighting for my le, bewildered at how a painless lump in my leg had come to this and desperately sad at the thought of my little girl not having her dad around much longer. I could barely process the fact it was possible that my pregnant partner would soon be having a second child that I may not know for long.  But alongside that, there was plenty of hope and I’m not sure I ever really believed they were going to find anything in my lungs. I went for the chest CT scan on a Friday night then packed the weekend with things to do with my family and friends, which all passed in a daze in a strange, grey, early January light in which everything and nothing seemed real all at the same time. At one point, my daughter said something innocent as we played which made me run out of the room to secretly burst into tears outside the door with my hand over my mouth. The results came through quickly and were clear. So now it was just a case of getting the tumour out of my leg . So instead of going to the country hotel and spa which had been my original birthday plan, I went to Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where everyone noticed my date of birth and theatre staff made me a card before knocking me out.  It’s four weeks after surgery now and I’m getting closer to being able to walk properly. Before the op, I’d spend weekend mornings doing -mile bike rides, now I’m going through physiotherapy just to be able to bend my leg or lt it off the floor. I don’t know how long it’ll be until I can cycle properly again, or be confident enough to carry my daughter on my shoulders again. But there’s plenty I do know. I know that I will get there and that I don’t feel sorry for myself. I don’t care how my leg looks. I know that right now I no longer have cancer and my prognosis is good. I hope that gives others confidence and hope. Like anyone  who’s been through it, I face years of scans to check it hasn’t come back but there’s no particular reason to fear it will. I know thatyou are worried about a lump anywhere on your body, you need to see a doctor. In most cases, it will turn out to be nothing. In my case it didn’t. I still shudder to think that on another day and in a dferent mood, I may never have booked that GP appointment and would still just be rubbing my strange, painless lump in bemusement. I know I’m not the only one with sarcoma who thought they just had an odd-shaped muscle or a knot in their hamstring.

Tipping the scales at st lbs, Lynne Gaskell, , from Lancashire, was determined to lose weight so she “could be around for longer” to look after her autistic son Joshua. After being told she was pre-diabetic during a full health MOT when she turned , Lynne knew it was time to act. She started researching ways to get into shape and put herself forward for the Second Nature programme, a -week programme which focuses on ‘rewiring’ people’s habits to live healthier lives. She said: The results of the blood test showed I was at risk of type  diabetes and they classed me as pre-diabetic. They said the best thing for me to do was to lose weight. “I didn’t want to join a gym or any of the slimming groups as they didn’t appeal to me. “My son Joshua is autistic and needs a lot of care. He was one of the reasons why it was important to become healthier.” After signing up to the digital-focused plan, Lynne was a set of ‘smart’ scales and an activity tracker that links with the app, allowing her to monitor her weight-loss progress and daily step count.  She was also sent a recipe book, a meal plan and daily motivational articles, and was added to an online peer support group - hosted by a qualied dietitian offering daily advice. The digital aspect meant she still had the motivation to shed the pounds without having to stand up in front of a room of strangers and talk about her weight. She said: I lost weight straight away. It’s really easy to stick to and because I’m eating healthily, my husband, Lee, is too - he’s lost two stone.  “The biggest change I’ve made is creating meal plans and sticking to the meals, using their recipes and keeping a food diary.” She swapped fast food for freshly cooked dishes, including a number of delicious treats like chocolate-covered desserts, muffins and curries. She was also told that nothing was off limits, meaning she could treat herself to the odd glass of wine. She said: “I really don’t feel as though I’m missing out on anything - and I’ve cooked things I wouldn’t normally cook. The things we do like eating, we’ve found an alternative way of cooking them, or substituted it with something . “There’s nothing you can’t have as long as you have it in moderation or that you’re very mindful that what you’re having is a treat.  “On a Friday night, my husband and I will sometimes have a bottle of wine with our neighbours or we’ll enjoy a takeaway - I will choose a healthier option though. “I’ve given some of my recipes to my father-in-law, who is diabetic, and my mother-in-law who is at risk - and she’s lost lbs.” Lynne also started walking every day, slowly at first, beginning with , steps, gradually increasing it to , over the duration of the -week programme. Lynne has stopped an incredible st and now weighs st lbs, saying the weightloss has also helped ease the pain of the arthritis she has in her knee. Sheaposs also bought herself a dog, and walking Aubrey gives her a reason to get out exercising over the weekend.  She said: I’ve wanted a dog all my married le, but my husband always used to say that I would never walk it or take care of it. But after I’d lost a couple of stone, he agreed that I could get a puppy. “I have a beautul chocolate labrador called Aubrey - she’s  weeks now and she is taken for walks all the time. Having a dog helps me to get out at the weekend. “My son is overweight too - because of his autism, he has a very restricted diet and we have to stick to very specic things. So it’s been great for us to take the dog out together for a couple of hours. “I’m now much more active with him over the weekends. But le hasn’t hugely changed - which is a good thing. It just means I have the peace of mind of knowing I will be around for a lot longer for Josh - and be healthier around him.  “I’ve just had my yearly check up and the results from my blood tests is perfect - my sugar levels are fine and I’m no longer at risk of type- diabetes. Second Nature was set up by Chris Edson and Mike Gibbs — both former NHS advisors — to tackle Britainaposs obesity and type- diabetes epidemic. The programme, which offers an effective alternative to fasting, calorie counting and points- based diets, has so far amassed , users and is also being trialled by the NHS. Chris Edson, co-founder of Second Nature, said: “We’ve used our research and insights to create an app that helps you rewire your habits.  “Using smart behavioural science, our app makes it easy for you to form new habits, ones that help you sleep better, eat better and feel better. Habits that help you lose weight, and keep it off. “As habit experts, we know the key to changing them successfully is keeping it up, long-term. So, we stay by your side, in your pocket, helping you keep up these positive changes for good. “In the end, you’ll find you’re not trying to lose weight, you’re not depriving yourself or counting calories, you’re just living better, automatically, every day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum begs pharmaceutical company give","story":"NewsMum begs pharmaceutical company to give her son, , le-saving wonderdrugJoe Barnes mum Lorraine, from Nottinghamshire, is desperate for the drug company Vertex to grant her dying son Trikafta on compassionate grounds - as he cannot currently receive it on the NHSShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnist:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsJoe Barnes mum thinks Trikafta could save his le\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailFor Joe Barnes’ mum, one word means everything. Trikafta. The wonder drug Lorraine believes could save her son’s le. Yesterday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced he has ­accelerated the process to get Trikafta agreed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to treat cystic fibrosis . It’s excellent news for thousands with CF, but has only compounded the agony for Joe’s family. NICE’s planned timelines for assessing the triple combination therapy show they expect to publish their recommendation on December  this year. That will be too late for Joe whose doctors have already begun to talk to his family about starting end-of-le care. So today, Lorraine is making a plea directly to the drug company Vertex to grant her dying son Trikafta now, on compassionate grounds. “Vertex,you have any compassion at all, you won’t let my amazing son die,” Lorraine says. “Help me get Trikafta for Joe… I don’t know what  can help him now.” I first spoke to Lorraine and Joe two years ago in March  when they were fighting for the le-changing drug Orkambi. Joe was  and extremely unwell. Orkambi wasn’t available then on the NHS because of its hefty price tag, and the Barnes family were among those fighting a three-year battle to get Vertex, NHS England and NICE to agree a deal so it could be prescribed in the UK. The Orkambi campaign was ­eventually successful, with the drug finally made available in the UK last October, but campaign group Just Treatment believe up to  people may have died waiting for the row to be resolved.Orkambi helped Joe for a while, but he is now extremely ill again, and all the evidence suggests Trikafta could help. So now his exhausted family are facing another David and Goliath fight for a tiny pill that couldsave their son’s le. Currently, there is no cure for CF and half of people in the UK with it die before they are . The le-limiting condition clogs the lungs with sticky mucus as well as affecting other organs. But in the very few cases in the UK where Trikafta has been made available, they have had almost miraculous results. “Joe is too poorly for a lung ­transplant,” Lorraine says. “He can’t go to school, he gets breathless just going upstairs. He’s suffering with chest pains, coughing up blood, he can’t gain weight, he’s depressed. He’s gone through more in his  years that most people will go through in a letime.” Lorraine says Joe’s doctor is in the process of applying for compassionate Trikafta for her son and seven other patients, but that the ­paperwork is prohibitive. “It took his doctor  hours spread over six weeks to fill in one form,” she says. “If there are eight to apply for that will take  weeks to get through them all and then it’s up to Vertex who gets the drug.” Trikafta campaigners know the drugs are expensive, but say the cost is nothing compared with the cost to the NHS of looking after a child going through end-stage CF. CF accounts for , hospital admissions and over , hospital bed days a year. Treatment can easily take four hours a day including physiotherapy, and patients can be on up to  tablets every day. A spokeswoman for Vertex said: “Triple combination therapy is not yet licensed in the EU, and we are restricted by law in how and to whom we can supply this potential medicine in a compassionate use programme.

The young Scottish mum had her first smear test at the age of , which came back clear. However, women between the ages of  and  are supposed to have the screening three years - and she admits that she ignored NHS letters inviting her for follow-ups because it is not the most pleasant thing. “It was stupidity. I was naive. I just never thought I would get cancer, especially at such a young age, she continued. “It is not the most pleasant thing in the world to go for a smear and I just wasn’t keen to rush back for one but it is only five minutes and it could save your le. “If I had read a story like mine I would have gone for a smear test - that’s why I am trying to reach out to people.I put something about it on Facebook, advising people to go for tests, and so many women have messaged me saying thanks for sharing my story and that they were going to book in for one after reading what happened to me.” Kim eventually sought medical help after she suffered abnormal bleeding for nine months. “I had abnormal bleeding for about nine months I was bleeding pretty much daily. I knew there was something not right, she said. “I went for a smear test, which was the first I’d had in  years, before Christmas. It came back that there were abnormal cells so I had to go into Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline for a biopsy. “I got my diagnosis  days later on February . “The doctor called me into hospital and said ‘I am not going to beat around the bush, I am going to tell you that you have cervical cancer.  “I can’t explain how that felt. As soon as I heard the word ‘cancer’ I didn’t hear anything . I automatically thought ‘I am going to die. The children are going to be left without me’. “It is just as well my partner Dane Paton was with me because I was in such a state of shock. I was numb. It was surreal. “The doctor hopes it is stage  but I won’t know for definite until I get an MRI scan next week when we will see whether it has spread or not.” Kim hopes a hysterectomy and courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy will be able to treat the disease and says she will fight it with everything she has. “I’m absolutely terried in case this doesn’t end well for me. The thought of cancer beating me and me leaving my children behind breaks my heart. I am desperate to kill this cancer before it kills me.” Although she has tried to shield her three younger chilren from her diagnosis, her elder son has asked her: “Is my mummy going to die ” “We’ve told him there is a lot doctors can do but we are not telling the wee ones unless it is terminal. They are not old enough to understand cancer,” she says. But she is adamant that when her two daughters are old enough, she will be drumming home the message of smear testing. Kim is also thankful that with the introduction of HPV immunisations for young girls, the chances of her daughters developing cervical cancer will reduce. “I wish they had that when I was growing up but I am grateful for it for my daughters,” she added. Determined to spend more time with her children, she is now trying to raise funds to pay for alternative CBD oil, a cannabis based alternative medicine, after reading it has been proven to shrink or even clear cancer.

The Prince of Wales laughs and smiled as he sits at the bedside of Maureen Russell at the Marie Curie Hospice in Cardf. The Queenaposs eldest son has stepped in to offer moral support to the people and businesses of South Wales who are suffering after floodwater devastated communities. In the town of Pontypridd, where multiple homes and businesses have been flooded, he laughed and joked with local people who have been keeping their spirits up despite the destruction wrought. A young lad beams as Charles shakes hands with him, while women in raincoats break out laughing as the Prince cracks a joke. One of them leans in to say something in his ear and in another photo, he gives a hooded woman a friendly pat on the arm. Charles unveiled a plaque at the Marie Curie Hospices and signed a petal as part of the Great Daffodil Appeal. He is also meeting with those involved in the rescue and support effort. Meanwhile Boris Johnson continued yesterday to dodge demands to see for himself the devastation unleashed by Storm Dennis.The Prime Minister was also still resisting calls to call a COBRA meeting to coordinate efforts to help householders battered by the mayhem. Firefightersapos leaders also criticised Mr Johnsonaposs response as a “shambles” - and accused him of cowering away. Charles is undertaking several engagements in Wales, and has already had a go at driving Aston Martinaposs new luxury SUV at the car makeraposs factory in St Athan, near Barry.  The heir to the throne arrived at the Aston Martin Lagonda plant in his DB Mark  Volante, which he purchased in November . The vehicle was converted to run on E bioethanol made from by-products of the wine and cheese industries in . After arriving, Charles got into the driveraposs seat of a red DBX - costing from £, - and took it for a -minute test drive on the Aston Martin site.  In a speech to staff, he said: It is a particular pleasure to be able to visit an Aston Martin factory like this having been a very devoted member of the Aston Martin driversapos club for the last  years or more. The wonderful thing was I was able to drive my very old car here in my very old way and to be able to get in and out of it still - just. What was fascinating was to see this new SUV version, the DBX, and to have had a chance to drive it around.I must say it is a great tribute to all your team work and expertise and extraordinary engineering skill which has put this remarkable car together. I just wanted to say that I am full of admiration for the fact that this is Welsh engineering and skill on a very high level. Before making his speech, Charles placed the Aston Martin wings on the front of a brand new DBX. He joked that it was wonky, telling staff: I knew Iaposd get it wrong.  The prince said he had probably made a terrible bosh of the wings, adding that he would attempt to unveil a commemorative plaque without causing a problem. Charles drove the DBX with Ian Hartley, senior manager for vehicle dynamics, who praised his handling of the car. He is a good driver - cautious, Mr Hartley said.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA school bus has been driven past Buckingham Palace carrying a billboard urging the public to ask Prince Andrew to call the FBI. The stunt was reportedly arranged by a lawyer representing Jeffrey Epsteinaposs accusers. The banner on the side of the bus, which includes a picture of the Duke of York, states:“If you see this man please ask him to call the FBI to answer their questions. The poster on the side of the bus also featured the website address for attorney Gloria Allred - who is representing several of Jeffrey Epstein’s accusers. During a press conference in New York last year she said Prince Andrew has an obligation to meet with investigators to disclose what he knew about Epstein.  Onlookers said the bus was pulled over by police in Park Street, close to Hyde Park. An onlooker who spotted the “weird bus” said officers spoke to the driver for around ten minutes before the bus was allowed to drive off. Images of the vehicle have been spotted all over London in a high visibility campaign. Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, also alleges the duke had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was , still a minor under US law. Andrew, who strenuously denies the allegations, has faced calls to talk to the FBI and US prosecutors still investigating Epstein, who committed suicide in jail while facing sex trafficking charges.  The duke was due to be promoted to Admiral on his th birthday, in line with a longstanding policy that sees senior royals treated as serving military members. But Buckingham Palace has already said the duke has asked to defer the promotion until he is able to fully resume royal duties. Earlier this month an open letter written by four of Epsteinaposs alleged victims implores the Duke of York to act now for the sake of his daughters. It says: “Please help the US authorities with anything you may have observed in your time spent with Jeffrey Epstein. “Do it for the victims who have lived a le of suffering... and humiliation. “You can make things better for us and for future generations with your co-operation. Do it for your daughters and their children. “You have a chance to be on the right side of history. The world is watching.” The prince has vehemently denied her accusations, saying in a BBC interview in November that the alleged sexual incidents “never happened”.  Days after the broadcast Andrew, , quit public le “for the foreseeable future” because of his “former association” with Epstein.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA global jetsetter has revealed how she went from being a skint student to earning over £, a month virtually overnight. Kaya Corbridge quit her degree in international relations to sell nude pictures and saucy videos of herself online. Raking in  times the average annual UK salary of £, at just , singleton Kaya owns her house in Colne, Lancashire, outright and holidays in far flung destinations such as Bali, Barcelona and Australia. Her luxury lestyle became possible after she quit her degree course in international relations and global development at Leeds Beckett University in September , after just four weeks, to focus on her OnlyFans account - a subscription service where content creators provide exclusive material to their subscribers, or fans. Kaya explained how her content - which fans pay a fee to view - can range from naked pictures to videos of her feet, saying: I set-up my OnlyFans account on a bit of whim. I just thought I’d give it a go – I never thought it would change my le in the way it has. “In my first year I made £, and now I earn about £, every month – I’m in the top one per cent of OnlyFans earners in the world. Le before her saucy endeavours was far from luxurious for Kaya - who also provides additional favours for fans, which can include rating pictures of menaposs intimate parts. Her previous jobs have included being a cash-in-hand waitress at , working in McDonaldaposs, Lidl and as a part-time tour operator. But now Kaya, who has a brother and two sisters who she prefers to keep anonymous, says money is no object, adding: Last year I bought my first house and paid for it outright. It cost £, and it’s lovely. Itaposs got two bedrooms, a kitchen, two bathrooms, a balcony and a garden and itaposs made me want to buy a second property soon. But Iaposm hardly there, as I spend most of my time travelling the world.  I love exploring and seeing new places and I love being my own boss, as I can still work from wherever I am in the world. Since I started OnlyFans I’ve visited  countries, I’ve taken my mum to Paris, Poland and Barcelona, and I spent a few months in Australia. I travelled in America, saw more of Europe, then went to Bali and now I’m travelling around South East Asia. Iaposm hoping to have been to  countries by the end of the year.OnlyFans content providers like Kaya have a photo feed, like Instagram users, showing pictures but she also takes private requests.For private requests people can pay for nude pictures and videos of me and some more naughty things, too, like strip teases. Thereaposs acalled Strip for Tip, and during a live video the more money my subscribers send me the more clothes Iaposll take off. “I usually post once a day - a mixture of pictures and videos - but the most time-consuming part of the job is making sure I reply to everyone’s messages. I can get hundreds in a day and it can take hours to reply to them all.” Despite her enviable curves, Kaya says many of her fans - who are mainly men but also some women and couples - just want to focus on her feet. She said: People have a real thing for feet. I’ve made thousands from mine!  Sometimes, they just ask for pictures of them - or theyaposll want videos of me rubbing oil on them, or of me just walking along in the sand. Itaposs easy money. Men also pay me to rate their privates. Theyaposll send me a pic, then Iaposll tell them what I think of it in exchange for money. Plus thereaposs the girlfriend experience. Men ask me to speak to them asIaposm their girlfriend for one day and pay me for it. I chat through messages or voice notes. Usually, theyaposll tell me what type of girlfriend they want me to be. Honestly, it would blow peopleaposs mindsthey heard what some men ask for - but I just let it go over my head. She has turned down some of her fansapos more lurid requests for items of worn underwear, to shave her hair off and, on one occasion, to put a slice of bread in her shoe, walk around on it all day and send a male admirer her crumbs. She also has fans who want to gt items to her, which she says can be very useful. Kaya, who did her own poll to determine the profile of her fans, which she believes are mostly men in their s or s, said: For fans who want to give me gts, I have a aposWish List.apos All I do is add items that I want to it, so they can go and buy them for me. I ask for all sorts, usually just boring every day items. My brother needed a new mattress recently, so I added it to my list, and someone bought it.  When I moved into my house, I asked for things like a kettle and microwave, as well as candles and cushions - and got those gted too. Iaposve also been given a phone, trainers, clothes, vouchers and books. Sometimes Kayaaposs fans use their initiative and buy her surprise presents. I get sent outfits that people want me to wear on camera, she said. Iaposve been sent a policewoman and a nurse outfit before, as well as a tutu, fishnet tights and a corset. I also had rope sent to me. I was just like, aposSo, what am I meant to do with this apos The next day a book arrived which was called aposThe Art of Rope Tying,apos so Iaposm guessing they wanted me to tie myself up in rope. Her fans can also help to maintain Kayaaposs immaculate appearance. “There’s acalled ‘Adopt a Billapos, she said. Using that, people can pay for me to get things like get my nails or toes painted.  “Orsomething crops up – likeI need to go to the dentist – they can pay for that, too. “I have extensions, which can cost a small fortune to maintain, so sometimes, I ask for contributions for my hair.” Looking back to September  when she first opened her account, Kayaaposs le now is unrecognisable. “For those couple of weeks when I was at university I was as poor as hell and could barely afford to eat,” she said. “I was always worried about money, my parents didn’t have a lot, but they scraped together all they could to give me an extra £ a week. “I remember being in tears because my laptop basically blew up and I couldn’t afford to fix it.Her le changed in an instant, however, when, browsing Twitter one day, Kaya found someone with an OnlyFans account and decided to follow suit and start her own.She said: I set it up, then forgot about it for a while. A few days later I uploaded a bikini picture of myself to see what happened. When I woke up the next day, I checked my account and Iaposd made £ overnight - I couldnapost believe it! After that, she continued to post intimate images and videos to the website.  Within the first month Iaposd made £,, she said. I knew I was on to something good, so I decided to quit my university course and concentrate on OnlyFans. To be honest, I only went to university because I wanted to get a charity job doing international aid. “Now I can volunteer for charities while still earning a wage through OnlyFans. So last year, one day I told my fans, ‘Whatever I earn today Iaposll donate to Pendle Dogs in Need’, which is a rescue and rehome centre, and I made over £, that I donated to them. She added: In January I volunteered at a dog rescue centre in Ko Samui in Thailand for a couple of weeks - I loved it, and I hope to do some more volunteering soon. Meanwhile, Kayaaposs online work is fully supported by her loved ones. “My family and friends are happy for me and so supportive of what I do,” she said. “I’ve been honest with them the whole time. As soon as I posted my first photo, I told them what I was doing.

Incredibly no one has ever lived in the property - or knows whataposs inside. The remarkable home comprises of a single sq ft room with no doors. It boasts one long window at the front overlooking a river and with far-reaching town views over picturesque Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. But there is one major setback, as thereaposs no way to access the flat, meaning no one knows whataposs inside. Despite its limitations it sold at auction by Norfolk-based auctioneers William H Brown, with an initial guide price of £. There is no record of anyone ever having used it or lived there and it is suspended above an alleyway - with no way to even reach it. But this guide price dropped to £ at the last minute - and a local unnamed businessman snapped it up. The contents and condition of the unusual property remain a mystery as even the auctioneers were unable to access it. When it first went on their books, auctions partner Victoria Reek described it as certainly one of the weirdest ones weaposve had at auction, and admitted it was probably just full of cobwebs.The unusual property, located at - Nene Quay, is in a terrace of old buildings, believed to have been built as granaries or shops in the th century. Today, it sits between Tasty China restaurant at number , and Bridge Insurance office next door. Fenland District Council, which has owned it since , put it up for sale alongside other surplus properties with Norwich-based auctioneers William H Brown. The auctioneers said it was the cheapest they had ever seen a property sell for. But the buyer will actually have paid more in fees than the actual price of the property, paying around £, in total and no doubt paid for the lot in full rather than simply putting a deposit down.  The auction details state: This is an opportunity to acquire a flying freehold which extends over part of a vehicular access passageway and comprises a single, currently inaccessible room, measuring approximately  sqm. There is limited information and we have not, at this stage, gained access. A aposflying freeholdapos means it has no structure underneath but extends over a passageway. Flying freeholds are most common where an older, large building has been converted into a number of smaller properties. At some point the room may have belonged to the building next door but somehow got separated over time.  Clf Humphreys, a senior insurance broker at Bridge Insurance Services which adjoins the single-room property, said he is disappointed with the council for letting the property go for just £.The -year-old, who previously made a £ offer on the property, said: It has become a joke. They have turned it into a laughing stock. I was trying to be sensible about it, and come to an amicable agreement with them. Prior to the auction I made them an offer of £, which they accepted, but on the condition that I completed within  days, and paid £ in legal fees. I thought, Iaposm not going to do that. And now it has been sold to some idiot at auction for just £.I donapost know who the vendor is, but I would like to speak to him. Heaposs never going to get access to the property through my office. I wonapost allow it. Clf bought the building which now houses Bridge Insurance Services in  - but says he has never seen inside the single-room aposfloating freeholdapos. But he said: For all intents and purposes, it is part of my property. If I were to ever sell this building or turn it into flats, it would be another bit of space for me to utilise. The council have been irrational and a bit stupid in the way they have dealt with all of this. I certainly donapost want to get caught up in this comedy of errors - I just wanted to come to a quiet agreement with the council over the room. He added: I think the man who bought it has been a bit of a fool.

From out of nowhere the dog bolts from the road into the car park upon seeing the girl who is skipping happily, blissfully unaware of what is about to happen. She is walking with her dad and holding a womanaposs hand but the dog moves at lightning speed in and gets between him and his daughter, beginning to try and tear at the poor little girlaposs arm. The girl is aged just five and the panicking adults begin a desperate struggle to wrestle the mad dog off her. She had just been to church and all was well when the dog started the attack and knocked her to the ground. Her dad held papers in his hand as the family serenely walked to their car before the creature struck at full speed. It would be the last thing the dog ever did - its owner gave it up to be put down. A humane society in Colorado shared the terrying video, and revealed the dogaposs owner was charged with Unlawful Ownership of a Dangerous Animal. The humane society said: Although our goal is to save as many lives as we can, some pets are simply not safe to be in the community. To prevent bites and attacks, pet owners need the basic tenets of responsible pet ownership — spaying and neutering to prevent roaming, keeping your pet restrained at all times, and seeking professional training before a behavior escalates.  The video, shared as a warning to others, shows the dogaposs owner was nowhere to be seen and the mutt was off leash. In the chaos of the vicious attack the girl is dragged around the hard concrete floor of the car park by her arm with the adults trying to prize the muttaposs jaws from her. Brave bystanders jump in to help - a woman leaps out a truck and another man runs to help. They lt the girl up off the ground and a fth man tries to help - but to no avail.

The pair, who have a  year age gap, met on a website that puts women in touch with sugar daddies. But they say what started as a purely financial situation has now developed into true love - even though Grant is three years older than -year-old Sabrinaaposs dad. Sabrina, who is studying psychology and art therapy, loves to wear candy pink wigs and dresses in doll-like outfits. Meanwhile, Grant, , is semi-retired. Sabrina  said: I met Grant on the sugar daddy, sugar baby website initially for financial reasons. I thought I would just find a sugar daddy but now it’s for love, it’s not for money. “When society sees us walking they think, ‘Oh I wonder how much money he gives her, she’s only in it for the money’.” Grant added: “I was surprised to find true love online. I really didn’t expect it at all. He said: “In terms of being called a sugar daddy, I am a little bit anti being called that because of the men who have taken it in the wrong direction. Where itaposs just strictly money transfers for brief interludes of companionship, so thataposs really not my goal or direction, so Iaposm really not truly a sugar daddy.” Grant had dated other women he met on the site but admits he had mixed success. He says he would often “mostly just pay for dates” as well as trialling monthly allowance arrangements but the women “would disappear and reappear maybe the last day of the month. But both Sabrina and Grant say that when they met, they clicked instantly.  Sabrina explained: “It’s like any other relationship like anyone  my age or older, I’m really happy. We clicked right away. “We just got to know each other and the more we got to know each other the more that I just liked him as a person, it wasn’t superficial.” Grant added: “We kind of put money aside, we didn’t even care about money.” Sabrina says her relationship with Grant is completely dferent to sugar daddies she has met in the past. She added: Some men that I saw were unattractive, I wasn’t attracted to them so it was just about the money. He makes me so happy. He really does. Itaposs not transactional, itaposs not about money. He just treats me like a princess. He really does. And I tried to treat him like the diamond he is. So I try to respect him. So heaposs my diamond daddy. But not everyone approves of their relationship. Sabrinaaposs -year-old dad, who she lives with, has serious reservations.  She said: “Unfortunately my mom is no longer here, but my dad, he doesn’t approve. He’s still stubborn. He does not approve of it. I don’t really tell him a lot about it.“I noticedI post a picture of me and Grant on Facebook, my friends will like it but my family wonapost like the picture.”Grant was previously married and has three children himself and although they know about how Grant and Sabrina met, it’s not something they openly discuss. He added: “If you asked them, they would say they know, we donapost discuss it or the pros and cons of it on my behalf.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad leaves child 14 airport","story":"NewsDad leaves child, , at airport with expired passport and goes away without herA dad left his -year-old daughter at the airport after they discovered she only had two months left on her passport, and still went away without herShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe father made the decision to leave his daughter at the airport \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

His -year-old daughter from a previous relationship had already been on holiday overseas with her mum but his two younger children had never been abroad. It meant they had brand new passports for the trip while his eldest daughter had used hers before. The dad explained that when he asked his ex-partner to fill in his daughteraposs passport details online, she refused and would only give him the expiry date. After confirming that it had one year, the father and his we  went ahead and booked the exciting trip. Everything was going to plan until disaster struck when they got to the airport. It was when they queued to pick up their tickets, that he learnt that his -year-old daughteraposs passport was due to expire in two months time. This meant the airline wouldnapost let her fly as it was their policy for passengers to have at least six months left on their passports. The expensive holiday was non-refundable and to make matters more complicated the dadaposs we said she would cancel the entire triphe wasnapost with her. She insisted she wouldnapost be able to handle travelling overseas with the two youngest children for the first time alone. After discussing the situation with his we, the dad decided to go on the trip with her and his two youngest children - leaving his eldest daughter alone at the airport. The dad explained: Naturally, my daughter was very upset and I promised to take her on another trip once her passport was renewed but obviously that wasnapost going to make her feel better. He then arranged for his dad to pick up his daughter from the airport. The dad admitted that he was miserable knowing that I had left my daughter behind. He added that heaposd been sent text messages from people back home questioning their decision. When the family came back from the holiday, his daughter refused to see or talk to him.

at palmerston park","story":"Dundee’s recent trips to Palmerston haven’t been too successful but the Dark Blues of  have their sights set on changing that this time around.The Dens men have managed just the one victory in their last nine trips to Queen of the South – a - win on their way to the Championship title in  thanks to a Ryan Conroy penalty – stretching back over the last decade.However, even from the last meeting in September, there could be considerable changes to the way James McPake sets his side out as he plots a way to double that win rate.The clash on a Friday night on TV saw Jordan McGhee net his first goal for the Dark Blues with a fine header after Queens striker Jack Hamilton had beaten his namesake in the Dundee goal early on.That was a disappointing night for the Dens gaffer as his side struggled to find their feet in the Championship.And he’ll be hoping this version of the Dark Blues can show there’s been some good work done in the time since.After another poor spell at the start of the year, Dundee have put together two positive displays to earn a point at Mortonand win convincingly at home to Partick Thistle last time out.Should boss James decide to stick with the same line-up and -- formation, there will only be four names remaining on the team sheet from the autumn.Of the team that saw off the Jags last time out, only Jordon Forster, Declan McDaid, Graham Dorrans and Kane Hemmings featured in the last trip down to Dumfries.McGhee grabbed the goal that day but he and Cammy Kerr are both recovering from surgery and Saturday may come too soon for them.And with the three-man defence working so well with Christophe Berra added in against Thistle, the Dens gaffer might be tempted to stick rather than twist.That’s likely to see Josh Meekings retain his place also with McDaid filling in at left wing-back and Christie Elliott on the right.Of the midfield three, Dorrans is a stick-on to start, barring any injury problems, while Shaun Byrne has been impressing in training in recent weeks and showed up well against the Jags.The big decision for James is who to put in the place of Ross Callachan.The on-loan midfielder had injected dynamism to the middle of the park and was unlike anything  in the squad.That could see Paul McGowan drop back to a deeper role after stepping in as a makesht striker last week.And Callachan’s energy could be replaced by fit-again Andrew Nelson after he ed from surgery to his hand for the closing stages last time out.Another certainty, barring injury, is Kane Hemmings as he targets moving his goal tally into double figures for the season. vw, px\"  The Doonhamers will have a dferent look about them as well with three key players having left in the winter window.On-loan

disappointed by their recent run, particularly in the league where they are without a win in three after last week’s - draw at Alloa, as they welcome Inverness to Tannadice tonight.However, he points to their -point lead at the top of the Championship and previous -game unbeaten run as proof they have the quality and mentality to get back to winning ways.“We were disappointed and there were a few discussions after the Alloa game about certain things,” the Irishman said.“Recently, in the last three league games, we haven’t done as well as we had before. We’ve picked up a few points but we’re not where we were.“I don’t feel like we’ve let that bother us, though. Now we’ve got the mentality to focus on the next game. Tonight we’ve got Inverness, who I feel will come out and play against us, so it will be an open and enjoyable game.“We’ve been training hard all week after last weekend and it’s just keeping that mindset of continuing on.“That’s been the big change at the club – how we react and how we deal with certain situations.“We’ve shown it before and we’ll do it again.“We’ve set high standards and when you don’t meet them you get disappointed.“It’s certainly not something that’s lingering around us. We speak about it because we’ve got a tight-knit group and we can be open with our opinions.“Once it’s said and done it’s straight back to the drawing board.“It’s a normal week whether we win, lose or draw. We drew and didn’t concede so we have to take the positives.“We go again against Inverness tonight. We’re  points clear and we want to keep it that way and open the gap as much as we can.“Hopefully we can. Like we keep saying in the dressing-room, all we can do is keep focusing on ourselves and winning games. We’ve done brilliantly this season and at the startyou told us we’d be  points clear at this point we’d be delighted.“It’s an incredible thing but we also know what football’s like and how, at this time of the season, everyone is still fighting for something.”Connolly reckons theof Paul McMullan and Louis Appere to the fold tonight is a huge boost for the Tangerines as they enter the final third of the season.Speaking about the squad’s injury problems, the -year-old added: “If you look at it it’s boys that, throughout the season, have been big players for us going forward.“They’ve provided a lot of goals and assists.

We are building towards next season already as well.“As long as the strikers stay fit.“There are always ‘what-s’ but we have Andrew Nelson back and Paul McGowan can play up there when he needs to.“Strength-wise I do think we are better now than we were going into the Partick game as a squad.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"acha holds annual tenants and members conference","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArgyll Community Housing Associationheld its annual tenants and members conference in Inveraray.Themes covered at the conference focused on three areas # involving young people, improving performance and investing in your home.The session on involving young people included presentations from Iona MacDonald and Hannah Nicolson, trainees with ACHA and Argyll and Bute Council respectively.

The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this. Young people like her give me hope for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"john-muir-house-car-park-opened-public","story":"The car park, off Court Street, is home to about  spaces but can only be used by council employees and council HQ visitors between am and pm during the working week.That could soon change, with a number of spaces potentially being made available for public weekday daytime use.The idea comes as the council looks to increase the overall number of short and long stay car parking spaces in and around the town centre.Last year, discussions took place with members of the public surrounding the idea of creating a lsquotransport hubrsquo off the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.Now, a further two-day consultation is taking place in Haddington Town House, when members of the public can discuss parking issues in the town.The consultation will focus on parking throughout Haddington, including possibly changing the long-stay car park near the townrsquos Tesco store into a short-stay car park.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoFor many years, wersquove been keen to enhance the town centre so that it offers the best possible environment for all users ndash including people with restricted mobility, pedestrians and cyclists ndash to ensure easy access to the local services and businesses on which Haddington depends.ldquoAs well as improved options for active travel and public transport, we recognise there is a need to create more parking spaces in and around the town centre.ldquoFor this to happen, we need to change some existing parking from long stay to short stay, and deliver a new long-stay parking option for drivers who need to leave their vehicle in the town throughout the working day.ldquoOne proposal is the potential re-designation of the existing lsquoTesco long-stayrsquo car park, which could free up an additional  spaces in the town centre for short-stay, public parking.ldquoWe will also review the status of the car park at John Muir House, East Lothian Councilrsquos head office, to consider the potential for an area here to be available for wider public use.More than  people attended the previous exhibition in the Town House.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes.

The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough.

David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him.

What was he thinking when he walked out the door  Did nobody call him back and suggest he change into something better  News of Manchester City being slapped with a two-year UEFA ban would have been at the forefront of his mind, I know, but thatrsquos no justication for his down-at-heel appearance. Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age. What baffles women is why, with such a simple formula for success ndash unlike the minefield of female fashion ndash there are still so many men dressing badly."},{"url":null,"title":"george-washington-attempted-recruit-scottish-farmers-replace-slovenly-americans","story":"In a three-page letter to David Erskine, the th Earl of Buchan, Washington indicates his desire to move on from growing tobacco and enslaved labour in favour of producing wheat under the watch of tenant farmers.The letter, dated February , , shows Washington planning for his le as an estate owner after the presidency - which he gave up a year later.:Historic violin played to young Robert Burns to tour USIt was discovered in the University of Edinburgh archives and is thought to have been donated to the institution by antiquarian Sir David Lang in the s.Washington had previously kept slaves and grown tobacco at his Mount Vernon estate in Fairfax County, Virginia, however had sought to move into wheat when it became a more profitable crop.The president never expressly attempts to poach Scottish workers, which would have been illegal at the time, but does share an advert he placed in a US newspaper for vacancies on the estate and suggests any workers looking for an abundance of land should contact himthey are ldquoon the move to the United States.He demonstrates knowledge of the emerging discipline of agricultural science in Scotland ndash a by-product of Scottish Enlightenment thinking ndash and read deeply on the subject.The letters were uncovered in the University of Edinburghs archivesOn future plans for his estate, Washington writes: \"I have but little expectation I own, of maturing this plan so as to carry it into full effect next year nor would I wish to do it with the slovenly farmers of this country,I had a well founded hope of obtaining this class of Men from any otherwhere husbandry is well understood, and the language similar.\"He is also careful to skirt round fractious relations between Britain and America - who would go to war again  years later.Frank Cogliano, Professor of American History at the University of Edinburgh, said: ldquoThe Enlightenment is often referred to as a lsquoRepublic of Lettersrsquo and exchanges such as those between Washington and Buchan were the social networks of their day ndash not only swapping ideas but advertising opportunities.

Morrissey supports the right-wing group For Britain. And Andrew Sabisky has said he believes in compulsory contraception to avoid creating a permanent underclass. Itrsquos perfectly reasonable to think, isnrsquot it, that people who hold such views do not deserve a place in public le. And yoursquore free not to buy Singerrsquos books, and not to go to Morrisseyrsquos concerts, and yoursquore free to call for Sabisky to be sacked and to be pleased when he effectively is.But should we be worried about this so-called cancel culture  What its critics say is that itrsquos closing down free speech. It is apparently not enough to unfollow someone on social media, or stop buying their albums or books. The person being cancelled must also be removed from office, or public places. If they have a job, sack them. If theyrsquore speaking at an event, call it off. The critics call it mob rule and trial-by-media and say its an attempt to erase certain opinions.But is it really  Letrsquos look at what happened to Sabisky, Singer, and Morrissey this week, because to ying degrees theyrsquove all been ldquocancelled. Sabisky resigned from the British Government because of what he called ldquoold stuff online. In Singerrsquos case, a venue in New Zealand cancelled an event he was due to speak at because, they said, of concerns raised by the public. As for Morrissey, it was revealed many people seem to be staying away from his concerts in the UK, possibly because of his opinions.All of this is a form of cancelling in a way, and there are some elements of it that are unsubtle at best. Take Peter Singer, for example. Irsquove spoken to Professor Singer in the past about this and his views on disability, while controversial, are part of a deeply considered philosophy that seeks to balance the competing interests in society. Irsquove also interviewed Morrissey and my impression there is that some of his behaviour is about being contrary and some of it is about being conservative ndash he has always been concerned about immigration andyou didnrsquot hear that in his songs, you werenrsquot really listening.The point is therersquos no consistency to cancelling. Some commentators say itrsquos part of a new conspiracy to suppress right-wing opinion, but that certainly doesnrsquot apply to Peter Singer ndash hersquos a Marxist. The idea of ldquocancelling is also far from new I remember Professor Singer telling me about the demonstrations against him when he joined the staff at Princeton University in the s. Opinions have always come with consequences.The critics of cancelling say the problem comes when the consequences are losing your job or being hounded out of public places, but cancelling is really just a form of hitting out at, or avoiding people, or things, you donrsquot like. Itrsquos happened to me. Occasionally, a reader of The Herald has said they avoid reading my column because of my opinions. Itrsquos a form of cancelling and thatrsquos fine.I have also cancelled people myself. On social media, I have hidden or blocked people who get on my nerves and Irsquove cancelled people in real le too. On one occasion, I wrote to a friend whorsquod done something I considered shocking and told him I never wanted to speak to him again and I avoid speaking to people I donrsquot like. Donrsquot we all  Itrsquos cancelling. Itrsquos le.Itrsquos also unrealistic to think that you can avoid that part of le. Ifyou express an opinion, you have to deal with how others might feel about it. You also have to accept your views may disqualy you from some jobs, in a school say, or a church, or Downing Street. You are free to express your opinion but other people are free to react to it.And do not worry about opinions being suppressed. Peter Singer found another venue for his event. Morrissey will continue to release albums. And people like Sabisky will be offered plenty of opportunities to express their views by newspapers and think-tanks. They may have been cancelled by some people, and in that moment their freedom of speech has been compromised. But freedom of speech cannot mean freedom from consequences or reaction. We all have the right to speak. But we also have the right to stop listening."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-repatriation-flight-delayed-saturday","story":"More than  British nationals who have been quarantined on board the Diamond Princess were due to fly home on Friday, but they will now leave the cruise ship on Friday night, and the flight will depart in the early hours of Saturday, local time, the PA news agency understands.:Coronavirus: UK couple on cruise fear they tested positiveThe passengers are due to land at Boscombe Down Ministry of Defence base, near Salisbury in Wiltshire.The Diamond Princess was carrying more than , people in early February when  passengers were diagnosed with the Covid- strain of the disease.Although given the all-clear in Japan, those on Fridayrsquos evacuation flight will be taken straight to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral for  days of quarantine.Since being kept on board the cruise liner in the port of Yokohama, a total of  passengers and crew have been infected, accounting for more than half of all the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China.:Praise for Scotlandrsquos response to coronavirus outbreakThe four Britons on board the Diamond Princess who have tested positive for coronavirus will not be on the flight.David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, have been documenting their time on the quarantined ship on Facebook.The couple are now being treated in a Japanese hospital after spending days shut in their cabin following their diagnosis.Mr Abel admitted he was initially sceptical about whether his diagnosis was accurate, but has since confirmed both he and his we have tested positive.In his latest post, Mr Abel said: ldquoFull health inspection and now we know whatrsquos going on.

That was six years ago.Painstaking stop-start rehearsals for the trio of dads at the cavernous Carlton Studios in Glasgow led to a debut EP which spawned Youre The Bomb three years later, that made my Best Scots Tunes of  list and served to indicate that they might just have something.If they began as a part-mash up of Radiohead and Bloc Party with a fragile heart, their long-awaited debut album shows a ersity that they have only hinted at before, perhaps a reaction to all the, privately disliked, Thom Yorke comparisons.They kick off with a bang. Crime of the Century was the bands first single off the album, and probably their most blatant attempt at pop, which actually turns into a four-minute surf-rocking aural voyage through a forgotten spaghetti western.If the band prefer not to be identied alongside any popular beat combo which has head and radio in their name, then the engaging Last People On Earth propels them away into twisted Wedding Present territory, at least the predominant rf does.:Video -New Scots band The Wild Places share the ten songs that most influenced themWhile you know what to expect, say, from a Lewis Capaldi album, Wires takes you on a far dferent journey, from deep melancholy, to hope and even anger, while the band musically blast off in dferent directions. Its a thrilling ride.The recruitment of recording guru Steven Wardhas helped to further expand the soundscape beyond the original guitar-drums-bass axis, and keep the trio with a semblance of direction.Nevertheless the delightfully dynamic Light The Way takes the loud-soft-loud axis and then cheats by ending just when you expect the crescendo. More is less, I guess.Fergus may not have employed his newswriting skills in his tantalisingly oft abstract lyrics employed in the pounding Little White Lies with its \"Ill take you down,its the last thing I do\" hook and enticing baggy beat. It may sound like it is about infidelity but it is actually about \"the overwhelming power of obsessive love and the line between constructive and destructive relationships\". Not a million miles off.The idea of moulding reggae and prog-rock might seem a fools errand, but the breezy Ghosts On Every Corner really works.There is a feeling that the band themselves are not sure when they are at their best.The debut EP highlight This Is How, wasthe last song , and their big anthem here arrives at track nine out of . The cinematic Fear City has everything that make this band so exciting, a flicker of desolation, a hint of regret and lost love, a smidgeon of optimism, cunning guitar work, dramatic percussion, thrusting bass and a soaring, spinetingling Thom Yorkevocal pay-off, that comes half way through rather than, as you would expect, at the end.The less immediate Hello Monster and In The Dying Light in the second half of the album, are suffocated against the other more compelling nine tracks here, but fit neatly into the sheer eclecticism on offer.:Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  The towering finale comes in the shape of Black Sky, a surprisingpiano-led ballad with its \"Im lted up, into the atmosphere\" hook which even finds room for a delicate drum n bass and an unexpected power-drum before drting off into the ether.It is no wonder the band picked Danish artist Trine Bork Christensen for the cover artwork.Like the album it is sometimes dark, partly colourful, always twisting, quite hypnotic and ultimately magical.And all this from a home-recorded LP. Theres no place like it.What do the band say Ewan said: ldquoWe love recording and are used to working in the time-pressured environment of a professional studio where time is money and everything can get pretty stressful.ldquoWith these songs we didnrsquot want that, we wanted to really take our time and make the record we knew we had in us. So thanks to our very patient families we took about  months and basically did everything at home. Even Timrsquos pretty full on massive drum sound was recorded in my living room with a full drum kit, which my very kind family and cat were good enough to put up with. It was hilarious.

When Steven told me he was up for working with us again, I thought -wersquove really got to go for this!ldquoI think the results speak for themselves, which is absolutely the core philosophy behind the band - itrsquos all about letting the music do all the talking.ldquoWe also had the privilege to work with a fantastic Danish artist Trine Bork Christensen who made lots of incredible unique artwork for our music.

Terns are known to be highly iable in breeding numbers and it is too early to saythis trend is going to continue.Scotlandrsquos breeding seabirds are of international importance. A total of  species of seabird regularly breed in Scotland and they are not only vulnerable to changes in the countryrsquos seas.Many migrate across the Atlantic and technology is beginning to improve scientistsrsquo understanding of their movements.A UK wide seabird census is currently underway and the results from this will help to provide an overview on all of the species of seabirds breeding around Scotland.Offering grounds for hope, Mr Foster said that puffins, one of the countryrsquos most popular marine species, were among the biggest winners after the eradication of predators.He also highlighted early signs that populations of wading birds have received a boost following the removal of mink.ldquoOn the islands where eradications have happened, we are seeing population increases for some species, he said.ldquoPrimarily its the chicks and eggs they predate on but for birds that burrow, like puffins, they predate the adults as well.ldquoWe have seen increases for puffins on the Shiants and also big increases for puffins on Canna after the removal of rats.ldquoAmerican mink have also been an issue, particularly on the islands around Argyll and the west coast, but there are efforts ongoing to remove mink from these places.ldquoWhere mink have been removed in local areas, we are seeing some improvements, not only with seabirds but with waders as well."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-governments-education-reputation-in-tatters-exam-analysis-saga","story":"Conservatives say that saga has left the Scottish Governmentrsquos reputation on education ldquoin tatters.After the  school exam results were published by the Scottish Government in August, Education Secretary John Swinney insisted that yearly iations are to be ldquoexpected. But opposition politicians questioned the reaction to the results, pointing the finger at budget cuts, the number of teachers and subject choice.It was then revealed in September  that Mr Swinney told his officials to privately draw up in-depth analysis of the failures, despite publicly moving to reassure the public over the statistics.:John Swinney: More time needed for exam improvements after pass rate dropIn the same month, the Scottish Government called for a full review of the senior phase of education in secondary schools ndash following a scathing report by MSPs.The Scottish Parliamentrsquos education committee concluded there had been a narrowing of the subject choices which were on offer for some pupils. Education Secretary John Swinney said the review would identy any areas for improvement.In January, Nicola Sturgeon defended Mr Sweeney over claims he secretly ordered an inquiry into the falling Higher pass rates.At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw quizzed Ms Sturgeon over an investigation requested by Mr Swinney in the wake of the slump in pass rates.Ms Sturgeon said the Education Secretary had told Holyroodrsquos Education Committee about his plans for a review in November and the Scottish Government would ldquopublish findings as and when we have them.Addressing suggestions Mr Swinney had ldquosecretly called for the review, she said the Scottish Conservatives were ldquoflatly wrong.Ms Sturgeon agreed that a wider inquiry into Scottish education will take place after opposition politicians teamed up to demand one.Journalist and lecturer James McEnaney submitted a Freedom of Information request for the analysis information in August last year - sparking the six-month fight with Scottish Government officials for its release.Mr McEnaney has accused officials of attempting to ldquosneak out bad news.Speaking on the BBCrsquos Good Morning Scotland programme on Friday, he said: ldquoItrsquos hard to see this in any other light than an attempt to sneak out what is a fairly uncomplimentary documentation.So last night ScotGov quietly published a report on the  exam results,  minutes after releasing the material to me as part of a -month FOI battle. Here are some before-and-after images of the material that is now unredacted: pic JDOhVmtGzldquoWhen they first responded, I got some fairly thoroughly redacted briefing documents ndash they refused to hand over some on cost grounds.He added: ldquoThere were a couple of extra FOIs and each one was getting appealed so that has taken six months to get to the point where finally the stuff that I was ultimately looking for, wersquove managed to get hold of.Also speaking on Good Morning Scotland, Mr Swinney denied the Scottish Government was attempting to hide from scrutiny.He said: ldquoWe had a Freedom of Information request that had to be responded to. So we felt it appropriate, because so much of that material was included in the report that I promised I would publish, that we just published all of it at the same time.:Horror show as damning Scottish exams report is unveiledldquoWe did that in order to make sure we fulfilled the commitments we made to Parliament that this information would be published.The Tories have now accused the Scottish Government of attempting to duck responsibility for the tumbling pass rates.Scottish Conservative shadow education secretary, Jamie Greene, said: ldquoThese revelations are a matter of grave concern to every parent, teacher and young person.ldquoJohn Swinney was told by his civil servants back in August that there were serious issues about the downturn in Higher passes for four consecutive years yet he told us that there was nothing to worry about.ldquoHe said Scottish schools had produced a lsquostrong set of resultsrsquo and that the downturn was due to lsquoannual iationrsquo.ldquoThat was patently not true and this information proves it.Mr Greene added: ldquoWhat is worse is the fact that, on several occasions since August, John Swinney has not come clean to either the Scottish Parliament or to the Education Committee about the reasons for the problems.:Nicola Sturgeon refutes claims of secret investigation into falling Higher pass rateldquoThe Scottish Conservatives asked both him and the First Minister on several occasions to provide this information but it was never forthcoming.ldquoThe SNPrsquos record on schooling has always been poor but this latest episode leaves its reputation in tatters.ldquoEven when faced with these terrible figures, the SNP is still trying to spin its way out of this.ldquoInstead of addressing the failings and improving things, ministers want to pull the wool over the eyes of the public ndash thatrsquos a complete disgrace."},{"url":null,"title":"have your say on future of library services","story":"A series of open public engagement events will be held in libraries throughout Aberdeenshire next week.The informal drop-in sessions will give people the chance to find out more about Live Le Aberdeenshire’s plans for developing libraries, and the opportunity to share their opinions and ideas about future services.An online survey seeking views on future library provision runs until the end of the month and has already attracted more than , responses.The open sessions in communities are intended to complement this survey, seeking the opinions of those who use – or don’t yet use – their local library.Knowledgeable staff will be on hand in each venue to talk through planned changes and improvements, with a wealth of information about the ways in which libraries fit into community le at the moment.Modern libraries aim to be at the heart of their community - a safe and neutral space to browse, learn and meet people.Take this opportunity to shape your local library service over a cup of tea and a chat.Public engagement events:Ellon Library: Tuesday, February  - am to pm.Inverurie Library: Thursday, February  - am to pm.Kemnay Community Cafe, Kemnay Hall: Friday, February  - .am to .am.Kintore Library: Monday, February  - .pm to pm.Meldrum Library: Tuesday, February  - pm to pm.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Thainstone House Hotel\"  Award success for hotel viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Take part in the online survey before it closes on February  here."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie auctioneer join iaas","story":"An auctioneer from Inverurie has been welcomed to the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in Scotland .Ellis Mutch is one of six Scottish students in year three of the Livestock Market Operations and Management course at Harper Adams University in Shropshire and was presented with his associate membership certicate by IAAS President Scott Donaldson.The certicate in higher education he is working towards is seen as the professional standard for entry into the livestock auctioneering sector.

Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, said: “Facebook may be happy to shut its eyes to abuse but it can’t close its ears to the unanimous concern shown by international experts.“Mark Zuckerberg has a choice whether to allow sexual abuse to soar on his sites or listen to those from all over the world asking him to rethink how to implement encryption without putting children at risk.”"},{"url":null,"title":"north east granite for new york building","story":"Three ornamental pillars crafted from Peterhead granite are making their way across the Atlantic for use in the restoration of a historic New York building after some detective work by Scottish stonemasons.Natural stone specialists Fyfe Glenrock were able to identy the type of granite required for the multi-million-dollar restoration of the Big Apple’s oldest apartment block from a photograph of the existing columns.The Oldmeldrum-based firm was contacted by counterparts in the States seeking a perfect match for three polished granite pillars at The Windermere, on the city’s upmarket Upper West Side.Original shipping and building records suggested that the stone for the pillars had been imported from Scotland, prompting Swenson Stone Consultants in New Hampshire to contact a firm with a worldwide reputation for granite quarrying and craftsmanship.Fyfe Glenrock commercial manager Richard Collinson said: “We have worked with this firm in the past so they were aware of our knowledge of Scottish granites and they emailed asking for confirmation of the identity of the granite used on the building which they believed to be from Aberdeenshire.“The photo they sent had sufficient detail for us to know that the pillars had been created from Peterhead granite. It’s always very interesting when we get an unusual request like this, and we’re delighted to be able to help restore a building of such signicant historical interest.”The building slowly fell into a state of decline and in  was declared unsafe by the fire department.Two years later it was bought by a developer and the major refurbishment will see the building reopen its doors as a plush hotel, with retail space and a number of private apartments.The pillars have been produced, polished and finished at Fyfe Glenrock’s base in Oldmeldrum and are now being shipped to the USA where, said Mr Collinson, they will not look out of place.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Respitality support worker Ann Brodie alongside colleagues from Energie Fitness\"  ‘Respitality’ links to support carers viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"stephen to hold 24 hour charity pt athon","story":"An Inverurie-based personal trainer is holding a -hour fitness event to raise funds for a charity which supported his sister.Stephen Hart, of Hart Fitness, will run fitness classes throughout the day and night on Saturday, February  in aid of CLAN Cancer Support.The personal trainer was inspired to raise funds for CLAN after his sister, Lauren, turned to the charity for support following a breast cancer diagnosis.Lauren, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, accessed CLAN’s services in Inverurie including counselling and wellbeing therapies.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney. It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website. We’re very grateful to the STV Growth Fund and to LEADER for their assistance in bringing this campaign to fruition and also hope viewers enjoy seeing this snapshot of le in the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility. Since then, little progress has been made.“What has happened, however, is that the ferries operating these leline routes have got older, less reliable and more costly to run. Despite the best efforts of crews, we have seen increasing levels of disruption, including the ongoing problems with the MV Eynhallow. This situation is simply not sustainable and needs to be addressed.“Scottish Government needs to agree a clear timetable for taking forward the procurement of replacement vessels so that communities in Orkney have the leline services they deserve. I will be following this up with the Minister.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.” Responding to the murders of at least nine people in Hanau, Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were clear signs that the killer had been motivated by racism.Merkel, of the centre-right CDU party, has been described by some as the new ‘leader of the free world’ because of her strong stance against the sinister ideology espoused by those such as the far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Echoing Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he has declared “the age of liberal democracy is at an end” on the grounds that it is no longer able to “provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture”. Normally the US President is the unofficial leader of the free world, but Donald Trump, quite accurately, views Orban as “probably like me”.: Andrew Sabisky: what the former No.  adviser is alleged to have said about pregnancies, eugenics and race as he steps down: Boris Johnson is not a ‘real racist’ despite Brits criticism, says Home Secretary Priti PatelFor Orban, the Christian culture of Europe is under threat from “Muslim invaders” and there is, and always will be, a great iding line between these two religions. He is right about one thing, but wrong about everything .There is indeed a iding line that separates human beings, not just in Europe, but all over the world. On one side of this line are groups like Isis but also far-right killers such as one in Hanau another who massacred  people in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year and the man who killed  people in attacks in Oslo and the island of Utoya in Norway in .The fascists may view the ‘Islamofascists’ as their deadly enemies, but they are fundamentally the same. Disagree with them too much and they will kill you belong to the wrong group and they will kill you.On the other side are the vast majority of people – of all religions and none – who are decent, peace-loving and respectful of others’ basic right to exist.Racism and other forms of bigotry are ideological mechanisms, societal poisons, that can persuade people to cross this line into a le of violence, murder and death.So , on playing a word association game, you say “terrorist” on hearing “Muslim”, beware, because you are heading in a dangerous direction.The basic premise of liberalism – the prevailing philosophy of all true democracies – is that each and every one of us is an inidual. It is, therefore, the antidote to the poison of prejudice.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how to stay rational about coronavirus in the face of panic dr antonis kousoulis","story":"The Covid- coronavirus outbreak may feel scary to some, but it is important to retain a sense of perspective and seek out reputable sources of information, writes Dr Antonis Kousoulis.The UK is a bit on edge at the moment. Following hot on the heels of Brexit, we’ve seen weather challenges, and a news agenda dominated by the Covid- coronavirus outbreak. It’s fair to say public health and climate related emergencies are only likely to become more frequent in the next few years, as environmental and human challenges become more pressing.In the case of the coronavirus, we don’t know yet what will happen.The very best scientists in the world are studying the virus and its impact, and responding appropriately with containment, treatment and advice. We don’t know what that will mean for the UK and the wider world - how the disease will develop, whether it will spread and what the implications will be for our ability to stay healthy, to work, to visit people and to move around freely.Uncertainty breeds concern – and several mental health helplines are getting calls about the virus. We worry about change, and about things we can’t control. There is a lot of information and advice out there, some good, and some bad. It is changing all the time, and there is a lot of fake news around. Even health organisations have often taken a very top-down approach with patronising messaging about what people should or should not be doing, instead of properly engaging with the communities that are facing the real stresses.: Man from Heriot Watt University tests negative for coronavirus after advice sent out to students: A coronavirus hoax message is circulating on WhatsApp - here’s what to doyou receive itThe situation may feel scary but panic and stress can cloud our judgement and lead to bad decisions for our health. There are things that you can do to stay mentally healthy.We need to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak. Rumour and speculation fuel anxiety. Some diseases, such as bird-flu, did not develop at all. And not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Having access to good quality and up-to-date information about the virus can help us feel more in control. You can get up-to-date information and advice on the virus from the NHS, Gov.uk, Health Protection Scotland and Public Health Wales.Find a balanceWe should all be following hygiene advice such as washing hands often, particularly after using public transport or after being in public places, using tissuesyou sneeze or cough and disposing of them, and staying at homeyou are feeling unwell.Not everything you see or hear is going to be true. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it’s important to find a balance. It’s best that you don’t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intakeit is bothering you. You might want to mute or turn off news notications or your smartphone or limit your news intake to once a day.At times of stress, we usually work better in company and with support. It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we consume news about the outbreak, especiallywe have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health, and avoid increasing habits that are not helpful, like smoking and drinking.Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. You may also like to focus on the things you can doyou feel able to: use stress management and relaxation techniques, keep active and eat a balanced diet.Rumours at schoolOur response to infectious outbreaks, like in mental ill-health, has a history of discriminating against the most vulnerable. It’s really important not to judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. Being caring and supportive improves the chances of prevention and recovery.Talk to your children and your family and reassure anyone you know who is worried. Involving family and children in plans for mental health is essential. We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. They could have picked up rumours at school. Don’t avoid the “scary topic” but engage in a way that is understandable to them. We have more advice on talking with your children about world news.All around the world, there are epidemiologists and public health doctors whose job it is to look out for patterns in disease. But as the news cycle has become -hour, and our connection to distant world events more and more immediate, there is a very real risk that real, but small threats become hyper magnied in our minds before we have the chance to work out how concerned we should actually be.The critical thing for our mental health is that we gain appropriate perspective and context – without cutting ourselves off from important public health advice.It may be that the coronavirus outbreak burns out. It may join the other four human coronaviruses as a condition which appears and disappears from time to time – or it may become a global threat to public health. Whether it is this agent, or another, there will come a time when we need to be able to receive and respond to urgent public health advice. That includes making sure that we are in our best mental health to be able to act rationally when required.Dr Antonis Kousoulis is a director at the Mental Health Foundation, a medical doctor specialist in public health and a visiting lecturer at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first pictures of the batman emerge as filming of scottish scenes begins","story":"The production comes to the Scottish city for the new Warner Bros and DC Comics movie being released next year, with road closures in place until Sunday.window.twttr : The Scottish influence behind the creation of BatmanCrews were set up around the Necropolis cemetery near Glasgow Cathedral and Glasgow Royal Infirmary - with someone in the famous suit riding a motorcycle.However, it is thought to be a stuntman seen on Friday afternoon rather than Twilight star Robert Pattinson, who will portray the dual role of Bruce Wayne and the Batman.As rehearsals progressed, the costumed man could be seen wiping the rain away from his goggles as the city thought to be doubling up as Gotham was hit with a yellow weather warning on Friday.Blockbuster cityIt comes a week after director Matt Reeves shared a first look at the suit in a tweet with the hashtag #CameraTest.The filming in Glasgow will see a number of roads closed including Wishart Street, Ladywell Street, Cathedral Square, Drygate and John Knox Street.Diversions are in place around Castle Street, High Street, Duke Street and Alexandra Parade.The cathedral was also used recently to film scenes for Netflix-sequel The Princess Switch: Switched Again starring Vanessa Hudgens.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce. Mrs Tymelly, played by Bereen who first had the role in the Lyric in , isof everyone’s secrets as well as one of her own.The actress is no stranger to London, but much has changed since she first travelled there: “I worked in London in the s as a nurse – I did midwery in Beckenham Maternity Hospital, a good bit south of the centre. Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le. Organisations like CALM are the best defence we have against stories that end like Joe’s.”CALM runs a free and confidential helpline and webchat for anyone who needs to talk about le’s problems, available in NI and across the UK.‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ runs until February .Stage set forof one-woman Ruby show Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"pipe band championships to be held in antrim","story":"Around , visitors are expected to attend the second Antrim and Newtownabbey Regional Pipe Band Championship event at Antrim Castle Gardens in June.The event is being organised by the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association of Northern Ireland .The borough council will host the event at a cost of £,.Traditionally, this competition is held on the third Saturday in July but it has been switched this year to avoid a clash with the annual Antrim Agricultural Show in Shanes Castle.The organisers turned down the opportunity of holding the event at V at The Valley, in Newtownabbey.Meanwhile, a craft event is to be moved to an indoor location following concerns over weather and a subsequent reduction in visitor numbers.Mossley Mill has been recommended as the venue for ‘Spinning Yarns’ this September at a cost of £,.The event was held at Antrim Castle Gardens for the past two years and is said by council officers to be “challenged by poor weather”.Although this is described as “an ever present risk year round for any outdoor event but particularly challenging for the audience profile for this specialist event”.Council officers have stated that the numbers “reduced signicantly” to , last year, from , in , which they have acknowledged was “disappointing”.“There is no doubt the poor weather and warning issued impacted upon this.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day.

But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in .

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs feasibility study into future of belfast zoo","story":"Belfast Zoo. Picture: Google Maps  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBelfast Zoo. Picture: Google Maps Eimear McGovernFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAll Belfast City Council parties apart from Sinn Fein have backed an amendment supporting Belfast Zoo and the long-term sustainability of the attraction. Councillors have agreed to undertake a feasibility study to assess the future of the zoo, its staff and future investment. It#s after Sinn Fein brought a motion earlier this month calling for the transformation of the facility into a world-class visitor attraction by , with animals ed to their natural habitats in a carefully crafted phased approach. A conservation programme for indigenous animals was to be maintained and the council commit to retaining staff.The party later criticised reaction to the motion after widespread outcry on social media, saying it was never their intention to close the zoo. On Friday, councillors attended a Strategic Policy and Resources Committee, where the original motion was amended. The motion amended by Alliance councillor Nuala McAllister now reads: This Council reaffirms its support for Belfast Zoo and its staff and its long-term sustainability and future investment. The Council agrees to scope future investment and a feasibility study for the long-term sustainability of Belfast Zoo and the surrounding area, including Floral Hall. This will be done in conjunction with leading experts, key stakeholders and public consultation and engagement.Ms McAllister said the amendment reaffirms the commitment Belfast City Council has for Belfast Zoo.She said the council will seek to invest in and upgrade the facilities with the advice of experts in zoos and tourism. We should not be simply looking to downsize or relocate animals, as some have suggested, as experts have outlined how it is a high-risk approach.Sinn Fein councillor Conor Maskey said his party believes the amendment takes away the impetus of their original motion. Our argument is that it#s not ambitious enough, he said. We want to make the public confident we#re not trying to do away with the zoo but we don#t want to make the same mistakes we#ve always made. We#re going to work with the other parties and engage with them. A process is going to start but lets not get to a stage where nothing happens and we#re back here in five years time, he said. The motion will be debated at a meeting of Belfast City Council on March . We#re very far away from the impetus we want. We#re keeping that site open, the question is what we#re keeping it open exactly for.Ms McAllister said the intention is for Belfast Zoo to be a crowning glory for the city. “Staff at the zoo are highly valued, with many dedicating their lives to education and conservation. I urge those seeking to close or otherwise reduce the zoo to listen to these people and the great work they do, so they can see for themselves it is not just there for entertainment purposes.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadFarewell to a hero: Harry Gregg funeral told of legend#s courage and ability as Manchester United greats join mournersFriends tell of heartbreak after Co Antrim crash kills two young livesHow to find out which foot you kick with: Ulster Museum exhibition takes on Northern Ireland stereotypes Ex-councillor Sorcha McAnespy calls in police over social media smears Harry Gregg funeral to bring Coleraine to standstill as football world jets in to remember hero of Munich,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Both boxers, known for their expansive sense of humour, recreated a scene from the original  film, engaging in a walking stick battle, much to the bemusement of their respective opponents on Friday night. The duo have been known to bring a sense of good fun with them wherever they go, and with both hoping to upset the odds to win a two year contract worth five fights and six figures, it seems the perfect way to decompress with the pressure now on.McCullagh easily saw off the challenge of Sheffields Razaq Najib at York Hall back in October, enjoying a unanimous decision victory, a performance which, in itself, was a strike back at the disrespect he felt aimed his way by former World Cruiserweight champion Jonny Nelson. The skilful WBO European super bantamweight champion was the first man to make it into the last four of the lucrative competition which earns the winner a six figure deal and he is expecting to go one step further at least, evenhe must take on arguably his toughest opponent to date in Walsh.“It was just a laugh,” he said afterwards.“These press conferences can get a bit serious and it was just something dferent to mix it up a bit. Were a bit like the real le Dumb and Dumber, me and McKenna, because were always missing flights and stuff like that, so we just did it for a bit of craic. I have the same colour hair as Lloyd so I got Lloyd Christmas and he got Harry, so that was it. “Some people took it more seriously than we did, but you cant be too serious. Theres plenty of time after the weigh in or when you are walking to the ring, I can flip the switch then, but up until then its a laugh and you have to enjoy yourself. How long are you going to be in these positions, doing press conferences on Sky Sports, so enjoy it and make the most of it.” googletag.cmd.push ChallengingThe format of this competition is challenging for each participant with the draw taking place on Tuesday when a golden ball was added into the pot with the fighter selecting it able to choose their opponent from the three remaining fighters that selected the red balls. Walsh picked McCullagh, but regardless, each fighter has only three days notice. “I could see why people would choose me,” McCullagh stated. “I have  fights, Walsh and Wood look very impressive and Jazza looked impressive in his own way in his quarterfinal, so I could see why people might have chosen me.  PICTURED:Tyrone McCullagh is just two steps away from a two-year Golden Contract with MTK Global. googletag.cmd.push “But at the same time everyone knows Im a bit of a nightmare, and awkward and dficult to box so I wasnt sure how the picking would have went. “I was happy to get picked. I dont knowother people are lying but I really didnt want that gold ball.”As dficult as this fight will be for McCullagh, it will be as equally as challenging for Walsh, with the Derry man known for his dficult style.“Paddy Barnes always jokes that I bamboozle opponents and people always say Im a nightmare to spar but no-one is unbeatable and I do make mistakes,” McCullagh explained. “Its been so far, so good and hopefully come Friday night I still will be. “Ryan Walsh is a great champion and he is favourite for the tournament for a reason. He is a great, great fighter with a lot of great results. I know Im in for a tough nights work. No one is unbeatable and I believe thatI box to the best of my ability, I can beat him.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When boarding a Dublin bus in Dundrum, my constituent was refused entry to the bus and told that his pass was invalid, which of course is not the case. Obviously, this was a source of frustration and embarrassment, and would in many cases discourage a potential traveller from using the SmartPass.The MLA added: I have written to the Minister for Infrastructure to request that the notice that these passes are eligible in all  counties is made explicit on the pass, and also that there is greater tie in with bus operators in the  counties to ensure that drivers are trained correctly and made aware of the eligibility of these passes.I will be raising this issue with our infrastructure spokespeople in the assembly and in the Dail to ensure that a meeting is requested with the bus operators in the  counties, who should be training their staff properly about which passes are valid for use.The dark days of cross-border travel being an issue are thankfully well behind us. Obviously, Brexit threatens this again, and it is in the interest of all elected reps to ensure that free movement across Ireland remains a norm. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its such a wonderful cause and Lucy really opened my eyes to it.I was nervous when it came to getting it cut, but she couldnt wait and she was all smiles.I took some photos of her getting it done and didnt realise until after that shes winking in one of them.Lucy raised pound through an online sponsorship and the rest was donated by family and friends.Its a great charity and its lovely that Lucy will be helping other children, continued Ms Cruickshank.Its nice to raise awareness that the charity is out there and maybe other girls will want to do the same thing.Id also like to thank Selena Doherty McFeely, of Syenna Hair and Beauty in Pump Street, where she got it cut and Dearbhla Lynch, the hairdresser who cut it for her. googletag.cmd.pushIf you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The children and young people have explored what it feels like to grow up in Derry City and Strabane, talking about things like places to play, meeting friends, being healthy and feeling safe.The information collected during the discovery phase will be used to shape the two-three year action plan to make the vision of a Child Friendly Community a reality.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, attended the event and thanked the young people in attendance for their useful and honest contribution.“Child Friendly Communities aim to create cities and communities where all children have a meaningful say in and truly benefit from the local decisions, services and spaces that shape their lives,” she explained.“With expert training and guidance from Unicef UK, the partnership sees politicians, staff and volunteers turning to children’s rights – as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child – to guide decisions that affect children and young people.“Ongoing work has been taking place at a local level and a range of youth and adult stakeholders have already been involved in remote consultation.”Concluding, the Mayor said:“This event allowed children and young people to have an input into the decisions that affect them – from major policies, to decisions around the care they receive.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Gallaghers side have had a weeks break after getting their first win, but they are still playing catch up after a draw against Leitrim and a defeat against fellow promotion chasers Down. They sit on score dference above Down and Tipp but rather than look whats on their shoulder, the Oakleafers are looking up, at both Longford and Cork.Despite not hitting the heights as yet, Derry are favourites to make it two victories in a row against a Louth side who sit bottom of the table with three defeats from three. Victory is essential for Gallagher and his players, with a second successive promotion still very much the aim.The Oakleafers will again look to Shane McGuigan for inspiration this weekend, the Slaughtneil man really finding his form of late, scoring - against Tipperary and Down combined. McGuigan will be the main danger for Louth who are still hoping to get off the mark, but with Derrys need arguably greater, the two points should stay at Owenbeg. This will be the penultimate game on home soil with dficult trips to Cork and Offaly sandwiching a huge game at home against Longford.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

It is now just one win in five league games for Derry who remain at second bottom in Division C. The - defeat to Bangor at the weekend, amidst horrible conditions, was the last thing that Derry needed, the only game in the ision to go ahead on a grass surface.“It wasnt really our day but the conditions were the same for both teams so we cant really use it as an excuse,” coach Richard Mccarter said. “It probably suited Bangor better than us because they had a big, heavy strong pack and their game plan was pretty obvious from the word go, but we just couldnt live with them. The fact that they had the upper hand in the scrum made things dficult for us but I just dont think we helped ourselves. “Having said that we still created enough chances in the second half that we could have got the draw at least or even sneaked the win but our decision making and lack of accuracy really mattered in the final third and let us down. Overall, it was a really disappointing performance and result and we just need a reaction this weekend.”Despite the defeat, there are still just six points between ninth place and fourth, but McCarter is realistic enough to admit that getting off second bottom is the only concern at present.“Up until Saturday we were really positive in terms of looking up the table and still thinking we could make top four,” he continued. “I think now we just need to recognise that first and foremost we need to get off second bottom. “We still feel thatwe could put a run of form together that we could go up the table, but the reality is that we havent been able to put a run together. We need to start somewhere and it needs to start this weekend and then well reassess after that but our priority is to get away from Midleton and then get to that play-off spot as well.”Tullamore come to Derry with promotion hopes of their own and will be hoping to replicate the win they enjoyed over Paul OKanes side back in November. They face a Derry side on the ropes at present, and McCarter admits that the stature of their opponent does not matter at all at this stage, with the hosts needing to dig themselves out of trouble regardless.“Whether they are first, third or bottom it wont make a dference to our approach this week,” he insisted.“We know its going to be a very tough game. They play a similar style of rugby to Bangor where its very forward orientated so we have got to be better prepared for that than we were on Saturday. Conditions are likely going to be tough again this week because I dont think the forecast is great but we just have got to adapt better. “We have got ways and means of doing it – we still have good strong ball carriers in the pack, we have good strong backs as well, but with our attitude this week, I think we really have to show that we want it, andwe create chances, which we likely will, we have got to take them. We cant miss the chances we have over the last few weeks because they really have proven costly.”Prop Sam Duffy, who missed last weeks defeat to Bangor, is likely to miss out again this weekend. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose.

Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar community facility unused over power supply issue  ","story":"A COMMUNITY centre in Ballykinlar is lying unused because it has no electricity supply, it emerged this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE and the MoD to address the power supply on as soon as possible.Last night the Ministry of Defence indicated that it had been working with NIE Networks and ldquoawaited confirmation of the proposed works.A spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks on the installation of a power supply for the community centre.ldquoThe MOD has a long relationship with the

Down Cathedral on Sunday afternoon, the Right Rev David McClay said Jesus Christ died on the cross for everyone and that the Church had a responsibility to teach the world of God.ldquoWe are charged to take His message out into the world, to our towns, villages, townlands and beyond, he said. ldquoWe have a responsibility to teach Godrsquos word to those who are not here today.The service was attended by clergy and lay readers from throughout the Down and Dromore diocese.Also in attendance were clergy from other denominations, including Fr John Murray, Downpatrick parish priest, and Canon Sean Rogan, a former parish priest in the town.Also present were the Rev Dr Heather Morris, a former president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and Abbot Mark-Ephraim and Fr Eric from the Benedictine Holy Cross Abbey in Rostrevor.Among the dignitaries were the Lord Lieutenant for Co Down, Mr David Lindsay,Baroness Margaret Ritchie, Strangford MP Jim Shannon, MLAs Colin McGrath and

Just  people posted comments in relation to the graffiti incident.Police suspect that the graffiti incidents took place late last Friday evening or in the early hours of Saturday and are keen for anyone who can help with their investigations to come forward.Both incidents have sparked a sharp rebuke from South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Willie Clarke.Mr McGrath said there was no place for what he described as ldquohateful graffiti in society, lsquolet alone a gable wall overlooking a graveyardrsquo.He remarked: ldquoThis is an act of vandalism and is completely unacceptable. I utterly condemn those behind this. They should be ashamed of their actions.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThose responsible do not represent the people of South Down and these actions will not be tolerated.Cllr Clarke said many people have been left ldquodisgusted at the incident.He said no one in Newcastle will condone what happened and that it was ldquoparticularly disturbing that graffiti was painted on a gable wall of a pensionerrsquos home next to a graveyard.Cllr Clarke said graveyards are sacrosanct, places where people go to pay their respects to loved ones. He said visitors attended the graves of loved ones should not have to look at graffiti.He declared: ldquoI believe that both graffiti incidents are linked and would appeal to anyone who has any information to come forward to assist police with their enquiries.ldquoI have spoken to the owner of the house at the Downs Road and she is understandably annoyed at what happened. I suspect those who responsible forthe graffiti incidents were either high or alcohol or drugs or a combination of both.ldquoNo one wants to see anything like this in Newcastle or indeed any other town or village across the district.

With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out. They have been behind us the entire way.Shane believes that he and Connor, whorsquos originally from South Devon, were meant for each other.ldquoFor me, it was definitely love at first sight. Once we got together, we became inseparable, said Shane, whorsquos a support worker for Autism Initiatives in Newcastle.ldquoI just loved Connorrsquos personality and how caring he was as a person and how he would do anything for anyone. Of course, hersquos also beautul.For Connor, who works in a Newcastle cafeacute, said he was drawn to Shanersquos ldquoopen, honest face and knew right away he was ldquoa good guy.When the two young men decided to commit to one another, they initially believed that it would be a civil partnership ceremony.Same-sex marriage was only made legal in Northern Ireland mdash in line with the rest of the UK mdash on January  as it was voted in by MPs in the House of Commons last autumn. Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple. Itrsquos a really big thing and part of Northern Irelandrsquos history so we feel privileged to be a part of it.The couple intend to make Co Down their home in the future and see themselves as parents.Shane said: ldquoWe would love to have children, whether thatrsquos by using a surrogate or by adopting, but itrsquos definitely one of the big things in our future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Storm.jpg","title":"Storm sewage deluge  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Ballynahinch have appealed for an end to what they have described as a ldquoflooding nightmare at the busy Lisburn Street junction with Main Street in the town.Persistent heavy rain swept in by Storm Dennis last Saturday left the busy Ballynahinch junction under water with traders forced to take precautions to protect their property.Storm water and raw sewage flow into a combined drain which struggles to cope when there is heavy rain, with speculation locally that a section of underground piping is blocked.Matt Comiskey, of Jordyrsquos Bar, said sewage was evident during last Saturdayrsquos deluge and revealed that while the issue has been raised with NI Water on a number of occasions, no affirmative action has been taken.He has been informed that work to address the issue will result in a section of Lisburn Street having to be dug up. He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

The very fact that Emily Thornberry publicly supported us for the first time in response to our canvass shows this is nonsense.Our lobbying over the years has won widespread support for our case among MPs, CLPs and trade unions, who increasingly recognise we are being disgracefully discriminated against.If we decide to back up our lobbying with legal action we would seem to have adequate grounds.The Labour Party is in breach of contract with its membershere in that it takes our subscription money and our political levies, but denies us electoral representation.Also, under the Race RelationsOrder , it would appear that by suppressing Labour candidates here, the party is ‘institutionally discriminating’against not just its members here but against the entire Northern Ireland electorate.Boyd Black, Secretary, Labour Party in Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"reopening events showcase carrickfergus castles psm renovations ","story":"Causeway Coast and Glens: Independent says councillors should take % pay cutPlan to develop  new homes would close urban gap on outskirts of BallymenaNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsReopening events to showcase Carrickfergus Castle’s £m renovationsA £m restoration project at Carrickfergus Castle will be unveiled to visitors at the end of this month.By The NewsroomTuesday, th February , : pm\"\"Work to replace the roof of the Great Tower was part of the overall project.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
