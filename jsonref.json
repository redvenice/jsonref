Then, to the surprise of friends, in 2009 he married Rose Hanbury, a willowy ex-model, 23 years his junior.They had met at a party at the Villa Cetinale, the grand Italian home of the disgraced Tory peer Lord Lambton — Rose’s sister, Marina, is married to Lambton’s heir Ned, the Earl of Durham.         In 2014 William and Kate decided to move full time to Anmer Hall, the country house close to Sandringham that was given to them by the QueenThe comely sisters, who were once pictured in swimsuits with former prime minister Tony Blair have an impeccable pedigree. Their grandmother was Lady Elizabeth Longman, a bridesmaid at the Queen’s wedding to Prince Philip.The Cholmondeleys’ home is Houghton Hall, a stunning Palladian mansion built in the 1720s for Britain’s first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. The 106-room pile is barely four miles from Anmer and it was soon being reported that the Cholmondeleys with their three children were part of the so-called ‘turnip toffs’, a set of well-born friends of William and Kate with North Norfolk homes.           Among their near neighbours was the Marquess of Cholmondeley, 58, who as Lord Great Chamberlain had a unique role at the State Opening of Parliament (pictured in 2007)— walking backwards in front of the QueenMembers were said to include William and Rosie van Cutsem, the Earl and Countess of Leicester, who live at Holkham Hall and James and Laura Meade, who is a godmother to Prince Louis.One weekend report said the Cholmondeleys’ twin sons, Alexander and Oliver, were playmates of Prince George, despite the four-year age gap between them.Rose and David were both guests (of the Queen) at William and Kate’s wedding in 2011, and three years ago the royal couple attended a black tie gala at Houghton Hall. Rose and Kate, meanwhile are patron and royal patron respectively of the charity East Anglia Children’s Hospices, and the Duchess has attended the Houghton Hall horse trials with her children.William and David would appear to have less in common. The marquess — French-speaking, piano-playing and a lover of modern art — is, after all, the same age as his late mother. The men have been shooting together, but this is normal among landowners in Norfolk.So does all that add up to a close friendship? According to an authoritative family source, the two couples have been to each other’s homes only three times.                William appears to have little in common with the marquess — French-speaking, piano-playing and a lover of modern art — who is, after all, the same age as his late mother. The men have been shooting together, but this is normal among landowners in Norfolk‘They see each other occasionally and like each other,’ a figure close to Rose tells me.‘They are not part of each other’s close circle. It isn’t even remotely a bosom-close friendship.’Nevertheless, tongues started wagging. Last week the Daily Mail did report in its diary gossip that there was competition between the duchess and the marchioness. But Saturday’s Sun newspaper reported that the ‘falling out’ was ‘much worse than first thought’.A source was quoted by the newspaper as saying: ‘They used to be close but that is not the case any more.’ It said William offered to make peace but added: ‘Kate has been clear that she doesn’t want to see them any more and wants William to phase them out, despite their social status.’At first, William and David laughed the rumours off — I am told they even reached the ears of the wider Royal Family. But the latest reporting has changed the atmosphere.I understand both men are baffled by the rumours and insist there is no rift between them or their wives.A family source told me: ‘These hurtful rumours of a fall-out are simply false. William and David were in touch with each other over the weekend, not knowing whether to laugh or complain. Both wives are hurt by the suggestion that there is any argument or even a coolness between them. They have plans for future events involving their charity.‘This is a question of a lie going round the world before the truth has even had time to take its boots off.’ Another family figure said: ‘A whisper which had no basis or truth has turned into a roar.                 William and Kate (pictured at the St Patrick\u0027s Day parade in Hounslow) have not been photographed exchanging so much as a cross word in public. Richard Kay understands that both William and the Marquess of Cholmondeley are baffled by the rumours and insist there is no rift between them or their wivesBoth couples laughed when it was first carelessly put around and endlessly repeated, even though it was patently not true. As more and more people passed it on, it took on a life of its own and has now become hurtful and toxic.’A family friend of Rose said: ‘It has now become very upsetting and they are all concerned for each other, as they have never before had to start denying something for which these is no evidence or even a smidgen of truth. It is just mad.‘David and Rose have been to Sandringham and shot with William and Kate, but they have been to each other’s houses fewer than three times each — some rift!’For William and Kate the developments are especially troubling. They have always been enormously careful about friendships and they have placed a premium on trust. They have eschewed the celebrity friends that Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex appear to like to surround themselves with.No friends of Kate have gone chatting to gossipy magazines as Meghan’s have done to People and Vanity Fair. As a royal wife and mother, Kate has never put a foot wrong, her family are loyal and discreet. She carries out her official duties with enthusiasm.She and William have not been photographed exchanging so much as a cross word in public. But while William has never indulged in the kind of ‘what Meghan wants, Meghan gets’ foot-stamping as Prince Harry is said to have done, he knows how important she is as a mother and a future queen.And if this whole sorry episode turns out to be some cack-handed attempt to dent Kate’s unshakeable standing with the public, it has almost certainly backfired.

This is making people sceptical of the election results,\u0027 said party spokeswoman Pannika Wanich.\u0027The Election Commission should address this issue because if the people feel they cannot trust the results, there will be more problems to come,\u0027 she said.          Phalang Pracharat party leader Uttama Savanayana (centre) speaks during a press conference at the party headquarters in Bangkok on SundayThe country is likely to face several weeks of bargaining among political parties before a potentially unstable coalition government is formed in May or June.Thais voted for a 500-member parliament, which along with a 250-member junta-appointed Senate will decide the next prime minister. Future Forward, which was anti-junta and popular with young voters, scooped up 5.2million votes.But voters deserted the Democrat Party, the country\u0027s oldest political party, in its Bangkok and southern strongholds.Its leader, former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, resigned. Another party, Phumjai Thai, which experts say could support the junta, picked up 3.2 million votes.\u0027It looks unlikely that a sizeable enough anti-junta majority will form in the House to put pressure on the military to back away,\u0027 said Peter Mumford, an analyst at Eurasia Group, which advises international companies on political risks.

The Walker Brothers were at one time as big as The Beatles, greeted by screaming fans everywhere they wentWalker released the successful solo albums Scott, Scott 2 and Scott 3, and was given his own BBC TV series in 1969. At the same time, he began to incorporate darker songs into his repertoire of ballads, Broadway hits and original compositions.He recorded several songs by the brooding Belgian singer Jacques Brel and even studied Gregorian chant at a monastery on the Isle of Wight. When his album Scott 4 – for which he wrote all the songs – failed to chart, Walker consoled himself with drink and fell into depression.‘I snapped,’ he said years later. ‘The pressure was everywhere and, in my crazy imagination, I thought, “I’d better keep doing this just to stay in the game”.’Several more unsuccessful solo records marked what he would later call his ‘lost years’.In 1975, The Walker Brothers reunited but achieved only one chart success, No Regrets, and disbanded again in 1978.It would be six years before the world heard any new music from Scott Walker. When it finally arrived, on his album Climate Of Hunter, many were shocked.Not surprisingly, perhaps, as he had insisted on keeping the melody of each song a secret from the musicians so as to preserve their intensity.Music critics loved it, but it was said to have been record label Virgin’s lowest-selling album ever.         Walker\u0027s death in London at the age of 76 was announced yesterday and tributes flooded in for the starWalker then studied fine art and a further 11 years would pass until his next album.‘A friend of mine says I’m not a recluse, I’m just low-key,’ he once said in an interview. ‘Generally if I’ve got nothing to say, it’s pointless to be around.’When he did have something to say again, it was on the bleak, avant-garde album Tilt in 1995. With its ruminations on love, sex and death, it set the tone for Walker’s subsequent releases.His 2006 album The Drift included a song – featuring that unusual pork percussion – based on the execution by Italian partisans of the dictator Benito Mussolini, when the fascist leader’s mistress Claretta Petacci insisted on dying with him.By then Walker was artistically a million miles from the tousle-haired chart-topping crooner of his youth.‘I have long since stopped worrying about fitting in, in any way. I’m an outsider, for sure. That suits me fine. Solitude is like a drug for me. I crave it,’ he said in one of his rare interviews.In 2017, Walker’s music was celebrated with a Proms concert at London’s Royal Albert Hall. Last year, he wrote and produced the score for the film Vox Lux, starring Natalie Portman and Jude Law.Another recent project saw him compose music for dance company BalletBoyz, whose programme Fourteen Days was performed at Sadler’s Wells. Yesterday his current record label 4AD confirmed that Walker, who had been living in west London, died on Friday from cancer.In a statement, the company said: ‘Scott Walker has been a unique and challenging titan at the forefront of British music.‘Audacious and questioning, he has produced works that dare to explore human vulnerability and the godless darkness encircling it...‘From teen idol to cultural icon, Scott leaves to future generations a legacy of extraordinary music.’Walker is survived by his daughter Lee, from his marriage to Mette Teglbjaerg, his granddaughter Emmi-Lee and his partner Beverly.He is also survived by former bandmate Leeds, now 77.

Photograph: Christy Riordan The chief executive of a major New York construction company has hit out at the influence of holiday homeowners in the planning process in rural Ireland, saying environmental objectors are getting “to dictate” the needs of communities.There is growing anger in south Kerry that plans for a revamp of the landmark Cable O’Leary’s bar and hotel, the only facility in the village overlooking Ballinskelligs Bay, have been blocked after a number of objections, primarily from some of the roughly 300 holiday homeowners in the area.Amid continuing decline in population, just 50 houses are now occupied on a permanent basis in what is the heart of the south Kerry Gaeltacht.A packed meeting in Ballinskelligs at the weekend called on Kerry TDs to table a private members’ bill to ensure that economic and social needs of communities are factored into future planning decisions.Planning was focused only on architectural and environmental issues, local people complained at the meeting.The transatlantic era Cable O’Leary’s , the only bar or restaurant in the village will now close entirely, Kevin O’Sullivan, the president and chief executive of Tower Holdings, said in a letter read to the meeting.Mr O’Sullivan said the building was unsafe and subsiding and negotiations aimed at bringing on board a hotel operator had now fallen through. The application for redeveloping the building had been made by OS Properties, part of the Tower Holdings group which has offices in New York and Cork.As a native Kerryman “this development was always more than a business investment”, he said, expressing profound disappointment at the decision. His 90-year-old mother and relatives were in the audience.The character of the old cable station would have been incorporated into the design and the size was reduced in line with a request by Kerry County Council. The additional studies and demands had cost the company more than €225,000, Mr O’Sullivan revealed.‘Local support’“With the amount of local support and backing this development has received, it is very unfortunate that people who own vacation properties in the area, whose livelihood is not impacted by, nor dependent on the local economy, and who do not contribute to its growth at the same scale as the permanent residents get to dictate what the true local community needs and deserves,” Mr O’Sullivan said.He shared the local community’s “disappointment over remote parties preserving their interest at the detriment of the immediate local community” .The old building was subsiding and created safety and fire hazards and “regretfully Cable O’Leary’s will be forced to close its doors”, he added.Mr O’Sullivan’s property interests include the Port of Cork site which he bought for a reported €5 million with his brother, Donal, in 2017 and is developing under plans for a €250 million office and hotel complex.Kerry County Council had given the go-ahead in July to demolish the 12-bedroom Cable O’Leary’s and replace it with a three-storey complex with 48 bedrooms, a function room and gym, restaurant and bar, car and bus park.Out of characterThe plans were deemed excessive and out of character with the area by the planning board, in line with the planning inspector and the appeals from parties with permanent addresses in Cork and Kenmare who feared the advent of mass tourism, traffic disturbance and interference with walking and cycling activities and the status of the area as an international dark sky reserve.The local development and community group Coiste Forbartha na Sceilge supported the plan, however.“We desperately need this project,” Des Cronin, a spokesman for the group said.There were about 300 holiday homes in the area, many let on a short-term basis, but there was no accommodation for last-minute visitors who wanted to stay overnight and avoid driving to Cahersiveen or Waterville, he added.The Coiste said 95 per cent of observations during the planning process involved holiday homeowners or people retired to the area.Mr Cronin said that since the refusal, large numbers of holiday homeowners had expressed their dismay and a number attended the meeting at the weekend in a show of support.Labour party TD Alan Kelly had expressed his dismay and disgust that the project had been rejected and that he, as a holiday homeowner in the immediate vicinity of the hotel site, would welcome its development, Mr Cronin added.After a call by local Fianna Fáil councillor Norma Moriarty, Kerry TDs are being asked to put down a private members’ bill to change planning legislation to prioritise local concerns."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3838208.1553548194!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"route of new shortened metrolink line to be revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFollowing pressure from politicians including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, Link will stop at Charlemont to avoid disruption of the Green line. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe new route of Dublin’s Link rail line will be revealed on Tuesday following the decision to scrap the controversial southside section of the line.The  last month reported that the line, which had been due to run from Swords to Sandyford, would terminate at Charlemont where it meets the Luas Green line. The National Transport Authority (NTA) is expected to confirm that decision.It is understood that plans to demolish the College Gate apartment block and Markievicz leisure centre on Townsend Street to facilitate the metro have not been reversed.Last March, the NTA announced plans for the line which would connect Dublin Airport to the city by rail, with the construction of new track from Swords to Charlemont, and an upgrade of the Luas Green line between Charlemont and Sandyford.However, following pressure from senior politicians, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, the route will stop at Charlemont to avoid disruption of the Green line.Minister for Transport Shane Ross last month said he would “not countenance” significant disruption to the Luas line and any plan which “requires an unacceptable level of shutdowns” to the Luas service would “not be tolerated”.Underground stationHowever, residents of the College Gate apartments, whose homes were last March earmarked for demolition to facilitate the construction of an underground station for the line, have been told this decision will not be changed.“The NTA told us they have looked at the alternatives but they don’t think there is enough reason to change,” resident Gordon Rose said. The Save College Gate campaign had proposed a number of adjacent sites, or different engineering solutions, that could be used as an alternative to demolishing their homes, Mr Rose said.“One of these solutions involved redirecting a sewer, but they don’t seem willing to consider even that.” Another proposal involved the demolition of a vacant office building he said.The route is being made available for another round of public consultation, and Mr Rose said residents would continue to fight for their homes. “This is just round two, we are not in any way going to give up. There are other viable options which can be pursued.”Home FarmThe new route will also see a station construction site in Glasnevin moved from lands owned by Na Fianna GAA club on St Mobhi Road to an adjacent training pitch belonging to Home Farm Football Club, following complaints by the GAA which were backed by Mr Varadkar.A tunnel boring machine, due to enter the ground at this site, will be moved to Ballymun. Earlier this month GAA club Ballymun Kickhams said they feared their plans for a new stadium in Ballymun would be jeopardised if the boring compound was moved to Ballymun. However, local Fine Gael TD Noel Rock said a resolution had been achieved which would see both the stadium and the metro works go ahead on separate parts of the site. “It’s a resolution I think everyone will be happy with, and I am happy to welcome.”Green Party leader Eamon Ryan had proposed that, as an alternative to running the metro from Charlemont to Sandyford along the existing Green line, it should instead serve other parts of the southside.He proposed two options: one to keep the line underground and run it from Charlemont to Rathmines, Terenure and Rathfarnham or to head east underground to UCD and then south on land reserved for the eastern bypass towards Sandyford. It is understood the NTA has dismissed both options."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute estimate haul of mature plants and harvested material worth \u0026euro40,000 journalist named for column on Trump, Brexit and the rise of the far-rightFF spokesman on climate action says party would support raising carbon taxes incrementallyWoman discovered on the floor of her room in Cork hospital with her child underneath herVote on funding follows controversial story into secretive society\u0026rsquos initiation ceremonyDedicated care teams could assess eyes and send public patients directly for fast surgerySecond wind farm company claims it has an agreement with landowner John HenryPlans to revamp landmark Cable O\u0026rsquoLeary\u0026rsquos bar in Ballinskelligs blocked after objectionsContingency planning taking place behind closed doors in event of no-deal BrexitThree junior ministers resign before defying whip to back amendment tabled by Tory Oliver LetwinSedentary activity contributes to almost 70,000 deaths in Britain annually, study findsGarda\u0026iacute are appealing for witnesses to a serious assault in Co TipperaryLate bishop admitted to one of the allegations, two other women given compensationPolice linking death of Tara Wright to car crash in early hours of Sunday morning\u0026lsquoCrops have been destroyed, which will lead to serious food shortages in the months ahead\u0026rsquoFormer Rose of Tralee launches election campaign as candidate in Co MayoGarda\u0026iacute handed Eric Eoin Marques (33) to the FBI after six year legal battleCollege Gate apartments to be demolished and Terenure direction proposal ditched"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3838180.1553541197!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit nears the dover cliff face mps should be burned at the stake","story":"Doug Cockle at the RAF Manston History Museum points out the window to the disused Manston Airport, which is being transformed into a park for up to 6,500 trucks. This is part of Operation Brock, a no-deal Brexit traffic management plan for Kent.If you drive alongside the airport’s fence you can see diggers and, every hundred yards or so, portacabins. “They had a practice run last month. But it was a joke. There were less than 100 lorries.”As a museum spokesman, he says, he can’t give me any views on Brexit, but he’s happy to tell me a joke: “What’s the difference between the mafia and the EU?”The punchline? “There’s no difference.”His fellow volunteers are more forthcoming about their views. “As far as I’m concerned the MPs should be taken out and burned at the stake,” says one man.A third volunteer, John White, thinks the Brexit process has been difficult only because “MPs aren’t used to making real decisions. The EU has been making the decisions for them.”He takes out a newspaper clipping from his pocket that, he says, encapsulates his views. It’s an opinion column from the Daily  headlined “Decisions affecting the lives of voters are taken by bureaucrats and unelected experts”.Does he know anyone who voted to remain? His son did, he says. “A lot of people voted remain because they’re worried about their jobs. But I’m an old man. Those things don’t matter to me.”Is he worried about Kent being turned into a truck park? He laughs. “I don’t go into work any more, so I can lie in bed and look out at it.”EU ‘dictatorship’Across the road at the Spitfire Memorial Museum, Jeremy Impett and Andrew Howell are a bit more disturbed at the thought of traffic chaos, but both of them voted to leave the EU. Why? “Immigration,” says Howell, “and how it’s driven down wages. I’m on a third of what I earned years ago.”“I’ve had periods of unemployment where I couldn’t find low-wage work,” says Impett.And the incursion of trucks isn’t too high a price? “No,” says Howell. “If the price of my house dropped underground and my wages got cut, I’d still choose to leave.” The EU, he says, “is a dictatorship”.“People wanted to upset the establishment,” says Impett. “And that’s why it’s been so hard to leave. The establishment wants us to stay in.”Some 62.2 per cent of people in the constituency of nearby Dover and Deal voted to leave the EU. Appropriately, there’s a Banksy mural near the ferry terminal in Dover town depicting a man on a ladder chiselling off one of the 12 stars on an EU flag.Over the course of a day in Dover, I meet only one remain supporter, Tunisian supermarket cashier Tariq Trad, and he couldn’t even vote in the referendum. He’s married to an English woman and has been in Dover five years. He thinks everyone is going to end up poorer if they leave.“People talk about it all the time, and the reason they all give is immigration,” he says. “That’s not a good reason. If there were five or six reasons that would be something – but just one? You could make it harder for people to come here without leaving the EU.”Immigration is not an issue for all Leave voters. “Some of the Poles are better workers than the English,” says Gary Robb. “I don’t care about immigration.”Robb is a long-time Labour supporter who, as a child, was on marches in support of the miners’ strikes. He once worked making surgical instruments, but now, he says, the UK doesn’t make things and it certainly doesn’t look after people. He was homeless for a while. His girlfriend, Carlie Jeffs, is deaf and uses a wheelchair. She tells me about disabled friends who aren’t getting the help they need. Brexit, says Robb, is their “stand”.Do they worry about what might happen if the UK leaves without a deal? “I think that’s a bit like the millennium bug,” says Robb. “It’s not going to be as much trouble as they say.”‘We’re a bit uneasy’Philosophy student Charlotte Rogers and economics student Brenden Kjellberg-Motton want to leave the EU because, says Rogers, “the European Union isn’t really democratic”.How do they feel it’s going? “We’re a bit uneasy,” says Kjellberg-Motton, “because it seems more and more likely they’ll push for a second referendum or revoke article 50.”They’d prefer leaving the EU with no deal to not leaving at all. They recognise that this might be “a bit chaotic” but they also believe it can be made to work.Today, in Kent, Highways England began trialling another element of Operation Brock. This is a contraflow system in which two lanes of the M20 are shut in preparation for a scenario in which thousands of trucks are delayed by customs checks. Few people I meet on the streets of Dover, however, believe such delays are really going to be a problem.Stephen, a Brexiteer who is happy to have his photo in this paper but won’t give his second name, insists lorries won’t be delayed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“Who’s going to stop them?” he asks.Customs officials, I say. “But we’re not stopping people going out, just people coming in,” he says. “And that will be France’s problem.”Stephen’s niece, Catherine, says she doesn’t have any views on Brexit. Why not? “I live in France,” she says. “I have dual nationality.”What does she do for a living? “I’m a childcare worker but I’m unemployed.”She didn’t vote in the EU referendum, but she does vote in France. Who will she vote for in the next election there? “Le Pen.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

A new design which could change the appearance of lorries, making them safer and more energy efficient, is expected to be approved by the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday.  Photograph: Gareth FullerPA Wire.A new design which could change the appearance of lorries, making them safer and more energy efficient, is expected to be approved by the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The aerodynamic design is aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and increasing visibility and includes more rounded, longer cabs which have space for drivers’ toilets and showers. But the plans have been given a tepid response from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association which let it be known that the vehicles may not be ready for introduction by the start date of September 2020. The design of lorries permitted on the EU’s roads is regulated by the commission, which has been steering the necessary legislation through the EU institutions for about seven years. The commission said measures now expected to be approved by the European Parliament “will considerably improve the aerodynamics of vehicles, saving approximately €5,000 per year in fuel costs for a typical long-distance lorry covering 100,000km”. EmissionsThis represents a 7-10per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions or 7.8 tonnes of CO2 for the same long-distance lorry covering 100,000 km. “At the same time, the field of vision of the driver would be improved and new safety devices like energy absorbers could be deployed, helping to save the lives of 300 to 500 vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or cyclists every year,” the commission said. The design represents a compromise between the regulators and the manufacturers with manufacturers reluctant to shorten the goods area of vehicles to accommodate the more aerodynamic approach. Under the compromise, manufacturers may make longer lorries if the additional length is in the cab area only. The next step is for manufacturers to receive “type-approval” from the EU for detailed specifications . But the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said: “The EU truck industry calls upon member states and the EU institutions to finalise these specifications as soon as possible.”James Nix, freight director at advocacy group Transport and Environment said “the next question is how soon manufacturers will take advantage of the EU’s new design blueprint. “The EU has rolled out the red carpet for the next generation of truck cabs. If European truckmakers don’t deliver them, then US and Asian manufacturers will. The race is on,” he said.

Photograph:  PA MPs at Westminster have voted to take control of Brexit away from Theresa May’s government by staging a series of votes on Wednesday on alternatives including customs union membership and a second referendum. Three junior ministers resigned on Monday night before defying the government whip to vote for the amendment tabled by Conservative Oliver Letwin, which was passed by 329 votes to 302.It will suspend the government’s parliamentary business from 2pm on Wednesday to allow MPs to debate and vote on a series of options for Brexit. Sir Oliver acknowledged that no option is likely to win a majority immediately and he suggested that the indicative votes would be the start of a process to find the version of Brexit that commands a majority.“One of the things we will all have to do is to seek compromise. If we all vote for that which is our first preference, I think we almost know that we will never get to a majority solution,” he said.Mrs May warned MPs that the amendment could create a dangerous precedent, adding that she could not guarantee that the government would implement any proposal that emerged from indicative votes.“No government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is. So I cannot commit the government to delivering the outcome of any votes held by this House. But I do commit to engaging constructively with this process,” she said.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer also declined to commit to accepting any recommendation that emerged from the process. He called the Government’s defeat over the Letwin amendment “humiliating”. Following the vote, Sir Keir tweeted: “Another humiliating defeat for a Prime Minister who has lost complete control of her party, her Cabinet and of the Brexit process. “Parliament has fought back - and now has the chance to decide what happens next.”Earlier, the prime minister told MPs that she did not have enough support to bring her Brexit deal back to the Commons for a third vote. DUP leader Arlene Foster told Mrs May during a phone call on Monday that her party could not support the deal despite the promise of legislation to ensure that the backstop would not lead to regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK without Stormont’s approval.Mrs May angered DUP MPs on Monday when she identified the absence of devolved institutions in Northern Ireland as one of the reasons why Britain could not leave the EU on March 29th. Nigel Dodds accused the prime minister of bringing up “an entirely new argument” when she had failed to prepare properly for a no-deal Brexit.ResignationsMrs May said she would continue to seek support for her deal, warning Brexiteers that a no-deal Brexit would not happen unless Parliament approves it. She said a more likely alternative to her deal was a “slow Brexit” that would delay Britain’s departure from the EU for months.Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay had urged MPs to vote down the Letwin amendment and related amendments. He said: “It’s the prime minister’s deal that is the way to deliver what the people voted for in 2016 and 2017.“That is why it’s right the government maintains control of the order paper in line with constitutional convention and why the amendments this evening should be defeated.” Maintaining the sense of crisis surrounding events in the Commons, business minister Richard Harrington had quit shortly before the vote to back the cross-party plan. Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt also resigned amid the key Brexit votes as did Health minister Steve Brine, a Government source said.Mrs May earlier told the House of Commons there was still not sufficient support among MPs to pass a third meaningful vote on her Brexit deal. Speaking on Monday afternoon, she said: “It is with great regret that I have to conclude that as things stand there is still not sufficient support in the House to bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote,” she said. “I continue to have discussions with colleagues across the House to build support so that we can bring the vote forward this week and guarantee Brexit.”The prime minister said the “default outcome” remained leaving the EU without a deal. “The alternative is to pursue a different form of Brexit or a second referendum,” she said.“But the bottom line remains: if the House does not approve the withdrawal agreement this week and is not prepared to countenance leaving without a deal, we would have to seek a longer extension.” That would mean holding European elections and would mean “we will not have been able to guarantee Brexit”.Mrs May also said the UK government had been looking at “alternative arrangements” to maintain an open Irish border in a no-deal Brexit but that further work was still required. She pointed out that the European Commission had made it clear in its statement on Monday on preparations for a possible no-deal scenario that “in all circumstances all EU laws would have to be abided by.”The prime minister was responding to a question from former Northern Ireland secretary of state Theresa Villiers who asked in the House of Commons about the remarks of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar saying that he was confident that some special arrangement could be found to keep an invisible border. ‘Minimal checks’Mrs May told DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds that the British government would ensure that there would be “minimal checks” at the Border for a temporary period but stressed that Brussels had made it clear that the EU law would be applied in all circumstances. Mr Dodds had questioned why the contentious “backstop” solution within the proposed EU-UK orce deal was necessary when Mr Varadkar had made it clear that in the event of a no-deal Brexit he was very confident there would be no checks along the Border. The Irish Government has said that without the proposed withdrawal agreement avoiding a hard border would be “more challenging” and would require details discussions between Ireland and the EU, and ultimately with the UK.The EU warned in the no-deal contingency planning note that it would be required “to immediately apply its rules and tariffs at its borders with the UK.”This would include checks and controls for customs, sanitary and phytosanitary standards covering animals, food of animal origin and plant health, and verification of compliance with EU norms. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, responding to Mrs May’s update to the Commons on Monday afternoon, said: “The Government’s approach to Brexit has now become a national embarrassment. “After two years of failure, broken promise after broken promise, the Prime Minister finally accepted the inevitable last week and voted to extend Article 50 and went to Brussels to negotiate.“Last week’s summit represented another negotiating failure for the Prime Minister - her proposals were rejected and new terms were imposed on her.”Shortly before Mrs May began addressing the Commons on Monday afternoon, the European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt tweeted: “Time is running out. A disastrous no-deal #Brexit is more likely than ever. It is now up to the UK Parliament to deliver a cross-party majority for a positive future EU-UK relationship. The door of the Europarl_EN remains open to a closer relationship.”‘Increasingly likely’In a statement earlier on Monday, the European Union said it believes a no-deal Brexit is “increasingly likely”.The news came after the EU gave Britain two more weeks to solve its political stalemate, although there is widespread doubt this will be achieved.“We are prepared for this scenario,” an EU official said describing contingency preparations. In its statement, the European Commission said it had completed its preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit, but warned it would nonetheless cause “significant disruption for citizens and businesses”. If it crashes out without a deal on April 12th, the UK will not benefit from a transition period to new arrangements, but will immediately be subject to checks and tariffs on its exports to the EU, while “significant delays” can be expected at the borders, officials said. Earlier, a phone call between Mrs May and Ms Foster failed to provide the breakthrough the prime minister needed for her deal. The 10 DUP MPs, who prop up the Conservative government in Westminster, have opposed the withdrawal agreement in the two previous votes on it. A DUP spokesman said the party’s “position remains unchanged”.Mrs May was due to meet Mr Corbyn before delivering her oral statement to MPs on the decision reached at last week’s EU summit to extend the Brexit negotiation period beyond March 29th. MPs debated and later voted on a proposal to force a series of indicative votes on alternatives to Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement. Successful dealTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he still thinks there will be successful deal on Brexit notwithstanding the pessimism over its likelihood being expressed in Brussels and Westminster.“I’m still confident we will have a deal. As everyday passes no deal becomes more likely and that is just a statement of the fact,” he said. “We are intensifying our No Deal preparations. They have been very much underway now for months if not years. They are being intensified at the moment.Mrs May and senior ministers met leading Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, at Chequers on Sunday in an attempt to win support for her Brexit deal.Earlier, two cabinet ministers rumoured to be ready to replace her as prime minister offered public support to Mrs May, and said there should be no immediate change of leadership. David Lidington, Mrs May’s de facto deputy, and environment secretary Michael Gove both dismissed speculation about a possible caretaker premiership.“I don’t think that I’ve any wish to take over from the PM who I think is doing a fantastic job. If there’s one thing that working closely with the prime minister does it’s cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to do that task,” Mr Lidington said.Mr Gove and Mr Lidington joined the prime minister at Chequers alongside chief whip Julian Smith, Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, foreign office minister Alistair Burt and Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis. Mr Johnson and Mr Rees-Mogg were joined by fellow backbenchers Steve Baker, Dominic Raab, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith and Damian Green. - Additional reporting Reuters and PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: EPAAustralia’s nationalist One Nation party allegedly sought millions of dollars from the US gun lobby and discussed weakening the country’s strict gun control laws with the US National Rifle Association (NRA), Al Jazeera reported.Posing as the head of a fake Australian pro-gun lobby, Al Jazeera secretly filmed top officials from Pauline Hanson’s One Nation allegedly meeting NRA executives in Washington in 2018.It also reported the One Nation officials discussing the possibility of raising A$20 million (€12.6 million) prior to a meeting with a US gun lobby supporter.Concerned about foreign influence in Australian politics, particularly from China, the government introduced laws banning foreign political donations in November last year. The One Nation meetings took place in September.Elections“Reports that senior One Nation officials courted foreign political donations from the US gun lobby to influence our elections and undermine our gun laws that keep us safe are deeply concerning,” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison Tweeted on Tuesday.The two party representatives recorded in the Al Jazeera report, chief of staff James Ashby and Queensland state leader Steve Dickson, confirmed they attended the meetings but denied accepting a donation from the NRA.“These conversations with the NRA were to look at nothing more than their (campaign) techniques,” Mr Ashby told reporters in Brisbane.“This was not about sourcing money from the NRA.”Calls and emails to the NRA headquarters in Virginia were not immediately returned.Australia has some of the world’s strictest firearm laws, implemented after a lone gunman killed 35 people at Port Arthur on the island state of Tasmania in 1996.Australia banned semi-automatic weapons, launched a firearm buy-back scheme after the massacre, and imposed strict licensing rules which require weapons to be locked up when not in use.Al Jazeera said on its website the report was three years in the making.In the report, Mr Ashby and Mr Dickson can be seen allegedly telling NRA officials that with its help the party could win enough seats to gain the balance of power in Australia’s upper house of parliament.“We get the balance of power, very simply that means that we have the testicles of the government in our hand at every given stage,” says Mr Dickson. “Guns, in the scheme of things, are still going to be the be-all and end-all.”MoneyIn another meeting with a US gun lobby supporter, Mr Dickson says: “It’s going to get down to money at the end of the day. We can change the voting system in our country, the way people operate, if we’ve got the money to do it.”The footage allegedly records an NRA lobbyist telling both Mr Dickson and Mr Ashby that it would benefit the US pro-gun movement if Australia’s gun laws were relaxed.“That helps us because the biggest argument we get from folks is, ‘Well look at Australia’,” he says.In an emailed statement to Reuters, Mr Ashby described the recordings as “skullduggery” and said he had referred the matter to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Federal Police over concerns of foreign political interference in the lead-up to a federal election in May.Al Jazeera is Qatar’s state-owned broadcaster.

What happens next? Photograph: UK ParliamentMark DuffyPA WireUK MPs have voted for an amendment enabling them to take control of House of Commons business and stage a series of “indicative” votes on the way forward for Brexit.  How will that work?At 2pm on Wednesday, normal proceedings in the Commons will stop and MPs will then consider a backbench motion setting out the future Commons business, including the arrangements for staging indicative votes on the various options but forward.If more than one business motion is tabled, it will be up to the Speaker John Bercow to decide which one is selected.The architect of the amendment, former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin said he hoped to be able to work with both the government and the Labour frontbenches in coming to an agreement on how it should actually work.After a debate lasting up to an hour, the Commons will then start to consider the various propositions that are put forward. How long will that take?It’s not clear, although Sir Oliver suggested it could be quite a lengthy process covering several sitting days, as the House whittles down the various options to one which can command a Commons majority.He proposed they begin on a “plain vanilla basis” with MPs casting their votes on the various propositions on paper slips at the end of the first debate rather than going through the lobbies in a series of isions which is the normal practice.He said that should stop MPs trying to “game” the outcome based on the sequence in which the votes are called.Once they they have established which of the proposals have “significant” support, he said a way would have to be found — possibly through some form of preferential voting system — to “zero in” on the one around which a majority of MPs could coalesce. Which options are likely to be considered?It will be up to the Speaker, but Sir Oliver said he believed all “serious” proposals that were put forward should have a chance to be debated.At one end of the spectrum that could include a second referendum or revoking the Article 50 withdrawal process altogether. At the other it could include a no-deal Brexit, leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms.In between, there could be proposals for a “softer” Norway-style Brexit — sometimes called Common Market 2.0 — the customs union plan favoured by Labour, and a “harder” Canada-style free trade deal. What is the government’s response?Ministers have warned it sets a “dangerous, unpredictable precedent” while Theresa May has said she will not necessarily be bound by the results — particularly if they are “undeliverable” by the EU.That prompted Tory former minister Nick Boles to warn that MPs could bring forward legislation forcing the government to act if ministers try to ignore the wishes of parliament. How long have they got to sort this out?The clock is ticking. Last week the EU gave Mrs May until April 12th to come forward with an alternative plan if she cannot finally get her twice-rejected Brexit deal through the Commons in a “meaningful vote” this week. - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Prior to sanctions, alcohol imports reportedly doubled to £20 million in the early years of the young leader’s premiership, with champagne seeing a sizeable leap.Meanwhile in Pyongyang’s downtown Gwangbok department store, the monied can avail themselves of a wide range of French or Italian wines or readily available Scottish whisky.  Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May under pressure to offer MPs free vote on alternatives to her dealCan Article 50 be revoked and what would it mean to cancel Brexit?BBC has become spends too much time worrying about gender and race ersity, Michael Buerk claimsComment: In order to stop the Brexit betrayal, Leavers must play a ruthless final handComment: Democrats can no longer rely on conspiracy theories to explain Donald Trump\u0026#39s appealMost of Scotland\u0026#39s best state schools \u0026#39in the 20 per cent wealthiest areas\u0026#39Scientists develop new weapons in the battle to defeat an ancient disease Comment: Trump\u0026#39s opponents must swallow their defeat and focus on policy, not personalityHow a second referendum on Brexit could work: the question, when it could happen and who would winWas North Korea’s vital \u0026#39transformation computer\u0026#39 taken in raid on Madrid embassy?Prince Charles meets Cuban president in historic momentWill Theresa May resign?

Also known as Free Jeoson, it claims to be planning the overthrow of the government of Kim Jong-un. Reports in the Spanish media have also claimed that at least two of the iniduals who took part in the raid had links to the CIA, although analysts say that is unlikely given the timing of the incident, just days before Donald Trump, the US president, met Kim in Hanoi.  A woman walks past North Korea\u0026#39s embassy in Madrid, SpainAccording to Spanish authorities, at least 10 men carrying replica weapons entered the embassy and tied up staff before gathering up computers and employees’ mobile telephones. “In a North Korean embassy, the transformation computer is considered more important than human lives and it deciphers telegrams shared between Pyongyang and the embassy overseas”, he said. North Korea uses a code that is based on pages and words from novels that only the sender and the recipient know, Mr Thae said, making it impossible for Western intelligence agencies to break. If, however, the program that contains the key to the code can be provided to cryptoanalysts then it would be relatively straightforward to read North Korea’s messages, he said. And if its codes are broken, then North Korea must replace its entire method of communication, which will take time and interfere with its ability to interface with its diplomats. Mr Thae’s suspicions are supported by the North Korean government summoning its three most important ambassadors - to Beijing, Moscow and the United Nations - to Pyongyang last week for discussions. Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May under pressure to offer MPs free vote on alternatives to her dealCan Article 50 be revoked and what would it mean to cancel Brexit?Chef reveals Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s appetite for foie gras, caviar and lobsterBBC has become spends too much time worrying about gender and race ersity, Michael Buerk claimsComment: In order to stop the Brexit betrayal, Leavers must play a ruthless final handComment: Democrats can no longer rely on conspiracy theories to explain Donald Trump\u0026#39s appealMost of Scotland\u0026#39s best state schools \u0026#39in the 20 per cent wealthiest areas\u0026#39Scientists develop new weapons in the battle to defeat an ancient disease Comment: Trump\u0026#39s opponents must swallow their defeat and focus on policy, not personalityHow a second referendum on Brexit could work: the question, when it could happen and who would winPrince Charles meets Cuban president in historic momentWill Theresa May resign?

Together, they represent new ways to pay for news subscriptions, TV and games – as well as a new way to pay for anything, with a brand new titanium credit card.The highlight of the new announcements was Apple TV+, a new streaming service built to compete with offerings like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. During the event, it invited many of the world\u0027s biggest stars and directors on stage to talk about the new shows, on which Apple is thought to have spent billions of dollars.But it said it would bring a similar, paid-for and ad-free subscription service, for news and for games. All will allow people to pay a monthly fee for unlimited access to that content.Apple tried to link the various announcements together through references to its corporate principles: stressing a focus on privacy, quality, and the ways that the various products are built to work with the company\u0027s hardware and software.But the different announcements were also linked together in the fact that few details were announced about any of them. Apple only revealed the cost and release date of one of the new products, and gave little information about how many of them will work.Apple announces subscribtion news and magazine service called Apple\u0026nbspNews+A new titanium credit card called Apple Card aims to transform Apple PayHere\u0027s a quick write-up from AP on what the Netflix-competitor \u0026nbspmight look like:\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspis expected to announce Monday that it\u0027s launching a video service that could compete with Netflix, Amazon and cable TV itself.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s a long-awaited attempt from the iPhone maker, several years after Netflix turned binge watching into a worldwide phenomenon.\u0026nbspThe new video service is expected to have original TV shows and movies that reportedly cost\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspmore than $1 billion — far less than Netflix and HBO spend every year.\u0026nbspAlso expected is a subscription service consisting of news, entertainment and sports bundled from newspapers and magazines.\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspis making the announcements at its Cupertino, California, headquarters during an event likely to be studded with Hollywood celebrities.\u0026nbspThe iPhone has long been\u0026nbspApple\u0027s marquee product and main money maker, but sales are starting to decline. The company is pushing digital subscriptions as it searches for new growth.\u0026nbspMaking must-have TV shows and movies that are watchable on any device has propelled Netflix into a force in both Silicon Valley and Hollywood.\u0026nbspBut\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspremained focused on making on gadgets: iPhones, iPads, computers and its\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspTV streaming box for TVs.\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspco-founder Steve Jobs began toying with the idea of building a powerful TV business, but he couldn\u0027t pull it off before his death in 2011. It has taken his successor, CEO Tim Cook, nearly eight years to draw up the script that the company will now try to execute.\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspis very late to this game, eMarketer analyst Paul Verna said. Netflix has become the gold standard in how to create and distribute content, using all the data they have about their viewers.\u0026nbspNetflix\u0027s prowess has attracted 139 million subscribers worldwide. But\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspwill have several other deep-pocketed competitors fighting for consumers\u0027 dollars. Amazon has also become a formidable force in video streaming. Walt Disney Co. is launching its own service this year, armed with an imposing library that became more formidable with its purchase of 21st Century Fox\u0027s films and TV series. AT\u0026ampT is debuting another streaming service built around HBO.\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbsphas plenty of money to spend, though, with about $245 billion in cash and marketable securities. It must prove itself attractive to Hollywood even without a track record for supporting high-quality programming and then ensuring it gets widely seen.\u0026nbspAs part of its efforts to make quick connections,\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbsphired two longtime Sony television executives, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, in 2017. They have reportedly signed up stars such as Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Aniston.And here\u0027s another set of more detailed stuff from Reuters:Apple\u0026nbspInc is expected to finally lift the curtain on Monday on a secretive, years-long effort to build a television and movie offering designed to compete with big media companies and boost digital services revenue as iPhone sales taper.It\u0027s show time is how the iPhone maker billed the affair slated for the Steve Jobs Theater at its Cupertino, California, headquarters. Analysts believe it will be the technology company\u0027s first splashy launch event that will not feature new gadgets or hardware.Hollywood celebrities are likely to trek to\u0026nbspApple\u0027s Cupertino home to greet the debut of a revamped\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspTV digital storefront.\u0026nbspApplehas commissioned programming from A-list names such as Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg.The\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbsporiginal shows are expected to be offered alongside the option to subscribe to content from Viacom Inc and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp\u0027s Starz, among others, sources have told Reuters.Apple\u0026nbspwill join a crowded field where rivals such as Amazon\u0027s Prime Video and Netflix Inc have spent heavily to capture viewer attention and dollars with award-winning series and films.The big tech war for viewers ignited a consolidation wave among traditional media companies preparing to join the fray. Walt Disney Co, which bought 21st Century Fox, and AT\u0026ampT Inc, which purchased Time Warner Inc, plan to launch or test new streaming video services this year.Apple\u0027s jump into original entertainment signals a fundamental shift in its business. Sales of hardware money-makers the iPhone, iPad and Mac were either stagnant or flat in its most recent fiscal year. Without another category-defining new gadget announced to the public,\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspis expected to rely on selling subscriptions and services like video, music and hardware insurance.Revenue from its services segment - which includes the App Store, iCloud and content businesses such as\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspMusic - grew 24 percent to $37.1 billion in fiscal 2018.The services segment accounted for only about 14 percent of\u0026nbspApple\u0027s overall $265.6 billion in revenue, but investors have pinned their hopes for growth on the segment.Apple\u0027s TV push has been cloaked in mystery. Even producers of\u0026nbspApple\u0027s shows are unsure about many of the details about when and how audiences will be able to see their work.On Monday,\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspalso is expected to unveil an\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspNews subscription option featuring content from major publishers and a new credit card with Goldman Sachs to bolster\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspPay.\u0026nbspNOT TAKING ON NETFLIXWhile\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspplans to spend $2 billion on original shows this year and has hired Hollywood veterans to oversee them, it is unlikely to take on Netflix or Amazon directly by including libraries of older shows. Instead, its model is expected to more closely resemble the App Store, offering paid subscriptions to other media companies\u0027 programming and keeping a cut of sales.Ahead of the launch,\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspnegotiated deals that would let\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspbundle and sell networks at a discount, replicating a business model from the cable TV industry, one source familiar with the matter said.Apple\u0027s goal, other sources have told Reuters, is to bring together television shows in one place to make it easier to find, buy and watch them.\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbsphas worked to make it easier to watch the shows on traditional television from manufacturers such as Sony Corp, VIZIO Inc, LG Electronics Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.Apple\u0027s pitch to Hollywood is that it has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of viewers. The company said in January there were 1.4 billion active\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspdevices, 900 million of which are iPhones. It has positioned that as leverage against Netflix\u0027s 139 million global customers and the 100 million subscribers to Amazon\u0027s Prime shipping program, which includes the video service.But the Silicon Valley company has a history of making quick progress when coming from behind: It launched its\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspMusic streaming service years after rival Spotify Technology SA but has garnered 50 million listeners, nearly half of Spotify\u0027s 96 million premium subscribers. And\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspin January said its\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspNews service had 85 million active users after being released less than four years ago.\u0026nbspThe new AirPods, revealed this week, are starting to ship now, according to MacRumors. The site suggests that some UK customers could even receive their new ones before the event today.The iPhone SE – often killed off, but never truly dying, at least not yet – has reappeared back on Apple\u0027s clearance website. The little phone came out in 2016 and was beloved in large part because it re-introduced a small size that Apple has mostly avoided in recent years. If you want something small and affordable, then have a look here. (And do it quick, because they often disappear very soon after they appear.)One thing to think about: lots of people are being really dramatic about today\u0027s event. (The BBC has referred to it as the most significant Apple event since the iPhone, which means ignoring the iPad, the Watch, Apple Music and more.)\u0026nbspBut the more pessimistic case about how exciting today is: Apple already does streaming, in the form of Apple Music. It already offers TV and film and news, in iTunes and Apple News. It\u0027s really just bringing those together.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s obviously a big moment for Apple. But I think it will have lots of convincing to do in the coming days and weeks to make sure people are excited about it as they are. Lots of people already have Netflix subscriptions and are probably tired of paying for them already.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt could be a major moment, or it could be like the launch of Ping. Or it could actually be both.Here\u0027s some details from Press Association about the rivals that Apple will be taking on when it launches its movie and TV streaming service:\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspwill enter the video subscription market later on Monday when the technology giant is expected to announce plans for a new TV and film service.Here is a closer look at the rivals\u0026nbspApple\u0026nbspwill be up against:- NetflixThe most high-profile of the rival services, Netflix has more than 130 million subscribers globally and features a mixture of award-winning original content and other TV and film releases.Users can watch content on-demand on a variety of devices, from laptops to smartphones and video game consoles.It is also possible to download shows to watch offline when users do not have an internet connection.Netflix also offers tiered monthly subscription pricing, with prices ranging from £5.99 for the basic service, to its £9.99 premium service which includes access to compatible content in Ultra HD resolution and the ability to watch on up to 4 different screens at the same time.- Amazon Prime VideoAvailable as part of Amazon\u0027s wider Prime rewards programme which offers faster delivery times on items bought from Amazon\u0027s e-commerce business, Prime Video is a mix of popular third-party content and its open original programming.The service is available across mobile devices as well as Amazon\u0027s line of Fire TV plug-in boxes and sticks and PCs.It also includes Amazon\u0027s X-Ray feature, which enables users to identify actors and songs while watching a programme and find out more about them.Subscribers can choose to pay £7.99 a month for the full Prime service which includes faster parcel delivery and access to Prime Music, or pay £5.99 for just Prime Video.In the US, Prime Video also includes a Channels feature which enables users to sign up to other third-party services, such as those offered by networks HBO and Showtime.- BritBoxExpected to launch later this year, BritBox is a joint venture between the BBC and ITV into the TV streaming market.Said to feature the biggest collection of British content available on any streaming service, it is expected to include high-profile programming from both the BBC and ITV, and could also include content from Channel 4 and Channel 5.It is being touted as a long-term home for many shows after they are no longer available on catch-up services such as the BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub.Pricing and full launch date are still to be confirmed.- Disney+Another service still to be launched, Disney+ is expected to go live in the United States later this year with a collection of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic-based content.As well as classic films and TV episodes, the platform is also expected to host a wide range of original programming that will appear first on Disney+.Further details, including pricing and UK release date, are still to be released.(My personal opinion is that I don\u0027t know how excited I can be for\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspvideo streaming service. (And that\u0027s as a devoted Apple Music user.) But if they were able to make this new one actually more like a comprehensive platform, which would show me the best things from everywhere and avoid the same mistakes that have made Netflix so tiresome, well then perhaps that might OK, or even better.\u0026nbspAnd for what it\u0027s worth I think this will be the case – that the endless comparisons to Netflix are a little wide of the mark. Instead, I think it could be more like a traditional cable company, offering you the ability to subscribe to different providers and bundling them all in one app. It already offers similar functionality in its TV app. And it feels like far more close to what\u0027s needed, as opposed to yet another service that claims to be a platform for different movies and TV shows but really wants to trick you into watching all of its own, like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.)Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That will include recommendations for series that you have started but not finished, as well as recommendations for new ones.Latest updates as Apple releases new productsThose shows will be pulled both from Apple\u0027s own shows – if a user is a subscriber – as well as to any other companies they subscribe to.The subscriptions themselves will be made easier through a new tool called Apple TV channels. People will be able to sign up to the HBO channel through the app and then add it to their account, using their Apple login, it said.The new TV app won\u0027t only be limited to Apple\u0027s own devices. It will also come to smart TVs made by companies like Samsung, allowing people to get access both to Apple TV+ and the other new features even if their device is not made by Apple.That marked a major change of strategy for Apple, which has always limited its apps to its own devices. But it described during the launch event how it was focusing on services, in an attempt to encourage people to sign up to subscription services to make more revenue from people who own its devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Additionally, business volumes and employment have fallen over the last quarter.“Brexit is now a national emergency.

This is what he did at the Dormen Food Company, and then at Lovedean Granola.However, after selling the granola business he was “looking around for something to do”.Created with Sketch.Stunning photos of food by Anett Velsberg Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Then I met Paul,” he says, referring to Paul Lindley, the founder and former chief executive of Ella’s Kitchen.“He’s a very persuasive and inspiring man,” says Cuddigan. “I have been selling stuff to supermarkets for 25 years but Ella’s has changed what I think about business and how it should be done.”One of the reasons that Ella’s Kitchen sparked Cuddigan’s interest was that the opportunity to work there arose just after the birth of his first baby,\u0026nbsp“so I was quite interested in the baby arena”, he says.“In any business there’s a certain intuition. For me having two kids means I’m interested. It certainly helps, it means I can empathise with our customers.”He joined the group in 2011 as a director, and became chief executive in 2013, taking over from Lindley.\u0026nbspThe widely held view is that it’s difficult to step into a founder’s shoes, but Cuddigan says that wasn’t the case for him.“Most people say it’s really really tricky but I have to say Paul was incredible. He knew how difficult it would be for me to take over with him sitting in the background, I knew it was difficult for him because he wanted to stay involved but he took a massive step back. Taking over was relatively easy because he was there to support me, and he gave me total autonomy.”Ella’s Kitchen dominates in two very important, overlapping markets – it makes food for babies and toddlers, and all its products are organic.“We are really proud of what we have achieved nutritionally,” says Cuddigan.Food in general has become too cheap and undervalued\u0026nbspand as such I think the quality of the food that we are eating is pretty poorHowever, despite the popularity of his brand, he thinks there is a long way to go with encouraging British consumers to make healthier choices when it comes to food.“I’m not sure that people are opting for healthier alternatives.”Cuddigan blames the low price of the products on offer in UK supermarkets.“Food in general has become too cheap and undervalued and as such I think the quality of the food that we are eating is pretty poor.”He gives the example of a ready meal that might retail for £1.50: “Once you have taken in the producers’ margin, you are probably talking about something that’s been made for 15p.Food exports to be turned away in no-deal Brexit ID mark \u0027chaos\u0027The surprising ingredients lurking in your foodInflation hops up with rising beer and food prices“We need to reset that in consumers’ minds, that good quality food costs money.”He readily acknowledges the reason Ella’s Kitchen is an outlier in this regard.“It’s difficult but ever so slightly easier in our category, because parents prioritise their children’s foods.”This adherence to high-grade, organic ingredients has made Ella’s Kitchen the popular brand that it is today, but it has also created obstacles.For one thing, it makes it difficult to compete on price. In recent years, Cuddigan says, Ella’s\u0026nbspKitchen came up with a new snack offering, but as it got closer to the launch, it became clear the product would be “more than two times the price of the nearest market rival” and so it had to be spiked.So would the company opt to use cheaper ingredients in order to lower retail prices?“The temptation is there but we are not going to do it, that’s a zero-sum game,” says Cuddigan.Meanwhile, the brand\u0026nbspis also facing turbulent times heading into Brexit.“A hard Brexit would be devastating to our business, because we have a very complicated UK supply chain and we use high-grade organic produce,” says Cuddigan.“We have been planning for over a year. In terms of time resource it’s been one of our biggest projects.“The most frustrating thing is we don’t know what we are planning for.”However, Cuddigan is clear that potential disruption will not have any impact on the quality of the products Ella’s Kitchen brings to the market.“The number one priority has to be trust,” he says, illustrating this point with a reference to the horse meat scandal which rocked the UK’s food sector in 2013.“We survived that scandal, we knew we were going to be fine, because we knew exactly where our meat was coming from.”“I want to be happy at work and I want to do work that’s valuable,” Cuddigan says.“I feel quite strongly that when you look at these companies that have been in scandals they will have values that are stuck up on the wall. If they followed those values they wouldn’t be in those scandals.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The average two-year fixed rate for borrowers with a 5 per cent deposit is 3.30 per cent, while the average rate for borrowers with a 10 per cent\u0026nbspdeposit for this type of mortgage is 2.7 per cent.The narrowing rate gap has been driven by healthy competition by providers looking to attract people with a 5 per cent\u0026nbspdeposit, Moneyfacts said.Darren Cook, a finance expert at Moneyfacts, described first-time buyers as the lifeblood of the mortgage market.He said: Providers need to factor in the greater potential of default on higher-LTV (loan-to-value)\u0026nbspmortgages, which is why rates are typically higher at 95 per cent\u0026nbspLTV - but as we\u0027ve seen, they\u0027re increasingly willing to sacrifice these margins in order to compete.Mr Cook said the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage for borrowers with a 10 per cent\u0026nbspdeposit has changed little since October 2017, increasing from 2.62 per cent\u0026nbspby 0.03 percentage points to reach 2.65 per cent\u0026nbspnow.Over the same period, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate for borrowers with a 5 per cent\u0026nbspdeposit has fallen significantly, from 4.19 per cent\u0026nbspin October 2017 to 3.30 per cent now.Mr Cook said: This is fantastic news for potential first-time buyers who are looking to find their first step on the housing ladder.However, even though mortgage rates at the 95 per cent\u0026nbspLTV tier are falling, it may not be that simple.Since the financial crisis, the Financial Conduct Authority has introduced clear affordability measures that mortgage providers must follow, so potential first-time buyers will still need to jump through several affordability hoops before they find themselves on the property ladder.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

The average two-year fixed rate for borrowers with a 5 per cent deposit is 3.30 per cent, while the average rate for borrowers with a 10 per cent\u0026nbspdeposit for this type of mortgage is 2.7 per cent.The narrowing rate gap has been driven by healthy competition by providers looking to attract people with a 5 per cent\u0026nbspdeposit, Moneyfacts said.Darren Cook, a finance expert at Moneyfacts, described first-time buyers as the lifeblood of the mortgage market.He said: Providers need to factor in the greater potential of default on higher-LTV (loan-to-value)\u0026nbspmortgages, which is why rates are typically higher at 95 per cent\u0026nbspLTV - but as we\u0027ve seen, they\u0027re increasingly willing to sacrifice these margins in order to compete.Mr Cook said the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage for borrowers with a 10 per cent\u0026nbspdeposit has changed little since October 2017, increasing from 2.62 per cent\u0026nbspby 0.03 percentage points to reach 2.65 per cent\u0026nbspnow.Over the same period, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate for borrowers with a 5 per cent\u0026nbspdeposit has fallen significantly, from 4.19 per cent\u0026nbspin October 2017 to 3.30 per cent now.Mr Cook said: This is fantastic news for potential first-time buyers who are looking to find their first step on the housing ladder.However, even though mortgage rates at the 95 per cent\u0026nbspLTV tier are falling, it may not be that simple.Since the financial crisis, the Financial Conduct Authority has introduced clear affordability measures that mortgage providers must follow, so potential first-time buyers will still need to jump through several affordability hoops before they find themselves on the property ladder.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Norfolk on February 5 2016Instead of relying on whale bones, the team behind the new study opted for barnacles as a more reliable indicator.“The signals we found in the fossil barnacles showed us quite clearly that ancient humpback and grey whales were undertaking journeys very similar to those that these whales make today,” said Larry Taylor, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley.“It seems like the summer breeding and winter feeding migrations have been an integral part of the way of life of these whales for hundreds of thousands of years.”Aleria Jensen, NOAANMFSAKFSC)Specifically, the Pacific coast of Panama appears to have\u0026nbspserved as a\u0026nbspwhale meeting point for at least 270,000 years.While most barnacles glue their hard shells to rocks, there are varieties that are specialised for living on the bodies of whales.This provides the barnacles with free passage to nutrient-filled waters, and the opportunity to breed with other barnacles when the whales carrying them meet up to mate.Whale starved to death with record amount of plastic in stomachIceland announces plan to kill over 2,000 whales in next five yearsMr Taylor and his colleagues focused on types of oxygen molecule preserved in the shells of both modern and ancient barnacles.As the oxygen composition changes depending on where in the ocean whales are, this gives an idea of their movements over time.Both prehistoric and modern samples yielded measurements that suggested time spent in a variety of different waters, with patterns pointing to a summer feeding season and winter breeding season.The scientists hope that their technique, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could be used to perform more prehistoric detective work.“We want to push the technique further back in time and across different whale populations,” said Dr Seth Finnegan, a co-author also based at the University of California, Berkeley.\u0026nbsp“Hunting for fossil whale barnacles is easier than whales, and they provide a wealth of information waiting to be uncovered.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

So we\u0027re just going to play and have fun.Wonder will be joined by special guest Lionel Richie, with more artists still to be announced.\u0026nbspTickets go on sale at\u0026nbsp9am\u0026nbspon Friday 29 March.Created with Sketch.The 40 best albums to listen to before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave.

Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

Even at that stage, when the full depth of Brexit’s tangle was not yet clear, would-be challengers were so horrified of being forced to do a job that has so obviously killed May’s career, that they told their foot-soldiers to back down and keep the PM in place.Then there was Labour’s attempt to call a vote of no confidence in the whole government, which saw the same Tory MPs who had gone on TV to decry May as incompetent suddenly back her, fearful of either losing their seats in an election or letting Jeremy Corbyn into power.May would rather have an election than a second Brexit referendumThere have also been\u0026nbsptwo really humiliating cabinet revolts. One\u0026nbspsaw the PM\u0026nbspallow top Remainer ministers to vote against her approach and another saw her change path under the threat of resignations from top Brexiteers.Neither proved fatal due to the even balance of disdain with\u0026nbspwhich her leadership is viewed if she does something to outrage one side, she receives the backing of the other and vice versa.Which brings us to Sunday.Despite the repeated blows to her authority, the humiliations and the rebellions, those that have passed and those still to come, May looks like she will be there until she decides to leave of her own volitionMany\u0026nbspministers discussed ditching the PM – but some wanted to put her deputy David Lidington in place, an ex-minister for Europe who backed Remain, campaigned for Remain, and is thus totally unacceptable to Brexiteers.The others suggested Michael Gove, whose defection to Vote Leave in the run up to the 2016 referendum is possibly the turning point that saw it go on to victory. Unacceptable to Remainers.The only really clear cut way to depose May is through the Tory rules that\u0026nbspallow her to be toppled. But those same rules disallow more than one attempted coup each year, meaning another bid cannot now be tried until December 2019.A mass, unified cabinet rebellion, possibly the only other conduit for a change, looks unlikely because – as Sunday showed\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspboth sides fear leaving a vacuum for the other side to fill.So despite the repeated blows to her authority, the humiliations and the rebellions, those that have passed and those still to come, May looks like she will be there until she decides to leave of her own volition.And it is that, an offer to quit, which is the final ace up her sleeve – something that might convince rebel MPs to back her deal. But she will not commit to it unless it is absolutely clear it would secure the majority she wants.Until then, Ms May’s leadership will rattle on, coughing black smoke down the increasingly potholed road of Britain’s Brexit saga.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We’re here because we want to make today joyous.

They came bearing balloons and banners, face paints and flags – and, above all else, smiles and good humour.“Have you ever seen a more polite crowd?” asked Silvia Angelotti, an Italian business analyst who has lived in London for 22 years. “Believe me, a march of a million people in Italy – it is not so calm, not so orderly, I think.”Heseltine says PM’s No10 speech ‘affront to parliamentary democracy’The best signs from the Put It To The People march in London‘Million’ protesters gather in London for march against Brexit Celebrities fund transport to Brexit protest for new EU referendumSurrounding Ms Angelotti as she walked down Whitehall – to where speakers included London mayor Sadiq Khan, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and The Independent’s editor Christian Broughton – was a sea of noise and a mile of colour. Or, rather, a mile of blue and yellow.The shades of the EU were everywhere, from teenagers resplendent in streaks of yellow eyeliner to mums (and dads) donning long blue wigs. Think cup final day on Wembley Way, and you have the right sort of vibe. Only here, supporters were asking – given the closeness of the first result, given the misinformation they say was spread, and given the ever-unfolding sense of calamity – for a chance to rethink and replay.“That’s not an unreasonable request,” said Sorcha Kirker, an archaeology student at University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) in Scotland. “Theresa May has given parliament two votes on this – and she wants another – so why are the people being denied a second say? That isn’t democracy.”Ms Kirker herself\u0026nbspwas speaking after a 28-hour journey to be in London. The 27-year-old lives on Orkney. To get to the capital, she had to leave home at 4.30am on Friday, take a boat to the mainland town of Thurso, travel by train to Inverness, and then, at 9pm, catch the 12-hour overnight bus to London.If you’re reading this anytime between 8.30pm on Saturday and 10pm\u0026nbspon Sunday, she’s still on her way back home again.“Am I tired?” she asked. “Well, I got about two hours sleep on the bus so that’s something. You come to something like this and adrenalin takes over anyway. There are 24 of us here from the UHI, and we’ve all come because this is too important to miss because of something like geography. It’s our future. Brexit is a disaster. It takes away so many opportunities from young people that our parents had – that can’t be fair.”She and her group were carrying massive EU flags – but placards were largely the order of the day.Indeed, if national referendums could be initiated by the sheer originality of signs being waved alone, it’s probably fair to say, the Electoral Commission would, right now, already be organising a Final Say vote.They varied from pop cultural references (“Frankie Says Remain”) to the poetic (“Let’s stay among the stars”), to the somewhat crude: “If only Nigel’s dad had been so keen to pull out,” read one.Bright yellow stickers featuring the slogan “Bollocks to Brexit”, meanwhile, were everywhere. Including, by the end of the day, entirely covering the Cabinet Office front door in Whitehall. After one person\u0026nbspstuck their sticker there, hundreds more protestors followed suit – turning this historic door yellow.“If Theresa May really thinks she knows how we feel, she might want to look at her own Cabinet Office entrance next time she passes,” said Rob Hollinger, as he added another circular sticker to the mass. “She says she speaks for the British public. She doesn’t speak for anyone here.”It was a sentiment shared by 14-year-old Jacob Henry. “I got off my Xbox to be here,” his placard told the world.The youngster, from Milton Keynes,\u0026nbspwas there with his parents and 16-year-old sister Alice.“I don’t know if any of this will make a difference,” his dad Leroi, a 49-year-old academic, said. “But maybe the momentum is starting to move in favour of a second vote. I feel the country is starting to shift but I don’t know if it will be too late. But I just think, as a family, we felt we had to try to do something. We had to be able to say in future we gave this a shot.”Pursued by a toilet, Farage’s foot soldiers slog 270 miles for BrexitIt was a hopefulness and positivity that infused the spirit of the whole procession.With a petition asking for Article 50 to be revoked topping 4\u0026nbspmillion signatures even as the march started, many people felt, now more than ever, the tide of opportunity was turning towards them.Certainly Alice Joinel hoped so. She was the mother of possibly the youngest march participant of all. Carried in a papoose\u0026nbspwas nine-week-old Anouk.“How’s she found it?” said Alice, who works in publishing in London. “She’s actually slept through most of it. Woke up for the odd feed, then gone back to sleep again. She seems pretty unfazed.”The 32-year-old came because she felt it was important for the little one’s future.\u0026nbsp“Leaving the European Union is going to make her future so much harder and with so fewer opportunities,” she said. “And as a parent, that’s unbearable. So we had to come. Her dad – my partner –\u0026nbspis actually French, so you might say she wouldn’t even be here without the EU – that’s how important it is to us.”As the day came to a close – anti-Brexit chants still filling the twilight – a band could be heard finishing off in Trafalgar Square: Brass Against Brexit.How did march go for the group?“Brilliant,” said James again. “A few of us in this band play\u0026nbspGlastonbury every year and we’ve played the Rio carnival and, of course, it’s impossible to compare. But this was special: just people getting into it, waving their flags, giving us thumbs up. It felt like we were a part of\u0026nbsphistory.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

One cabinet minister told The Independent that the “chicken endgame of Brexit” had now begun, with eurosceptic MPs who previously refused to back Ms May’s deal will soon be forced to decide if they can accept a potentially terminal delay to Britain’s departure from the bloc instead.In dramatic scenes, MPs\u0026nbspbacked the\u0026nbspplan\u0026nbsptabled by ex-Tory minister Sir Oliver\u0026nbspLetwin, which now allows backbenchers to start the process of organising a series of “indicative votes”, in a bid to discover what Brexit compromise carries a majority in the Commons.While the votes pencilled in for Wednesday will be non-binding on the government, Sir Oliver, who was backed by fellow ex-Conservative minister Nick Boles and Labour’s Hilary Benn, has suggested the group could use its new power to try and pass actual legislation leaving the government no choice but to follow parliament’s will.The Conservative Party is assuring its own destruction over BrexitBrexit supporter who hit Jeremy Corbyn with egg is jailedWatching Brexit from Australia, I don’t know how anyone is keeping upMinisters who quit to oppose the government included Richard Harrington, Steve Brine and Alastair Burt.In his resignation letter, Mr Harrington said: “At this critical moment in our country’s history, I regret that the government’s approach to Brexit is playing roulette with the lives and livelihoods of the vast majority of people in this country who are employed by or otherwise depend on businesses for their livelihood.“Further, as the UK’s industry minister, the clear message I have been receiving from the business community is that the failure to secure a deal and to rule out a hard Brexit is resulting in cancelled investment decisions, business being placed abroad, and a sense of ridicule for British business, across the world.”As the prospect of the defeat loomed, Ms May made clear that she could not simply abide by whatever MPs demanded, saying: “No government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is.“So I cannot commit to delivering the outcome of any votes held by this house. But I do commit to engaging constructively with this process.”Brexit: How can Theresa May be removed as prime minister?Earlier in the day during an emergency cabinet meeting, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay repeated a warning that the government could be left with no option but to call an election if parliament demands an outcome the government is unwilling to deliver.Attorney general Geoffrey Cox agreed at the cabinet table that if MPs mandate a softer Brexit an election might be inevitable, with Andrea Leadsom said to have concurred.One minister said: “There was a discussion, it was not about setting a direction of travel, more just a statement of fact that things might become ungovernable.”During a statement in the Commons, Ms May also confirmed that the date of Brexit has\u0026nbspnow changed in international law to 12 April and would also be altered in UK statute in the coming days.MPs to vote on her Brexit deal for a third timeA member of the cabinet told The Independent: “All the focus is now on 12 April. Parliament will do what it will, and it will be down to Conservative MPs\u0026nbspwho have refused to back the deal to now do so if they don’t want to see Brexit delayed for a long time.“This is now the chicken endgame of Brexit. It’s coming to an end in the coming days.”Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay had urged MPs to vote down the Letwin amendment earlier in the debate, saying: “It’s the prime minister’s deal that is the way to deliver what the people voted for in 2016 and 2017.“That is why it’s right the government maintains control of the order paper in line with constitutional convention and why the amendments this evening should be defeated.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The 1991 movie was directed by Kenneth Branagh and starred his then-wife Emma Thompson, as the murder victim whose husband (Branagh) is found guilty of the crime and condemned to death. The film then jumps from 1949 to 40 years later, with private detective Mike Church (Branagh) begins to investigate the identity of a woman who appeared at the orphanage where he grew up.Peele has mentioned on several occasions that this is an important film to him. Stanley Kubrick\u0027s famous film was adapted from Stephen King\u0027s equally famous novel, and stars Jack Nicholson as writer and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance, who becomes the caretaker of an isolated hotel. A terrifying figure from a children\u0027s book becomes a living nightmare for a young boy and his mother. This 2014 supernatural psychological thriller has its characters stalked by an entity who they can only escape from by having sex with someone, who then becomes the next victim. 510 A Tale of Two SistersSouth Korean filmmaker Kim Jee-woon made this twisted account of two sisters in the countryside who are haunted by awful visions of their late mother.Hitchcock\u0027s classic but still-terrifying horror movie stars Tippi Hedren as Melanie, a woman who finds herself the victim of an increasing number of vicious bird attacks. Hedren\u0027s account of the gruelling film-making process, where Hitchcock went to great effort to elicit real fear from her, was turned into a movie of its own. This dark home invasion thriller is about two men who hold a family hostage and subject them to a series of twisted games.In this highly controversial film, a young girl escapes a slaughterhouse where she has been held captive by unknown captors. After being placed in an orphanage, she suffers terrifying visions of a disfigured woman. The film delves deeper into the world of a secret society that shares terrifying ideas about the creation of \u0027martyrs\u0027. 910 Let the Right One InThe Swedish version (although the US remake was pretty good) is about the friendship between an introverted, bullied young boy and a vampire girl. One of the best works from M Night Shyamalan, master of \u0027the twist\u0027, about a haunted boy sent to therapy because he \u0027sees dead people\u0027.Jordan Peele was clearly influenced by the scissor scene in Dead Again.

This dark home invasion thriller is about two men who hold a family hostage and subject them to a series of twisted games.In this highly controversial film, a young girl escapes a slaughterhouse where she has been held captive by unknown captors. After being placed in an orphanage, she suffers terrifying visions of a disfigured woman. The film delves deeper into the world of a secret society that shares terrifying ideas about the creation of \u0027martyrs\u0027. 910 Let the Right One InThe Swedish version (although the US remake was pretty good) is about the friendship between an introverted, bullied young boy and a vampire girl. One of the best works from M Night Shyamalan, master of \u0027the twist\u0027, about a haunted boy sent to therapy because he \u0027sees dead people\u0027.Us\u0026nbsphas received mostly positive reviews from critics.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspgave it four stars and praised Peele for giving it that same mix of morbid fascination and extreme dread experienced by the character of the young girl at the Santa Cruz fairground.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We were airlifted onto the helicopter which was quite a frightening experience,” Mr Browne told the BBC.He added: “I’d never been in a helicopter before, there were a lot of high winds, hovering overhead and the winchman came down and we were then collected up and so I shut my eyes as we arrived into the helicopter and there were 15 of us for about a 20-minute ride.”Some 20 injured passengers had been taken to hospital, Viking Cruises said, while others had only minor injuries.Police in Moere og Romsdal said the ship’s crew had managed to anchor in Hustadvika Bay, amid fears the vessel would run aground.The boat was then\u0026nbsptowed to Molde on Norway’s west coast with 436 passengers and 458 crew members still on board.Norwegian media said the majority of the cruise ship passengers were British and American tourists. The ship had been due to arrive in the Essex port of Tilbury in England on Tuesday.“I was afraid. I’ve never experienced anything so scary,” Janet Jacob\u0026nbsptold Norwegian broadcaster NRK. She said her helicopter ride to safety came amid strong winds “like a tornado”,\u0026nbspcausing her to pray “for the safety of all aboard”.The Norwegian Red Cross said: “Many have also been traumatised by the experience and need care when they arrive on shore.”Hustadvika rescue centre (AP)US passenger John Curry said he had been having lunch as the ship started to shake. “It was just chaos.

But this country won’t know where things are going to end up until April .On Wednesday, No Deal ­suddenly seemed a likely option again. The EU were saying they would only grant Theresa May’s request for an extensionher Brexit deal passed before March , something that is highly unlikely.I am told that at the No Deal ministers’ meeting on Wednesday night, “the mood was totally dferent to previous meetings, as people thought it might actually happen”.It was agreed that a small group of ministers — Theresa May’s effective deputy David Lidington, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Health ­Secretary Matt Hancock, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley — would meet again on Friday morning to take the preparations to the next stage.But on Friday morning that meeting was cancelled.Why  Because after the EU agreed to halt the UK’s ­departure until at least April , No Deal is once again highly unlikely.This delay meansMay’s deal fails again, ­Parliament will have enough time to step in and take ­control of the process.The three options now are: May’s deal passes, a softer Brexit is agreed in the next few weeks, or there is a much longer extension to allow a General Election to be held, which could mean no Brexit at all. At the moment, the Brexit deal isn’t going to pass.Getting it through was always going to be hard, but the errors Mrs May made this week have made it even more ­dficult.As one Secretary of State puts it: “She would have been much better off spending three days in bed.”Her speech on Wednesday night, criticising MPs, was also ill-judged, given that they are who she needs to win over.It was particularly mistaken given May had turned down an invitation to address her own MPs that evening.One normally mild-mannered backbencher tells me: “It was offensive to us. You decline to come and talk to us — then insult us.”The Government’s domino strategy for winning the vote required getting the DUP to come on board.There is only one way to change this dynamic — for May to offer to goher deal passes.This would instantly change the debate. In the past few days, one Tory MP who wants No Deal and another who wants a second referendum told me they would vote for a ­withdrawal agreementthey had a guarantee she would go.“An increasing number of people are saying their vote is contingent on her going,” says a senior backbencher.As one Cabinet minister admits: “Even that may not be enough.” But without it, there’s no chance of the deal passing next week.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.AMID all this uncertainty, one thing is looking increasingly clear: Britain will have a new Prime Minister soon.Opinion has turned against Theresa May ­following her ill-judged speech on Wednesday.“She has managed to offend everybody,” one previously loyal minister tells me.And one Secretary of State fumes: “She’s alienated Parliament, the Cabinet and the EU.”There are no shortage of leadership candidates sounding people out.Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, has the support of more ­Cabinet ministers than anybody . He is seen as a safe pair of hands and as having the ­emotional intelligence to hold the party together.Sajid Javid was the frontrunner. But as always happens in Tory leadership contests, that has put a target on his back. He has had a dficult few weeks and is losing support.Cabinet ministers are convinced that Andrea Leadsom is running. They point out how, at Cabinet this week, she spoke in a string of highly quotable lines about Leave voters being let down.Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is also expected to go for it. But many think she is more interested in framing the debate and pushing her pro-growth agenda than anything .Michael Gove is being urged to stand, with Mel Stride, the well-connected Treasury minister, at the forefront of efforts to persuade Gove to run.Matt Hancock is another being encouraged to enter the race. He is the new toast of the party donor classes, who think he offers competence. One MP describes him as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”.On the backbenches, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson are competing to be the Brexiteer ­candidate. Raab’s campaign is better organised – he has ten MPs gathering support for him.But Johnson has the proven electoral record and greater experience. One thing to remember, though. Tory leadership races are like the Grand National: Messy, unpredictable and the favourite rarely wins. THE absurdity of Labour’s Brexit position is that it accepts the withdrawal agreement.What it takes issue with is the political ­declaration, which isn’t legally binding.Voting through the Brexit deal would not stop Labour from getting to any of the softer Brexit ­outcomes that it has been proposing in recent months.You could negotiate almost any kind of Brexit from the withdrawal agreement.But Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t want to vote for it because he doesn’t want to vote for a “Tory Brexit”.It would bring the withdrawal agreement, ­without the political declaration, to the Commons and dare Labour to vote it down.If Labour blinked and the withdrawal agreement passed, we would then be out of the EU and into the transition ­period.The EU would also be satisfied and consider us to have ratied the agreement.If Labour voted down the withdrawal agreement, then it would be clear what their motives were.IF there is no chance of the Brexit deal ­passing unless Theresa May promises to go, who can tell her that This is what ministers have been discussing with each other in the past  hours. They think her No aides won’t, so somebody  needs to.The obvious candidate is Sir ­Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee of Tory MPs. Brady is discreet and respected. But it is now time for him to put on his grey suit and carry this message to May.May promising to go so long as the withdrawal ­agreement is passed would show that it really isn’t all about her.And history would view her in a much more sympathetic light.ONE reason why the UK might end up leaving the EU by April  is the Labour leadership don’t want the European elections to take place any more than ­Theresa May does.They know parties in favour of a second referendum would attack Labour for its equivocation on this point.Jeremy Corbyn, who walked out of a meeting this week because Chuka Umunna had been invited, wouldn’t want to give the breakaway ­Independent Group such a perfect launch pad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK itself has been more successful in recent years in growing its trade with markets outside the EU than with those that are inside the single market and customs union.It baffles me that so many British politicians have so little faith in Britain that they think we would be sunkwe had to stand on our own two feet.The mistakes that have brought us to this point are well known: agreeing to decide the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement before settling the future trading relationship with the EU agreeing to a “backstop” to prevent a “hard border” in Ireland allowing the militant Remainers in Parliament to damage Britain’s negotiating position by taking “No Deal” off the table and allowing our exit date to be deferred.If only we had accepted the EU’s offer two years ago to have a big Canada-Plus free trade agreement, we could have locked in certainty for business and spent the last two years trying to improve upon it!The question now is what’s the best way to achieve the proper Brexit that the British people voted for nearly three years ago I understand why so many of my Tory and DUP friends have voted against the PM’s deal. I told her in November the “backstop” made it impossible for anyone who wanted to leave the EU to vote for it: it could lock the UK into the EU customs union for ever.That is why I voted against it the first time. It’s also why I tabled the “Brady amendment” — which was voted through at the end of January, telling the PM to go back and ensure the “backstop” couldn’t become a permanent trap.When the Government’s lawyer Geoffrey Cox said the changes agreed would allow a way out in most circumstanceswe were faced with a tough choice.To take a risk and support the deal or keep voting against, hoping something better would emerge. It was defeated a second time, with a big majority against.Those of us who really want Brexit to happen and British politics to be able to get on with other things are now faced with taking a massive political judgment.By voting for the pretty threadbare deal Theresa May brought back from Brussels, we can ensure some sort of Brexit and then a new negotiating team that believes in what it’s doing can work to get something worthwhile out of the future relationship after we have left.If we don’t vote the deal through this week, it no longer looks like Theresa’s promise that “no deal is better than a bad deal” will be honoured. Two years ago,  per cent of you voted for a political party — whether Tory or Labour — that promised to implement the referendum decision.Two years on Labour is angling for a second referendumand lots of other MPs are pushing for a Brexit that amounts to staying in. Some want endless delay, a few are at least honest enough to admit they really want to ignore the decision of . million voters altogether.Meanwhile, the EU is creaking. Just as the EU is set for crisis, this country is poised for success.British businesses are sitting on big cash balances but are crying out for the certainty that will allow them to invest.If we deliver on our promise to leave in the coming weeks, Britain will prosper. If we get stuck in the departure lounge, our country will suffer.For heaven’s sake, let’s settle this now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the deal fails again it seems Philip Hammond and David Lidington will be knocking on the PM’s door to tell her the time has come to make an exit.But in the midst of this paralysing crisis even that is not an easy option.There is no clear route to appointing a successor in the short term. And with the party at loggerheads even a swt transition to a caretaker PM is perilous.After this week’s turmoil we face being stuck for some time with a lame-duck Prime Minister, whoever it may be.Britain needs a miracle to avoid it.The crushing of IS in Syria is a massive achievement.Defeating this self-proclaimed caliphate is the beginning of the end for a reign of terror which has claimed , lives and spawned , attacks over four bloody years.The courage and sacrice of the ­Western-backed forces that fought so fiercely to drive the jihadis from their final stronghold has been rightly praised by Theresa May.But she was also wise to caution that the ousting of the religious fanatics from their territory will not end the risk they pose.Many hardened fighters will go to ground in the area so they can continue to wage guerrilla warfare.Other dangerous extremists will no doubt flee to Europe and even to this country, still fuelled by their murderous hatred of the West.Like the mythical hydra with its many heads, cutting off one risks generating others in its place.Our security forces must now be on alert for a fresh wave of Islamic-inspired terror closer to home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she has lost the backing of much of the country and now her party.Her deal has only one, slim chance of achieving a majority in the ­Commons.That isshe pledges ­immediately to resign and set in motion the election of her successor as Tory leader and PM after we leave the EU on the new deadline of May .If she does so, Tory Brexiteers and the DUP must back the deal. Becauseit fails again this week we are heading for a much softer Brexit — or none.That will be a catastrophe for the country, the Tories and Parliament.Mrs May deserves huge credit. She is a dedicated public servant with an unshakeable sense of duty, who in  took on the greatest challenge of any PM since World War Two.She has stuck to it through thick and thin, showing remarkable resilience in the face of repeated humiliations, rebellions and a relentless barrage of vitriol from almost all-comers.Unlike so many she has determinedly respected the will of the Leave majority. The very concept of democracy has been degraded in many other countries, yet she has ­resolutely defended ours.She must now take the next principled step — and show she is not just another craven politician determined to cling to power.Mrs May has insisted all along that not only must the referendum result be honoured, as promised by both main parties, but that it must mean leaving the EU’s central institutions — the Single Market and Customs Union — as well as the remit of its courts.She has maintained that the power to trade independently outside the Brussels club must be secured. It is the economic prize of Brexit.This was exactly the right course. Those arguing to soften those red lines are almost entirely those who regret Brexit and wish to neutralise it.Sadly, many mistakes were made. A Remainer, Mrs May appointed a weak Cabinet of Remainer friends, most of whom considered Brexit a disaster to be managed rather than a historic opportunity to exploit.The Brexiteers she did appoint — David Davis, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and later Dominic Raab — were sidelined and ignored.The Government triggered Article  far too early without a plan for our departure. In hindsight it should have made rapid plans for No Deal from the outset, giving us a position of strength from which to negotiate.Mrs May said “No Deal is better than a bad deal”, only to have Treasury bureaucrats refuse to prepare for it.After her disastrous  election her sole focus became achieving Brexit while holding her party’s warring factions together and fending off Remainer rebellions in Parliament.While our economy, employment and wages have grown strongly there has been policy paralysis, with mediocre ministers left blundering along. We need not list here all Britain’s problems. They are many, and obvious.Her Brexit deal is not the worst imaginable. Those are the so-called Norway Plus option — which is not Brexit in any way — or the permanent Customs Union, brainlessly championed by Corbyn, which destroys the economic case for leaving.No one should pretend it is a great deal either. But it ensures that Brexit finally happens, ending the fractious Leave Remain debate and refocusing Britain on the far more crucial negotiations for a future trade agreement.The DUP and the Tory ERG will have to hold their noses and vote for it. And to win that unlikely support, Mrs May must set in place a truly dignied exit, culminating in a new leader.Theresa May will then go down in history as a great public servant, as the leader who delivered Brexit and proved to the British people that our democracy is robust and far, far more important than any inidual.PM, it’s time to move on.MAKE no mistake: the kne crime epidemic is now a national crisis.It’s tempting to think that it’s just gangs in London and our other biggest cities that are the cause of rising violence.But shocking figures demonstrating how far and wide this disease has spread must be a wake-up call for the police, the Home Office and the Cabinet.That we’ve now got young gangsters playing sick games in which points are awarded for stabbing certain parts of the body can lead to only one conclusion: we’ve completely lost control of our streets.Throughout the spike in violent crime, the Government has responded with a tin ear. They’ve allowed the Labour Party — under Jeremy Corbyn of all people — to become the party of law and order.At the last election, the Tories got a battering about police cuts and it was one signicant reason they lost their majority.With the very real possibility of another ballot coming soon, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid and the Chancellor must get a grip.It’s vital that they give police chiefs the cash and the powers that they need.OUR prisons are failing.The latest revelation, that drugs and phones are being smuggled in via the inside of dead rats, is just a symptom of the mess they’re in.Prisons should keep people who deserve it locked up and get them ready for a le on the straight and narrow.The Justice Secretary is considering scrapping short sentences because prisons are doing such a bad job of rehabbing people, leaving offenders on our streets who should be behind bars.And eventhey do end up inside, with violence on the up, it’s no surprise lags form rival gangs. That turns prisons into training centres for hardened criminals.Where is the Government  Promises of reform and a crackdown on violence seem to have produced precious little.The consequences of a busted prison system will be felt on our streets.SO-CALLED Islamic State might not have any physical presence left, but we can’t be complacent about the murderous ideology they spread across the world.Their promise of a reign of terror across the continent sends a chill down the spine.We must find and prosecute those IS fighters who have ed to the UK — believed to be as many as  — and spare us the inevitable leftie hand-wringing.There have already been far too many innocent victims of IS’s twisted dogma.We must do everything possible to ensure there are no more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Far from it. I have been a fan of the Aberdeen fishmonger’s son for a quarter of a century.As Education Secretary, he proved he has the brain and balls to take on both Brussels and the public sector “Blob” he blames for sabotaging effective government.But his credibility seemed shot after he signed up to Mrs May’s botched BRINO — Brexit In Name Only.He was also bruised by his reputation for kning his pal David Cameron and then fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson. Friends claim he did not want to be labelled with a third count of disloyalty.Today his judgment seems rather shrewd, coupled with his recent morale-boosting Commons attack on Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist rabble.Faced with the risk of losing Brexit altogether — and likely defeat in a snap election — there is an outside chance BRINO will limp over the line at the third time of asking.If DUP MPs sign up — andTheresa May promises to step aside — Brexiteers might fall in behind.There are too many “s” in that sentence for comfort but despite Speaker John Bercow’s chicanery, a last-gasp victory is still possible. Which puts Mr Gove, , up against a cavalry of leadership rivals.  DAVID LIDINGTON, . The “deputy PM” is an even bigger surprise as joint-favourite. He is mooted by Europhile ministers such as Amber Rudd as caretaker PMMrs May is dumped.Leavers including ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith are dismayed by their “appalling disloyalty”.“They should be censured, sacked or, at the very least, apologise and they should shut up,” he stormed yesterday.  BORIS JOHNSON, . The ex-Foreign Secretary will winhis name is on the final shortlist for party members — which is why Remainers and Mrs May herself will do anything to stop him.Bojo, a proven election-winner, is sleeker and slimmer since splitting with we Marina and teaming up with glamorous Carrie Symonds, . Signicantly, he was twice invited as a powerbroker into No last week to save her deal. Might yet be persuaded.  DOMINIC RAAB, . This experienced international lawyer was picked by Mrs May for his knowhow on world trade negotiations. He resigned after being sidelined in favour of Whitehall EU fanatic Olly Robbins. A winnerhe is the only Brexiter on the shortlist.  JEREMY HUNT, . Smooth-talking Foreign Secretary and multi-millionaire businessman.Mr Hunt switched to become a Leaver after voting in  to stay in the EU. Brexiteers are suspicious of late converts, especially those who remained in Cabinet under Mrs May.  SAJID JAVID, . This son of a Pakistani bus driver who rose to become Home Secretary should be a frontrunner for the top job.But like Jeremy Hunt, he is haunted by his decision to back Remain despite posing as a strong Eurosceptic.  ANDREA LEADSOM, . The Commons Leader would be PM nowshe hadn’t flunked her leadership bid and blocked Gove.She has forged new respect by taking on slyly vicious Speaker Bercow.Unranked dark horse MATT HANCOCK, . The new Health Secretary suffers from being a George Osborne protege. But even Brexiteers believe him to be his own man.A prominent Leaver tells me: “Matt is highly intelligent, extraordinarily able. He has the potential to be PM.”If politics is a numbers game, here are some  referendum statistics to help MPs as they weigh up their options for Theresa May’s successor.Leave won in the  Referendum by .million against Remain’s .million.Leave constituencies outnumbered Remain by  to .Of these, Tory Leavers outnumbered Remainers by  to  and Labour’s by  to .In Parliament,  MPs support Leave, while  back Remain.There is a message about our future political stability in those figures.Now he claims No Deal will create a medicines crisis and turn Kent into a car park.Britain has proved him wrong, with investment rising, more jobs and higher pay – while his beloved European Union lumbers towards recession and le on the dole for under-s. As the ex-Chancellor told me afterwards: “All’s fair in love and war.” Or to put it another way, a lie is halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stop-gap agreements are in place.But, and it’s a huge but, the harsh, unavoidable truth is that No Deal — while technically in Theresa May’s gt — is not available.Our Remainer-stacked Parliament will use every trick in the book to block it.That’s the practical political reality. Outrageous, but true.Yes, admittedly, leaving with No Deal is for now the legal default. But anti-Brexit MPs have the numbers to wrest control of the Parliamentary agenda and pass primary legislation to prevent No Deal.That is why all Honourable members who believe in democracy must hold their collective nose and back Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement — which, while deeply imperfect, at least gets Brexit over the line. Andthat backing is conditional on May standing down, even better.Britain needs a Prime Minister who sees Brexit not as a disaster to be managed, but a chance for national renewal.Mrs May can still secure Brexit, and salvage some dignity,her agreement gets through. But she must then make way for someone with genuine vision to negotiate our future EU relationship.Her deal is, of course, ghastly. It leaves Britain without voice, vote or veto over EU law-making and subject to European Court of Justice jurisdiction.We hand over £billion we don’t technically owe.This terrible outcome reflects her botched  election and lack of negotiating nous.Labour’s cynical ambivalence, with Jeremy Corbyn trying to wreck Brexit and spark a general election, hasn’t helped.Big business has lobbied hard, with corporate vested interests determined to keep Britain in the EU’s protectionist customs union and smaller rivals ensnared in red tape.And we have seen epic intransigence from Brussels to make Brexit as tough as possible in order to discourage others from leaving.We can still leave, though, as long as pro-Brexit MPs don’t fall into Brussels’ trap.Last week’s EU summit granted Mrs May an “un-conditional” Article  extension from March  to April .The EU’s aim was to encourage the European Research Groupof Tory Leavers to keep voting down Mrs May’s agreement, in the hope we would default to No Deal.France’s President Emmanuel Macron is now calling on the EU to “just get rid of the UK”.Anonymous eurocrats want to cut off “the gangrenous limb” that is Britain.It is all just spin, designed to fool Brexiteers into rejecting Mrs May’s deal and giving Commons ultra-Remainers the chance, before April , to thwart No Deal, tipping the UK into a long Article  extension period in which Brexit can be entirely crushed.Look at the damage the Remainer establishment has already done, consistently undermining Brexit since losing the June  referendum. Think of the additional damagethe EU forces us into a much longer delay.That is why the ERG must back the Withdrawal Agreement. Mrs May’s deal may stink but it gets us out of the EU’s legal structures once and for all.Let’s take this opportunity to make Brexit irreversible, killing off the danger and further uncertainty of a deeply isive second referendum — which would be disastrous not just for democracy, but also UK investment.For once the Withdrawal Agreement has passed and we have left the EU, negotiations between London and Brussels will become more technocratic and much less heated.The political temperature will drop, allowing us all to move on from this tortuous impasse.Once Britain has left, we can then fight our way out of Mrs May’s terrible deal.International law is, in large part, a matter of public opinion and power-broking.The world will see, once the US and China are clamouring to do trade deals with Britain, that the EU is being entirely unreasonable trying to keep us locked in its insular customs union.Post-Brexit, the Irish will also come on side, helping to solve “border issues” which were always entirely solvable.That is, once Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has saved face and “not backed down to the Brits” ahead of our withdrawal.Why did “B******s-to-Brexit” John Bercow prevent MPs voting on Mrs May’s deal this month  Because he could see it was going to get through the Commons.Leading ERG members were onside, and the DUP were very close, which would have unlocked the cascade of -odd Labour MPs from Leave constituencies who want Brexit — enough to get us legally and psychologically over the line.Brexit “true believers” have a choice. They can “never surrender” and let Mrs May’s deal die. That would result in a long Article  delay, risking the entire Brexit project, which would be a democratic calamity.Or they can show political savvy and bank this deal, making our EU withdrawal irreversible, before finishing the job of securing an advantageous future relationship under a new pro-Brexit Prime Minister.The only way for the UK toto moderate politics after our historic June  referendum, is to leave the EU. The only way to ensure that, from where we are now, is to back Mrs May’s agreement.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will mean that wounded Mrs May is forced to hand over control of the order paper to them on Wednesday to try and work out a way forward.In another extraordinary night in the House of Commons:Brexiteer Suella Braverman told BBC Newsnight: Tonight weve seen a Parliamentary massacre.Priti Patel said it was another example of the political class promising one thing and delivering another.Trust in politics is broken, she said.And almost immediately MPs who want a second referendum called yet again for Parliament to overturn the result of the historic  referendum vote.A spokesman for the Brexit department said this evening it was disappointing to see the amendment pass, and pleaded with MPs to come to a realistic outcome when the Commons debates the way forward in just two days time.They added: This amendment instead upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous, unpredictable precedent for the future.While it is now up to Parliament to set out next steps in respect of this amendment, the Government will continue to call for realism – any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the EU.Parliament should take account of how long these negotiations would take, andthey’d require a longer extension which would mean holding European Parliamentary elections.Jeremy Corbyn congratulated the House of Commons for taking control off the PM and throwing Parliament into more chaos, and said: Where this government has failed this House has and must, succeed.And EU boss Guy Verhofstadt praised tonights news, tweeting: An opportunity to build a cross-party cooperation leading to an enhanced political declaration and a closer future relationship!Today the PM refused to back Sir Olivers plan for a series of so-called indicative votes, saying she was sceptical that such a plan would ever work.When we have tried this kind of thing in the past, it has produced contradictory outcomes or no outcome at all, she told MPs earlier.There is a further risk when it comes to Brexit, as the UK is only one half of the equation and the votes could lead to an outcome that is unnegotiable with the EU.MPs could end up forcing through a second referendum or even try to reverse Brexit altogether.The PM promised never to give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is.However, she tried to see off the rebellion by promising to engage constructively with this process.David Lidington said this evening that the Government would bring forward similar votes this week but refused to go into more detail, which wasnt then enough to win MPs over.Alternative Brexit options are expected to include a number of softer options including:But any softer Brexit option risks destroying the Conservative party.The PM said still planning to bring her deal back to the Commons for a third time, possibly after showing Brexiteers what the risk would be in an attempt to force them to vote for her deal.But theres not enough support to bring it back as things stand at the moment.Today Tory MPs called for her to step down, evenshe does get her deal through Parliament in the next few days.Leave-backing MP Rachel Maclean warned today that the Commons can only unite around a position that bears little or no resemblance to what Leave voters voted for.She added: This is why I have consistently voted for the WA to end this turmoil, and get us out of the EU, as I could see this coming a mile off.But that would lead to a y extension while Parliament figures out another plan, the PM warned today.A slow Brexit which extends Article  beyond nd May, forces the British people to take part in European Elections and gives up control of any of our borders, laws, money or trade is not a Brexit that will bring the British people together, she said.FOR the first time in more than a hundred years the Government wont be controlling what happens in the House of Commons on Wednesday.Tonight MPs voted to withdraw an obscure procedure from them and hand back control to MPs.Sir Oliver Letwins amendment, which passed and then was later confirmed in two crushing defeats for the PM, will let MPs have a say on what kind of Brexit they want to see.It will mean that there can be a series of votes on Wednesday on other options aside from Mrs Mays deal - on anything MPs want.The Speaker has a considerable amount of power in this situation, according to Sir Olivers plan.He will choose what motions to be put forward and lead MPs to vote on their preferred Brexit options.But his plan doesnt force the Government to actually take on board whatever MPs say they want.It will instead put it forward with a view to the Government putting forward a plan for the House to debate and vote on in future.Mrs May had argued she would give MPs the time to do this on her terms, but her promises were not enough to persuade dozens of Tories to defy her tonight.I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision.And in doing so we must confront the reality of the hard choices before us.The PM appeared to totally kill off leaving without a deal, telling MPs: Unless this House agrees to it, No Deal will not happen.No Brexit must not happen."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000478498735.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the sun time up theresa may front page","story":"The front page was picked by the media in the US, Canada Japan and Australia as well as electrying social media back in the UK.The Washington Post had already listed the PM’s five “famous fights for survival” dating back to her disastrous snap election of .Tory MP Nigel Evans – secretary of the influential  backbench committee – said The Sun had got it “spot on yet again” with our demand that she resigns to seal her deal and deliver Brexit.He said: “The Sun is famous for being able to tap into what the Great British people are thinking – and I think you’ve got it spot on.“People want her deal to go through then they want someone  to carry out the next phase of negotiations.

I never knew what they were and I didn’t know why they were in my room or what they did with me.However, the mum-of-two, who lives in the southwest of France, didnt realise what this meant until she was hypnotised in .She continues: I recognised I had been abducted by extra-terrestrials throughout my le.Throughout my le Id been left with unexplained marks on my body.One time I had three coin shaped bruises on my thigh that formed a triangle, and on another occasion I had a throbbing pain in my right side close to my kidney.It was only thanks to hypnosis I realised that the pain was a result of the probes they had used inside me.After her encounters, Myriame became the head of CeroFrance, an association created in  which holds regular meet ups for those who claim to have been abducted by extra-terrestrials.Many of us are terried by what have happened, she continues. Some have lost their jobs and lost their marriage. They are very disturbed by what’s happened. But together we can safely talk about what has happened to us.The members of the group have much in common: many say they have had their oian eggs or sperm removed or harvested, some also say they have been abducted since childhood.According to CeroFrance members, aliens target the same families multiple times.Why are we taken  It’s the big question, Myriame adds.I don’t know why we’ve been selected. Some of us think it might be easier for them to perform their procedures and operations on us.We know they follow family lines. My parents have been abducted. My children in their childhood were taken too.Each time I was abducted a probe would enter my body and my oian eggs were removed. I was powerless to stop it.When I was in therapy I was able to discover that the aliens viewed humans as a brutal destructive and suicidal race. That we are destroying our planet and our governments are crazy.So they are creating a new race of species with a dferent civilisation.While encounters are often scoffed at for being outlandish or unbelievable, all the victims say its happened more than once.The most profound abduction happened to me when I was staying at my employer’s apartment in the French Alps, says Myriame.It was on the sixth floor I was in bed enjoying the view of the stars through the ceiling window. I began to doze off so I turned off the light.That’s when I heard a click. The room suddenly lit up and I saw the window was open and a cable was hanging down. I couldn’t move. I was paralysed in bed.When I came round I was on a metallic table. There was a soft fabric over me and it was hard to breathe - I could hear the movement of surgical instruments and machines.Then the cable entered my body. I tried to fight it but I couldn’t. Little grey aliens were all around me and there was a large insect alien too.Eventually I opened my eyes and I was back in the bedroom, it was dark and the window was closed – there was no one there, but there was a heavy atmosphere in the room.I couldn’t sleep in the apartment again and checked into a hotel for the rest of my stay. I had an awful lower abdomen pain afterwards.Myriame claims she kept her experiences and fears to herself. She only remembered what happened to her because of the hypnosis she underwent seven years ago.She explains it is ‘traumatising’ to live through the experience of being taken - she also believes the aliens communicate with her via telepathy.The extra-terrestrials don’t want us to remember what happens to us when we are taken so they try and mask our memories, she adds.When I remembered the second time, I recalled being in bed. There was no roof on the house - instead there was a massive round circle above and I saw a red net coming for me.The red net took me back to the dome room and again they harvested my eggs.After I understood what had happened to me – I was much calmer. I wasn’t going mad. It’s something people don’t talk about for fear of others thinking they are crazy.Like Myriame, Gerry Battles from Co Limerick, says he was dazzled by bright light before being abducted onto a ship by an alien with a big cone head and beautul, ginormous eyes who communicated to him telepathically in December .Garry believes he was sent back to pass on a message that in over  years time a giant asteroid the size of  the Irish province Munster is going to obliterate our planet.The asteroid will approach your planet from the th Quadrant, according to his alien abductor.Hilary Porter,  - who claims she was first abducted in the s when she was just five - agrees with the theory aliens want to create a hybrid race.After years of research following an abduction that she claims left her with triangular suction marks on my stomach, blood suction marks, Hilary believes aliens target certain human “tribes” whose genetic make-up is of more interest.“The Celtic tribes from Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and Brittany are definitely on the list,” she says.“They are trying to make alien human hybrids and it seems the genetic material of these races are more compatible.”Typically after an abduction Hilary suffers migraines, and wakes up with bruising or bloody marks on her clothes or bed sheets.Sceptics rationalise abductees experiences as everything from sleep paralysis to  memory syndrome, but there is no definitive answer to explain what abductees are experiencing.Psychologist Nicolas Dumont has spent seven years speaking to  abductees in France.There isn’t a typical profile, he says. We often see all forms of personalities, from those who have never heard of aliens, to those who have as a child been fascinated by space.There is no distinction across the social classes either. I’ve seen professionals, farm workers, scientists – it’s a broad range.He is open-minded about the alien experiences.If you’re sceptical it is easier to dismiss these experiences as psychiatric problems or sleep paralysis, he adds.I’m open to it. I listen to their experiences.They have marks on their body. They have seen things around their home. We’re finding that they often report a spiritual change too: they have visions or even develop psychic powers.One woman was inexplicably cured of cancer. She had a brain tumour which covered her temporal lobe in her brain like a spider’s web. After an abduction, the tumour completely disappeared.Her brain has been scanned but we found no trace of it. We don’t have a scientic explanation for this.Nicolas says that while he sees more female abductees than men – this is normal throughout all psychological consultations.Women are more likely to contact and want to talk. Men keep it inside. They worry people will think they’re mad or paranoid.According to Nicolas, abductees talk about six dferent species of aliens.The little grey ones are popular sightings and they tend to be the ‘workers, Nicolas explains. They have a distinct job during these abductions.We also know of the tall white ones that oversee what’s going on. Abductees often regard them as protective as they are stronger and more paternal.The hooded aliens can be small or large. They wear a big coat with a hood and you don’t see their faces.Then there are the reptilians, insects - a very tall Scandinavian-type alien, and also there are similar very tall blue people.As for Myriame she believes that a day will come when she can look at the skies and stars without the worry of being abducted.As we humans age, they take us rarely, she says.The thinking is they try to leave us alone to live out the rest of our lives without their interference.The last time I was taken was in February . I knew it had happened because I had the traces on my body which they sometimes leave behind.I have lived a good le but I can honestly say I would have preferred itit never happened to me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MPs held a historic, unprecedented vote last night to oversee the Parliamentary timetable themselves. And they will use it to hold indicative votes to finally flesh out what MPs want to do next with Brexit. Just  days before the EUaposs April  deadline to leave or face a long extension, we still donapost know what Parliament wants. But we may soon find out, with votes due to be held tomorrow night - and theyaposll take shape throughout the day. Here are  fast facts you need this morning.  Theresa May lost control of Brexit last night in a damning defeat for the Prime Minister.MPs voted - to take ownership of the Commons schedule in an unprecedented parliamentary defeat. They backed a plan by Tory veteran Sir Oliver Letwin that will allow MPs to control business from pm tomorrow in the House of Commons. They are due to use the power to hold a string of “indicative votes” on the next steps for leaving the EU. Mrs May didnapost just lose control of Brexit, but also her party.  Tory rebels voted against the government. The government issued a furious statement branding last nightaposs vote a dangerous, unpredictable precedent.  Under the plan, Parliament will now start staging aposindicative votesapos on the future for Brexit from pm tomorrow. MPs are expected to bring forward competing options such as a customs union or second referendum, and vote on pink slips of paper for any that they could potentially back. Architect Hilary Benn, of the Commons Brexit Committee, said at this stage he wouldnapost press for a apospreferentialapos vote, but instead tot up the total support for each option. At a later date they could be whittled down. But the process is still unclear. And thataposs why all eyes are on the MPs, who will work out the process in more detail today. Thereaposs a huge catch though. Theresa May has made clear she could ignore whatever MPs vote for - and she vowed not to give a “blank cheque” of government support. Whatever happens, the UK must come up with its next steps by April  and agree either a deal or a longer extension with the EU, or revoke Article . Otherwise, we will crash out with no deal.  Backers believe last nightaposs vote is just the start, and could well lead to a softer Brexit being implemented. Steve Brine, who resigned as a Business Minister to oppose the government, told the BBC it would focus some minds adding: Those on my side who donapost like the deal, maybe they will realise that the House of Commons is prepared to act. And, anything from here, as far as they are concerned, gets softer in terms of Brexit. Indicative votes will be non-binding, buttheyaposre ignored, Tory rebel Nick Boles warned MPs could take the next step of legislating against Theresa Mayaposs will. Mr Boles said last night: We will be relying on the Government to reflect Parliamentaposs wishes. If, ultimately, the Government refuses to listen to what Parliament has voted for then we will look to bring forward a Bill, pass an Act of Parliament that will require the Government to reflect Parliamentaposs wishes in its new negotiating mandate. A government spokesman said it would “continue to call for realism – any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the EU. They added: Parliament should take account of how long these negotiations would take, andthey’d require a longer extension which would mean holding European Parliamentary elections.  In a damning indictment, three ministers voted to take power away from their own government and put it in the hands of MPs. Therefore those ministers - Alistair Burt, Richard Harrington and Steve Brine - all had to resign. In a blistering letter, Business Minister Mr Harrington - who had threatened to resign for months - accused the government of “playing roulette with the lives and livelihoods of the vast majority of people in this country.” He added the Brexit chaos has led to “a sense of ridicule for British business across the world. And he condemned the refusal to rule out the nonsense of No Deal, saying Theresa May could not pursue her plan at the price of suicide. More ministers could follow tomorrowTheresa May refuses to allow free votes in the aposindicativeapos process. Remainer Cabinet ministers will be demanding a free vote in todayaposs Cabinet meeting from .am. . Theresa May’s Brexit deal finally looks dead - but it could still rise from the ashes  The Prime Minister’s Brexit deal has already been twice defeated in the House of Commons. Finally she confirmed she would not bring it back today, admitting there was not enough support for a third roll of the dice. At the time she insisted she would still try and hold a third “meaningful vote” on the deal this week. Now MPs have voted to take control of the process, the focus has shted away from her third deal. But some may be privately hoping that last nightaposs dramatic move will force Tory Brexiteers and the DUP to come on side. The government has until Thursday to hold a third meaningful voteit wants to secure an Brexit extension to May . Otherwise weaposre in sudden death time to April .

She also failed to confirm whether she would accept the resultMPs agreed an alternative way forward.  And while she insisted that a no-deal Brexit was off the table, No officials then said it was not. Mrs May faced more calls from Tories to quit while Parliament plotted to wrestle the Brexit process away from Government. Several Remainer ­ministers were on the brink of quitting to back the plan after the Government confirmed it would oppose the vote. Her failure of leadership amid the crisis infuriated MPs. One of her Cabinet ministers said: “It’s extraordinary that at this crucial stage we still don’t know what is going on.” The UK has been given until April  to agree a deal, then must either crash out of the EU or delay for an alternative plan. Before tonight’s voting , Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer told the Commons: “The PM has lost control of the meaningful vote. “She has no idea when it might be put or whether it is winnable. “She has lost control of the negotiations… The PM also appears to have lost control of her party. And today she is likely to lose control of Parliament.” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the PM must accept her deal will never be approved, and that she must look for alternatives.He said: “Given the Prime Minister admitted she does not have the numbers for her deal, will she accept today her deal is dead and the House should not have its time wasted giving the same answer for a third time ” He called on Mrs May to support plans for indicative votes. He said: “Rather than trying to ­engineer a way to bring back the same twice-rejected deal, will the Prime Minister instead allow, rather than fight, plans for indicative votes  She cannot both accept her deal does not have the numbers and stand in the way of finding an alternative that may have the numbers.”    Mrs May defended her opposition to Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin’s plan for MPs to take control of the Parliamentary timetable. “No Government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is,” she said. Sir Oliver plans to take over the timetable for days, even instructing the Government to go back to Brussels with a new plan. Mrs May has  hours to get a deal through under the timetable agreed with the EU. She wants to plough on with her plan even though there were signs opposition to it was growing. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said “there were big gaps” between what they want and what the deal offers.    Mrs May told MPs it was with “great regret” she felt “as things stand” there was still not sufficient support to bring her deal back for a third vote. She also infuriated hardline Brexiteers by saying their preferred no-deal exit was no longer an option. She angered the DUP by suggesting no-deal would be so damaging for Northern Ireland no PM could allow it. But within moments of making her remarks, Downing Street officials were rowing back. MPs will tomorrow get a vote to delay Brexit Day to April ,a deal isn’t passed, or to May it is. A Government source said an election might be “the only way out of this”. Senior eurosceptics who visited the PM at Chequers over the weekend have allegedly called themselves the Grand Wizards, apparently without realising it refers to the Ku Klux Klan.

The former minister claimed Mrs Mayaposs comments represented the most shameful surrender by a British leader since Singapore in  - when Singapore surrendered to Japan, something Sir Winston Churchill described as a heavy and far-reaching military defeat. His comments were greeted with jeers in the House of Commons and derision by those watching from outside parliament.One Twitter commentator using the handle @bornatotter said: My dad was captured at the fall of Singapore and endured over three years of slave labour. I object to opportunist politicians likeCrispin Blunt abusing his memory in this way. That’s not me arguing for leave or remain. It’s me demanding respect for my dad and his comrades. Another said: Comparison with Mayaposs speech and fall of SingaporeCrispin Blunt proves he still views the world with archaic th century imperial mindset. Reigate needs MP with global st century outlook, not a colonial throwback. Responding to the Prime Ministeraposs statement,  Jeremy Corbyn said the Governmentaposs approach to Brexit has now become a national embarrassment and urged her to allow indicative votes on alternatives to her Brexit deal.MPs have twice rejected a no-deal Brexit and they look to have a chance to influence what happens nextMrs Mayaposs deal does not receive parliamentary approval.    The exit date of March  has already been delayed. Speaking after Mrs Mayaposs latest statement to the Commons, Mr Blunt said: Does the Prime Minister understand that by taking no-deal off the table at the behest of this Remainer Parliament, she has just put the final torpedo into her own deal and any real prospect of Brexit, and that her statement will represent the most shameful surrender by a British leader since Singapore in    Mrs May responded: Can I simply say that what I said in my statement was that this house has voted twice to reject no-deal, and may very well continue to reject no-deal, and may very well, as a House, attempt to ensure that no-deal cannot take place.As the SNP has already indicated, they will be moving a vote to revoke Article  to reverse the whole result of the referendum.Members opposite have been complaining that I have refused in my answers to take no-deal off the table. The reality is that this House has shown its intention to do everything it can to take no-deal off the table and we all need to recognise thatwe are going to deliver on Brexit then we need to recognise that situation.Labour leader Mr Corbyn earlier said the Prime Ministeraposs deal is dead before adding: Rather than trying to engineer a way to bring back the same twice-rejected deal, will the Prime Minister instead allow, rather than fight, plans for indicative votes She cannot both accept her deal does not have the numbers and stand in the way of finding an alternative that may have the numbers.    Mrs May would not be moved and refused to commit to respecting the result of any indicative votes. To jeers from the opposition, she said: I think itaposs important that nobody would want to support an option which contradicted the manesto on which they stood for election to this House. MPs elected to this House at this time have a duty to respect the result of the referendum that took place in  and attempts to stop that result being put into place or attempts to change the result of that referendum are not respecting the voters and not respecting our democracy.

UK travellers wonapost need a visa for trips of less than  days, as long as the plan is adopted by EU leaders and the European Parliament.

An EU official told reporters France, the Netherlands and Belgium have set up  new border posts and hired , customs officer to cope. In a statement, the Commission warned of signicant disruption for citizens and businessesthere is no deal. The EU warned: UK citizens will no longer be citizens of the European Union. They will be subject to additional checks when crossing borders into the European Union. Again, Member States have made considerable preparations at ports and airports to ensure that these checks are done as efficiently as possible, but they may nevertheless cause delays.    An EU document added: Travellers are advised to take account of possible delays at border posts as of the withdrawal date. Especially at those with heavy volumes of traffic . It comes as MPs prepare to vote on what type of Brexit theyaposd like, more than , days after the referendum and weeks before weaposre meant to leave. So-called aposindicative votesapos will be held on Wednesdaya bid to hold them passes in the House of Commons tonight. Meanwhile Theresa May dumped plans for a third vote on her Brexit deal tomorrow amid fears it would not pass. If the deal passes by Friday, the UK will leave the EU on a later date of May , giving enough time for laws to be in place.    The EU has published  preparedness notices which are similar to just over  published by the UK government in case of No Deal. They warn UK travellers will no longer be able to rely on their European Health Insurance Cardfor free healthcare in the EU, and vice versa. Some countries have moved to ensure reciprocal healthcare for visitors from the UK - including Spain. But in countries where this is not the case travellers should consider taking out private travel insurance, the EUaposs documents warn. Meanwhile pets will be badly hit as the EUaposs pet passports become invalid for UK travellers after April ,there is No Deal. The UK government has already said pet owners must start the process of getting approval to travel four months before their trip. And the EU documents confirm pet owners will need a third country pet passport.  The EUaposs documents also confirm what most already knew - that the UK will enjoy no transition periodthereaposs a No Deal Brexit. That contradicts Boris Johnson, who even today called for an implementation period in a No Deal Brexit until . And the EU confirmed mobile phone giants will be free to bring back roaming charges for UK travellers - something that was already known in the UK. The EU will be required immediately to impose tarfs and rules on imports and its borders with the UK, the Commission said. It added: UK entities would also cease to be eligible to receive EU grants and to participate in EU procurement procedures under current terms. Basic air and road links will be maintained, while rail safety authorisations will be recognised for a strictly limited three months to allow a long-term deal. UK students already studying in the EU under the Erasmus programme will be able to complete their studies and continue receiving funding or grants.

During phone-ins on the Labour anti-Semitism allegations, Galloway framed the controversy as a vehicle to attack the Labour Leader, and received broad support for his view.When he received a dissenting opinion in a text, Galloway called the sender an ignorant woman, and branded another listener who disagreed with him as a rag picker. The former MPaposs talkRadio  could now face sanctions including the shortening or revoking of its licence after Ofcom found Galloway was in breach of impartiality rules. Galloway was found in breach on two counts over the Corbyn material. In addition to a previous broadcast on the Salisbury poisoning case, Galloway has been found in breach of the rules by Ofcom three times.    The watchdog is now considering sanctions against his radio . A spokesman for Ofcom said: Our investigation found that these phone-in programmes breached our due impartiality rules. They failed to give due weight to a sufficiently wide range of views on allegations of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party. We are minded to consider imposing a statutory sanction for these breaches. The Licensee now has an opportunity to make representations to us, which weaposll consider before proceeding further. Ofcom received complaints about Gallowayaposs shows on July  and August  , prompting an investigation into due impartiality. The watchdog found that while it was legitimate to broadcast programmes in support of Corbyn, principles of balance had to be maintained. Ofcom said it is concerned that Galloway continues to express pride in his broadcasts despite their content breaching rules. TalkRadio could now face sanctions, which may include a fine of up to £,, in light of the fact that Galloway has been found in breach of the rules multiple times on the station. Gallowayaposs show has previously breached impartiality rules with comments that aired after the Salisbury poisoning involving Yulia and Sergei Skripal. On three occasions, when the audience contributions opposed his own views position, Galloway joked that the listeners who had sent in their dissenting messages were in Broadmoor psychiatric hospital. Ofcom investigated a complaint that the programme, broadcast on March , contained biased and unbalanced views about the response of the UK and Russian governments to the poisoning. Galloway said in the introduction to his July  show: Jeremy Corbyn has this week been the victim of a crazed, unhinged assault by the agents of the powerful. A frenzied attack to destroy him for fear that he might win. The proximate method is the exploitation of deep-seated Jewish fear. Literally summoning up the demons of Nazism against Britainaposs finest anti-fascist. He added later: A pig that is the British media and political class that is frightening Jewish schoolgirls in London on a giant Goebbellian lie that Jeremy Corbyn not only hates Jews but that the existential future, the existence of Jewish le in Britain, is threatened by this mild-mannered geography teacher in his woolly jumper. A talkRadio spokesperson said: You expect robust opinions from George Galloway, but we accept that on this occasion he crossed the line.

She told Westminster Magistratesapos Court: An attack like this is an attack on our democratic process. The attack on Mr Corbyn came about a week after the party announced it would support a second referendum. The Labour Leader was shocked and surprised by the attack, which has prompted his team to work on increasing his security, Westminster Magistratesapos Court heard on Monday.   Prosecutor Kevin Christie said Mr Corbyn was with Labour shadow home secretary Diane Abbott at the Muslim Welfare Centre in north London after visiting the Finsbury Park Mosque on March .Mr Corbyn took off his shoes and sat down next to his we Laura Alez and a group of people who seemed to be in great spirits. Suddenly, he felt a strike to the right side of his forehead and then realised someone had reached over his right shoulder and struck him, Mr Christie said. As he was struck he heard a male voice shouting: aposRespect the vote.apos Mr Corbyn had left the room to wash himself when he realised he had been struck by an egg. Murphy continued to shout respect the vote while being restrained by staff.    Mr Corbyn, who was largely uninjured but left with a red mark, noted Murphyaposs face was contorted with rage and he appeared very aggressive. In a victim impact statement read to court, the Labour leader said: I was shocked and surprised when the assault occurred as I have always felt safe and secure at the Muslim Welfare House. The assault was completely unprovoked and threatening. Whilst Iaposm determined to make sure Iaposm able to interact with people as I always have, I now have to be more cautious. Murphyaposs solicitor Malik Aldeiri, in mitigation, blamed his clientaposs frustration and anger borne out of the political situation we find ourselves in. He felt he was making a statement. He believes his civil rights were violated and this was a demonstration by him against what he says is a failure by Parliament to adhere to his democratic vote, his lawyer added. There were gasps from Murphyaposs supporters in the public gallery as he was led to the cells. Remain-supporting politicians have spoken about heightened tensions turning into abuse and violence, with independent MP Anna Soubry saying she has been targeted by very, very serious death threats.

Mum Phyllis Gaut, , spoke of her grief as vigilante Ieuan Harley, , was jailed for a minimum of  years for the brutal revenge killing of her son. David Gaut, , was stabbed more  times after near-neighbour Harley discovered the truth about his dark past in prison. Gaut killed a -month-old toddler and served more than  years in prison before being released to start a new le in Harleyaposs home village.    But outraged Harley repeatedly stabbed him with a kne and screwdriver before mutilating his body in disgust at his crime. Gautaposs mother said her son had paid the price for the  murder and blasted: This man is no better than David, he too is a killer. David spent over  years in prison and paid the price for what he did. David struggled to understand how much the world had moved on since he had been in prison. I understand how some people will not sympathise David is dead. As a family we do not condone what David did. I believe his release from prison was a chance for him to do some good. His death has left a huge void in my heart. This man has taken away the opportunity to prove he had changed. I only hope he will have remorse for what he has done.  Newport Crown Court heard Gaut had moved into a flat next door to Harleyaposs friend David Osborne in the village of New Tredegar, Gwent, after being released from prison. Gaut pretended he had been in prison for murdering a soldier. But his neighbours discovered the truth about his criminal past after searching his name on the internet. Gaut was lured to Osborneaposs house on the pretence of borrowing a DVD - only to be brutally murdered by enraged Harley. In a statement read to the court, his mother said: “My son David was brutally murder by a group of vigilantes that decided they had the right to sentence my son to death. “David has been taken away in the cruelest way. Taken away by people to he trusted, who he thought were his friends. “Ieuan Harley used the fact that David was a killer as an excuse.  Harley was convicted of murder and perverting the course of justice. He was jailed for le with a minimum of  years. Judge Mr Justice Clive Lewis told Harley: I am sure that you Ieuan Harley killed David Gaut because you found out that he had killed a child and you decided he should be made to suffer. “Quite simply what you did was murder. “You carried out a brutal and savage killing of another person.” He told Harley the killing showed cruel and near-sadistic behaviour.  Osborne, , Harley and fellow friend Darren Evesham, , dragged Gautaposs dead body back next door and tried to clean up the crime scene. Osborne and Evesham, of New Tredegar, Gwent, were cleared of murder but convicted of perverting the course justice for cleaning up blood and moving the body. The judge told them: All three of you were seeking to hamper the investigation. Osborne was jailed for two years and four months and Evesham was jailed for three-and-a-half years. In , Gaut was babysitting his girlfriendaposs son Chi Ming Shek - known as Marky Pickthall - when he battered, kicked and burned the sole of the childaposs foot.  The babyaposs mum Jane Pickthall, then , had been out drinking and left Gaut to look after her two young children. She arrived home in Caerphilly, South Wales, and made love to Gaut - but the next day she found her sonaposs dead body under a chest of drawers. A murder trial at Cardf Crown Court heard Gaut tried to make the death look accidental. Miss Pickthall found Marky dead underneath a chest of drawers in his bedroom. The baby died of multiple injuries including a broken arm, injured liver and spleen and a fractured skull.    Gaut was convicted of murder and jailed for le in July  - but was released on parole in November. After the case, Lisa James of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This attack was planned, with David Gaut being lured to his death. “The three men went to considerable s to cover up what had happened. “Evidence presented by the CPS built up a detailed picture of what happened, allowing the jury to reach these verdicts. “Any loss of le is a tragedy and our thoughts are with David’s family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic images reveal terrifying pace","story":"NewsDramatic images reveal the terrying pace Britains coastline is shrinkingIn some parts of the UK more than half a mile has been lost from the coast in the last  yearsShareCommentsByEmilia Bruce-WattJane Lavender:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsSeveral homes have fallen into the sea already in Happisburgh, Norfolk \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailChilling photos have revealed the increasingly rapid pace Britainaposs coastline is shrinking . In some cases the coastline has dropped back by as much as half a mile. Dozens of homes have also been lost as beaches are eroded across the country. One man, photographer Mike Page, has been documenting the dramatic erosion over the last three decades - and his shots show just how serious the situation really is. The -year-oldaposs aerial photos, which show the land along the coast of East Anglia, have even caught the moment some homes fell into the sea.    The images show how Norfolk and Suffolkaposs beaches have shrunk between  and now as chunks of land the size of football fields crumble into the water.  Mike, a retired mechanic, said: Itaposs an ongoing issue and we will see a lot more of this. Iaposve been looking at the erosion for some time now so I knew it would look something like this but it is quite unbelievable - itaposs a lot and itaposs getting worse. There is going to be more land lost. It will just get worse - they are losing areas that they didnapost expect to lose. They didnapost think it would be that quick. They have lost about  houses at Happisburgh and about  houses at Hemsby.    I grew up in the Beccles area and they have lost about half a mile of coast - that has been since I was about  or  years old. I frequented that area often when I was young and everything has gone now. Mike flies above the coastline in a two seater Cessna  and takes the photos with a handheld cannon D and D, observing the erosion from a unique viewpoint. He added: People use drones now to get a view of the coast but they still canapost get the height that we can. It is a serious issue and land owners are spending their own money protecting their land.  The government will not spend the money on it. People are having to spend money on dismantling their own houses. They cannot allow any rubbish to fall into the sea and they are having to pay for that themselves - it is costing people a fortune and is ruining livelihoods. In Hemsby, they lost land over just two or three weeks after a big storm - the coast is made of sand and the erosion happens very, very quickly. The only way to stop it is to get rock barriers at the coastsapos bases. They have done this at some points and it it did stop the erosion for a period of time. If the government spent the money orcommunities could raise the money for the rock barriers, the erosion wouldnapost be as quick - but itaposs hard for them to do that.  This stretch of coast is being allowed to erode under a government policy called “managed realignment”, which allows the shoreline to move naturally. It means communities will be given time to move with some sea defences put in place but ultimately nature will be allowed to take its course. The Norfolk and Suffolk coastline also holds historical signicance and archaeologists treasure these shores. The sandy heathland of Easton Bavents, near Southwold in Suffolk was once England’s most easterly point back in the days when it extended a mile out to sea. Happisburgh, near Norwich, in Norfolk, is the earliest known human settlement in Europe, but a after one million years, humans are now retreating in land.  In , residents of Beach Road in Happisburgh were asked to leave their homes as the waves began to creep ever closer. But campaigner Bryony ­Nierop-Reading, , refused, and moved out three years later - only when her bathroom and bedroom were hanging over the clf edge. The Environment Agency estimates that , properties in Britain will be lost to the sea over the next century. Mike has taken , images in his  years of flying and has captured moments in time that will never be seen again.

Mum-of-one Heather Brough, , had woken her one-year-old baby Lily Higgins from a nap and taken her downstairs when she found three deep apospurple scratchesapos on her cheek. Heather, who lives with her fiance Josh Higgins, , at his mum Krisapos guesthouse claims the unexplained injuries prompted them to check the baby camera to seeshe had scratched herself while sleeping. But when they reviewed the footage, they discovered a male figure briskly walking past Lilyaposs cot before disappearing into thin-air.    The pair are now actively looking for a new home to get away from the aposhauntedapos property - after investigators confirmed the house had aposparanormal activityapos. Kris claimed the former owner of the home was an elderly lady who lay with a broken hip for aposa very long timeapos until she was found dead at the bottom of the stairs. Her brother lived in the guesthouse until his death some years later.    Heather, from Michigan, US, said: This is a spirit - I donapost know what its intentions are but at this point itaposs becoming physically harmful. This has made us want to leave as soon as possible. As soon as possible weaposre out of here. Seeing Lilyaposs face with the scratches was so bizarre and frightening.    There was no explanation as to how that would have happened. It happened within  minutes. Josh changed her quickly, gave her some snacks, ran out to bring the groceries in with me. I went to take her into the kitchen to help put the groceries away and then I saw her face. I was crying aposwhat happened to you apos I grabbed her jacket and ran over to my mother-in-lawaposs house. Nobody knew what happened. We wonderedsheaposd scratched herself, but when we put her hands up to the scratches it did not match up. I think itaposs possible this is the previous tenant.   The creepy sighting on their baby camera is far from the first for Heather, who claims she experienced months of ghostly goings-on. She purports to have heard screaming, stomping and laughing while home alone and was even woken from her sleep by the sound of a male shouting. Heather said: There have been times where me and my fiance would wake up in the morning and I would hear angry male voice - like someone had stubbed their toe. If Iaposm in the shower I hear someone running up and down the steps.  The first couple of times it happened I thought my fiance and his brother were running up and down the stairs for things - but when I opened the door no-one was there. I woke up to get ready for work one morning and it felt like someone was choking me. It shook me to the point where I decided to buy our camera. One time, from dead out of my sleep, I heard this man scream and it scared me. I woke up Josh and said aposdid you hear that apos Heaposd heard nothing. Kris, Heatheraposs mother-in-law, lives in the main house with her husband Jim, and claims they have had paranormal investigators confirm there is ghostly activity in their property. She claims to have no idea what could have caused the incidents in the guesthouse. Kris, from Michigan, US, said: Prior to [watching the footage], my daughter-in-law had brought the baby over. She was crying, very upset, and the baby had scratches on her cheek.    At first I thought, aposwell, sheaposs a baby. Maybe she scratched herself apos But then the next day I looked at it and they were deep - like bluey-purple scratches. They were pretty prominent and thereaposs no way she could do that to herself. Ever since that incident happened, they donapost leave the baby alone in any particular room. They put her to bed and make sure they are upstairs with her. Theyaposre together at all times, except when sheaposs at daycare. Lily now points to corners of the room and babbles, which she hasnapost done before. They moved in November as a short-term stay, but I think whataposs going on over there [with the ghost sighting] has made it even shorter. The century-old house has a twisted past and Kris has now vowed to have the guesthouse investigated too. Kris said: I was told when we bought the houses  years ago the lady who owned the property died in the main house. Itaposs an old farmhouse and according to her niece, who was the beneficiary, she fell down the stairs, broke her hips and laid there for a very long time before she passed away. She said that the guesthouse was built for the ladyaposs brother who was schizophrenic. He has also passed away. I donapost know how or where - but thataposs the background I was told. Weaposve had many experiences in our main house. Weaposve had an investigator twice and both times theyaposve found evidence of a presence.

Mr Malikaposs we moved their children away and stewards were alerted, who came to escort the still ranting Gallagher out of the stands before handing him over to Merseyside Police . A statement from Mr Malik said: This was my sonaposs first Liverpool game. I have been subject to racist abuse in the past but my children have not.    I felt it is disgusting that a grown man would act in such a way in complete disregard as to the presence of children and their young age. The court heard Gallagher, who has one previous conviction for burglary, was not fit to be interviewed after his arrest due to his drunken state and later told officers he could not remember the incident. Helen Dugdale, defending, said her client could not believe he had used the vile racist language described. She said: The language is not something that is normally in his mind and is not something he uses. He has no explanation to offer to the court today. It is an offence that is totally out of character, one he bitterly regrets and one he has shown remorse for.    Ms Dugdale said Liverpool FC will very likely ban Gallagher from attending any matches. District Judge Richard Clancy said he was not legally able to impose a football banning order because the game was a charity match - but he hit Gallagher with a  month exclusion order banning him from coming within a mile of Anfield Football Stadium. Judge Clancy said: Mr Gallagher this was a disgraceful incident and one for which you are very lucky not to be going to prison today.  I have taken into account the fact you are working and everything that has been said on your behalf. He sentenced Gallagher to six weeks in prison, suspended for  months, and fined him £. Gallagher was also ordered to pay a £ victim surcharge and £ prosecution costs. The Reds won the match, which raised £million for the Liverpool FC Foundation, - thanks to some late heroics from Steven Gerrard."},{"url":null,"title":"modern british woman more capable","story":"NewsModern British woman more capable than ever to take on these top  DIY tasksMore women than ever before have revealed they are fixing and carrying out decorating tasks themselvesShareCommentsByEmma Elsworthy:,  MAR NewsTodays women tackle signicantly more DIY tasks than their grandmothers, according to research \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailModern women are adept at a string of DIY tasks which their mums would never have tackled, according to research. A poll of , women found  per cent of those aged  to  are happy to change a lightbulb by themselves, while six in  have painted an entire room in the last three years. Today’s women are also more than happy to paint cupboard doors when needed, hang pictures and even mow the lawn. By contrast, their own mums are far less likely to have tried the same tasks, while their grandmothers would certainly have left these ‘blue jobs’ to the man of the house. The research was conducted by Yale, in conjunction with their ‘Spring into Action’ campaign which offers tips and advice for those wanting to make a change to their homes during the peak DIY season.    Stephen Roberts, marketing manager for Yale said: “Looking at the stats between the age groups, it is clear to see women today are far more hands on than their mothers and grandmothers ever were. “And although not all women feel one hundred per cent comfortable tackling skilled DIY tasks, they are far more likely to give it a go than previous generations. “Surprisingly, many younger women don’t remember their grandmothers even going as far as unclogging a toilet or planting a tree.” The study found almost half of today’s women are happy to assemble furniture, compared to just  per cent of their mums, and seven per cent of their grandmothers. Four in  young females are comfortable hanging blinds or curtains, in contrast to just  per cent of grandparents.  And while replacing door knobs is easy for a third of ladies today, only  per cent of their mums and eight per cent of grandmothers would have given the same job a try. The only areas of DIY where previous generations excel are hanging wallpapers, fixing wallpaper seams – possibly due to the trend in painted walls these days - and changing a fuse. Interestingly, the OnePoll study indicated that while women are proficient at a host of DIY tasks, fitting an alarm to the house isn’t one of them. Just one in  women claim this is a task they’d feel comfortable doing, with just  per cent of women accepting responsibility for their own home’s security. Roberts added: “The findings regarding home security came as somewhat of a shock – particularly as women are willing and able to tackle numerous other jobs around the home. “For some reason home security is still considered to be a blue job, and yet fitting security products is easier than ever thanks to wireless systems and app-controlled technology.”    Researchers also found  per cent of those polled are confident tackling DIY tasks around the home – and only six per cent would avoid the DIY altogether. Just one in  women of today agree that some DIY jobs are for men and some are for women – believing tasks such as fixing a toilet, fitting an alarm and re-tiling a roof should be taken on by the man of the house. Six in  believe choosing curtains should be a job firmly left to women, while  per cent prefer to be the ones to pick the carpets and the same percentage think ladies should be in charge of planting flowers in the garden. Women of today feel more able to take on DIY projects than generations before them as there are more online guides to helpand there are YouTube tutorials which didn’t exist years ago .

Seren Gomez said she was left disgusted after finally investigating the putrid stench and finding a rotting rat carcass behind a  as her flat became infested with flies. Initially, the foul odour smelled like dirty water and a food bin, but it gradually got worse, the -year-old Liverpool John Moores University student said. Ms Gomez, from South Wales, told the Liverpool Echo that the smell was so bad that she wouldnapost bring anyone into her £-a-week deluxe studio apartment because she was too embarrassed.    A few weeks after she moved in last September, she said, the flat began to smell like there was something dead inside it. Ms Gomez, who is studying a masters degree in forensic bioscience, said: The smell just kept getting worse and worse. At first it smelled like dirty water, then it was like a food bin. I couldnapost bring anyone to the studio because the smell was so bad, it was embarrassing.    I had to light candles and incense burners to try and mask the smell. I study decomposition as part of my masters so I know what it smells like. People thought I was crazy because I would say aposit smells like there is something dead in my houseapos. Ms Gomez said she complained about the stench to Trophy Homes, contractors employed by the propertyaposs owners. She said she sent footage which showed flies and captured the sound of rats in the walls.  When a maintenance worker arrived to change a lightbulb she asked him to remove the shower . They found a rotting rat carcass, Ms Gomez said. She added: I didnapost want to take the  off myself because it would be classed as damage to the property. So I asked the maintenance man to do it and just said aposI think there is something dead under thereapos. And when he took it off - there was a dead rat and the smell was absolutely awful.  At that point I was actually happy that there was something there, because I had been saying it for so long. Ms Gomez said the situation affected her mental health and she almost dropped out of her masters to move back home. She said: I would expect thisI was paying £ a week but I am paying almost £ to live in a deluxe studio. A spokesperson for Trophy Homes said: “We were asked by the landlord to attend the property and investigate what had been reported as a drainage problem. “We did all we could to find the root of the issue, particularly as this is a new build property and the tenant is the first resident. “Both specialist drainage and pest control contractors visited the property on separate occasions and were unable to pin-point the underlying cause.  Meanwhile we also worked closely with Liverpool Student Homes as we sought a swt resolution. “When the rodent was eventually recovered by our own contractor it was removed and dealt with immediately.  “We understand the landlord has since offered to move the tenant immediately to another studio - an offer which has been declined.” How to get rid of rats  The common, brown or Norway rat, also known as the sewer rat, is prevalent across the whole of the UK, says the British Pest Control Association . They often weigh over half a kilo and measure about cm inwithout counting the tail. Each female may produce from three to  litters of between six and eight young in a year, the BPCA says. The rats can cause signicant damage to woodwork, plastic, bricks and lead pipes in homes, and strip insulation from electrical cables, increasing the risk of a fire.  And they carry many nasty diseases - including leptospirosis or Weilaposs disease, salmonella, listeria, toxoplasma gondii and hantavirus - which can spread to humans. To prevent an infestation, property owners should seal gaps around pipes and under sheds, remove potential nesting sites by keeping yards and gardens clean and tidy, keep drain inspection covers in a good state of repair, and cover household waste and compost bins. To get rid of rats, the BPCA suggests contacting a professional pest control company which has access to rodenticides not available to the public. For those who decide to carry out the work themselves, poisons and traps can be purchased from hardware stores or garden centres. The BPCA warns: When placing poison or traps, make sure they are in a safe and secure place out of reach of children and pets. When using rodenticides always follow the instructions on the label, and importantly search for and dispose of any dead rodents in a safe manner.

Research found the average adult spends more than -and-a-half days per yearstressed. And the worries caused by work and personal le mean Brits struggle to sleep six nights each month. But despite trying to have a good work-le balance, the study found we can only manage to find  minutes per day to relax. This is according to a study of , adults by Hyundai, which looked at the dream destinations for getting in the car and unwinding following the launch of its new i Fastback N.     The most popular country is Scotland, and in particular the Highlands, which is famous for its dramatic landscapes and quiet winding roads like the A and A. Scotland topped the list ahead of arguably the world’s best-known road, Route  in the USA. Other desirable locations included the Lake District, North Wales, Cornwall, Australia, New Zealand and the Calornia coastline. Psychologist Dr Becky Spelman said: “Our modern world offers more opportunities than ever before in many ways, but at the same time, people are also more stressed than ever before. Research shows that having access to nature is a real way to unwind and destress, but many of us live in heavily built-up urban areas with little access to nature beyond a shuffle around our local town park, which is often not exactly an oasis of peace, with dogs and footballs flying in all directions.  “Your car becomes not just a mode of transport, but a gateway to another world, in which your everyday worries and concerns are far behind you. “Scotland has been voted the top destination for a relaxing drive, but evenyou are not lucky enough to live in Scotland, our green and pleasant land offers plenty of choices for anyone who wants to regroup and destress away from the hustle and bustle of their everyday le.” The study, carried out by OnePoll for Hyundai, revealed a bad nightaposs sleep was most likely to stress people out, followed by money concerns and running late. It has also emerged that Brits are twice as likely to fall out with their partners than colleagues when stressed.    Just  per cent of adults never worry about their job outside of work, with figures falling to just ten per cent for those aged  and younger. And more than half of people polled admitted that over the past year the pressures of daily le have left them needing a break.Social media is also affecting the younger generation, with almost  per cent of under s admitting the likes of Facebook and Twitter had made their lives more stressful. This figure fell to just  per cent for over s.Women lead a more stressful le, spending  minutes per day stressed compared to  minutes for men.    It is adults aged - who are the most stressed demographic, struggling to sleep eight nights per month and spending  minutes per day worried or wound up. The most popular thing to do when stressed is to watch TV, followed by listening to music and going for a walk. Adults also try to unwind by spending time on their own, going for a run, mowing the lawn and getting behind the wheel of a car for a relaxing drive. Hyundai is encouraging Brits to enjoy some ‘time out’ by driving to one of their favourite places with friends or family – or to simply have some alone time.    A spokesperson for Hyundai UK said: “Despite being given the choice of anywhere in the world, Brits have chosen the glorious Scottish landscape as their number one location for a relaxing drive. “You can’t blame them - with dozens of quiet road which meander through the dramatic scenery, it is the perfect location to visit and unwind.” Engineers from Hyundai developed the i Fastback N to be capable on a racetrack as well as comfortable on everyday roads.    At the push of a button, drivers have the choice of five drive modes that change the character of the car and can match their mood: Eco, Normal, Sport, N and N Custom.

And it might be down to a lack of light, leading to low levels of melatonin which disrupts the body clock. Danish researchers who analysed the working lives of more than , expecting women said the dangers of miscarrying dramatically increase the more night shts pregnant women work. According to the study, women who work two or more nights a week are  per cent more likely to suffer a miscarriage the following week and the risk is becomes greater after week eight. Almost , of the women who took part in the survey suffered a miscarriage during the six year period.    Doctor Luise Moelenberg Begtrup, of the Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital in Cophenhagen, said the groundbreaking results is of national importance because  per cent of pregnant women work at least one night sht a month. She said: Observational studies indicate an association between working nights and miscarriage, but inaccurate exposure assessment precludes causal inference. Using payroll data with exact and prospective measurement of night work, the objective was to investigate whether working night shts during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage. This may be explained by the decline in the proportion of chromosomally abnormal foetuses with gestational age. This makes an association with environmental exposure more easily detectable among later miscarriages. The results could have implications for national occupational health regulations.    The researchers observed the working lives of , women from five dferent regions across a six year period. Almost half of the women worked nine night shts throughout their pregnancy and eight per cent of the thousands surveyed suffered a miscarriage. The report published in journal, Occupational  Environmental Medicine focused on Danish women working in the public sector including hospitals. It is the first to analyse womenaposs payroll data and assess how risk of miscarriage increases over time. Scientists linked payroll data to national registers on birth and hospital admissions for miscarriage to determine how the risk of miscarriage between weeks four to  of pregnancy was influenced by night work. After week eight of pregnancy, pregnant women who worked two or more night shts the previous week had a  per cent higher risk of miscarriage compared to women who did not work any night shts that week. It was also discovered that the risk of miscarriage increased the more night shts worked and how regular women worked nights. Researchers are yet to determine a direct cause of the link but they suspect women being exposed to light during the night time could be a contributing factor. Light exposure during the night can disrupt a womanaposs circadian rhythm which decreases the release of melatonin - a hormone that preserves theof the placenta and is crucial in securing a successful pregnancy.    Dr Moelenberg Begtrup said: Studies in humans have found lower levels of melatonin mediated by exposure to light-at-night and with no full catch-up during the day among night workers. Melatonin is primarily synthesised in the pineal gland but also in peripheral organs such as the placenta and oies. It plays a role in preserving the optimalof the placenta and experimental studies have demonstrated the importance of tightly regulated circadian rhythms, in which melatonin also has a pivotal role, in the maintenance of successful pregnancies. The study corroborates earlier findings that night work during pregnancy may confer an increased risk of miscarriage and it indicates a lowest observed threshold level of two night shts per week. The new knowledge has relevance for working pregnant women as well as their employers, physicians and midwes. Moreover, the results could have implications for national occupational health regulations.

We based it on the fact he was coming back from a serious injury and he had to go and play games. He has seen the benefit of that. For me, he is still our player.”McInnes is also delighted with the form of Anderson.“Wee Bruce is on fire. His report last week against Alloa was that he didn’t do a lot in the game but he took his goal brilliantly,” he said.“Since Bruce has gone down there, Dunfermline have gone right up.”McInnes or one of his staff will be in the stand at Tannadice tomorrow as Reynolds leads United out for their Championship clash with Alloa Athletic."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.34321734-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.34321734-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.34321734-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.34321734-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"arran man to stand trial accused of bust up at dundee casino","story":"An Arran man appeared at Dundee Sherf Court after an alleged bust-up at the city’s Grosvenor Casino.Craig Sillars, , was charged with behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, shouting, swearing and making abusive remarks which were racially motivated.The incident was said to have happened on September  last year at the West Marketgait night spot.Sillars pleaded not guilty and trial was set for June ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

Tillydrone.It is hoped the Community Management Groupwill be made up of residents who represent ious organisations, including Tillydrone Community Council, the Tilly Network and Aberdeen Lads Club.In the lead-up to the opening of the campus, the CMG will help the council communities team to decide on policies to be implemented at the facility, as well as decide where services will go in the building.Drop-in sessions will be held for people to learn more about what they can do.The events will be held at St George’s Church on Hayton Road in Tillydrone on Tuesday between .am and .am and Wednesday between .pm and pm.Those attending will be able to meet council officers involved in the project, as well as visit the site of the campus.A subsequent event will be held on Saturday between .am and .pm at the church, where members of the group will consider management structures and create a mission statement.Aberdeen City Council regeneration spokesman Gordon Graham said: “We are at an exciting stage of the Tillydrone Community Campus where we’re looking at local people, volunteers and businesses to spearhead the project for the next few years.”Ultimately, it is hoped the CMG can be supported by council staff to develop a business case, which will see the group eventually take over the lease of the hub.As part of a wider three-year plan, the CMG will form a Scottish Charitable

councillors met to agree its budget earlier this month.One of the savings agreed by the Labour, Conservative and Independent-led administration involved saving £, by adopting a “hub” model for school technicians, administration staff and librarians.But Alex Nicoll, the SNP group’s resources spokesman, has demanded clarity over the proposals and assurances the move won’t lead to any job losses.He

entirely unclear as to how the administration expect to make such a huge saving without impacting on jobs or making substantial changes to terms and conditions. There is a complete lack of clarity on this matter and there is no doubt that this will be a cause of real concern for the staff themselves – and that is completely unacceptable.“Technicians and librarians play a vital role in our schools and the administration must provide clear answers to explain their entirely unnecessary decision.”Council leaders described the budget as the “worst this city has ever seen” when it was approved, with a raft of savings agreed to help plug the gap, along with increases to charges including council tax, which increased by .%.However, the administration has maintained that jobs are safe and has said it remains committed to its policy of no-compulsory redundancies.Douglas Lumsden, co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said: “As always the SNP do not like change however this administration recognises that to make the city council governance stronger and fitter for purpose we must work with officers and the trade unions to manage and mitigate change and this saving offers that opportunity.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.30966820-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.30966820-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.30966820-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/03/2.30966820-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dons legend joe harper in hot seat for new chat show event","story":"Aberdeen FC legend Joe Harper will be the first guest of a new chat show-style event in a north-east bar.The event, called A Night With, will take place this Thursday at the Tolbooth Bar in Ellon.Organisers hope to run the event every month and to bring celebrities from the north-east to Ellon to answer audience questions.Martin Smith, the owner of the Tolbooth, said: “At a time when people like to debate, it seems appropriate to give members of the public the opportunity to meet in a social setting and chat with personalities from the north-east.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"what a week of music","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Music Festival drew to a close in fine style at Lochgilphead Joint Campus after a stunning week of performances and entertainment.The th anniversary festival has to go down as one of the most successful, featuring a record entry of competitors.The sun, at long last, shone on the closing day of the event on Saturday March  after a wet, dreich week.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields public need say","story":"NewsBob Shields: Public need say on Prime Ministers Brexit dealReal democracy is having a second voteShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsBlundering Theresa May heads the most incompetent Government weve had in living memory \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHow many Members of Parliament does it take to change a light bulb  The answer – of course - is just one. But it takes the other  of them over two and a half years to decide exactly what kind of light bulb they want in its place! In last week’s episode of Commons Comedy Capers, we had the Brexit secretary proposing the Government’s motion . . . then voting against it. Similarly, we had the Chief Whip – whose job is make sure MPs toe the party line – voting against his party line! Last Tuesday MPs rejected Theresa May’s deal, on Wednesday the rejected ‘No Deal’ and on Thursday they rejected sticking to the March  deadline. I watched the creaking, croaking Theresa at Prime Minister’s Questions and it looked like the only thing you could guarantee to be behind May . . . was June! When it comes to Brexit, the House of Commons has now had more votes than most Eurovision Song Contests. And as I write this on a dreary Monday afternoon – it seems certain that another vote is on the way. Theresa May is going to put her ‘deal’ to the Commons for a THIRD time . . . but onlyshe’s confident that she’ll win it! Yes folks – a vote ONLYshe knows she’ll win in advance. How’s that for democracy at work  So - we have a vote . . . another vote . . . and then another vote  Mmm – now where have I heard that before  Ah yes – now I remember - it’s been the Conservative party’s official ‘put down’ of every single request for a second “people’s referendum” on Brexit. It’s a line you can even trace it back to the lips of our very own Member of Parliament, Mr Bill Grant. “We have already had a ‘people’s vote”, he said. “Another vote, assuming it indicated a dferent outcome, would be presumably followed by another vote and another vote, and so on”. What Bill, and the Conservatives, have been telling us for months is that you can’t keep on having a vote until you get the result you want. But meanwhile, the leader of the Conservative party is doing exactly that! And it’s not asthe Prime Minister needs a five per cent swing – the dference in the Euro referendum – to get her own way. It beggars belief that she can take the biggest parliamentary hiding in history . . .and go back for a second and even a third bite at the cherry! It begs the obvious question –our MPs can get three chances to vote on the biggest political issue of our generation – why can’t the ‘people’ get at least a second vote  I’m also getting fed up with Brexiteers telling us “the public just want this pushed over theline so they can move on”.Er . . . no. The public I speak to want the right deal to leave Europe. Andit’s not on the table, theywant the right to reject it and stay in Europe. Is it too late to ask Bill Grant to stop puckering in the direction of Theresa May and start pointing his ears in the direction of his constituency, which not only voted to “remain” but voted him to Parliament to represent them  I hope not. Bill’s qualities might include loyalty . . . but he’s always open minded. My solution  Well, it might be a bit simplistic – but then most solutions are.  Parliament instructs the PM to ask to delay Article  for one year.  Parliament instructs the PM to form a cross-party Brexit Committee to begin new talks – and come back with the best deal that the combined parties have negotiated and will have support in Parliament.  Give the public an unbiased and detailed explanation of what the deal means. Put it to a referendum – accept the deal and leave – or reject the deal and remain. This way, the people of Britain - and Europe - will know exactly where they stand.By March   – we’re in or we’re out. And everyone, on every side, will have had their say. Bill, that’s real democracy at work.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnConservative PartyAyrBrexit"},{"url":null,"title":"gran who hurled bleach over","story":"Picture by contracted freelance Steve McKendrick\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gran who hurled bleach over a child has been granted a personal licence to sell alcohol by East Ayrshire council. Mary McLelland was convicted of throwing the cleaning agent over a -year-old boy’s head and body in Auchinleck. Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it. Councillor Cook said he would grant the licence “albeit with reservations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilCourtsJusticeAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"people say future high rise","story":"NewsPeople to have their say on the future of high-rise flats in AyrTenants asked for their preferred optionShareByGary Fanning:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTenants in the Riverside Place multi-storey flats in Ayr are getting the chance to have their say on the future of the high-rise properties as South Ayrshire Council’s consultation on ‘Your place, your future’ gets underway. The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"council-delays-decision-on-innerleithen-house-proposal","story":"COUNCILLORS have delayed a decision on an Innerleithen manrsquos bid to build a house on one of the townrsquos many green spaces.Raymond Keddie, of Damside, Innerleithen, has previously had his initial plans to build a house on the corner of Maxwell Street and Damside refused by Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning department, but has now appealed to the local authorityrsquos local review body for a second hearing.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos local review body, which met on Monday, delayed the proposal as they felt they needed more information on the previous use of the land.The plans for the currently empty site have been met with six objections from local residents, who highlight the loss of an historic green space and overdevelopment as chief amongst their concerns.Council officers initially rejected the proposals as they believe the loss of greenspace will have a ldquodetrimental impact on the townscape, and are still recommending the appeal is rejected.In a report to councillors, the councilrsquos planning officer Lucy Hoad writes: ldquoThe local community has raised concerns over the development of the site, regarding it to be an important historic open space contributing to the character and appearance of the Innerleithen conservation area.ldquoThe residents advised that a path used by the public ran diagonally through the site but has since been rerouted around the perimeter.ldquoFurther concerns raised by residents relate to the impact on services and residential amenity.ldquoThe applicant has submitted additional information to contend that outbuildings occupied the application site as some point in the past.ldquoHowever, more recent records indicate that the application site is regarded as being a long established open area that makes a positive contribution to the established character of the conservation area.ldquoThe proposed development at this site would be contrary to the local development plan in that development of this area of green space will have a detrimental impact on the townscape structure of the settlement and the special character and appearance of the conservation area.Mr Keddie has also submitted his own statement to the local review body highlighting the previous use of the land.It reads: ldquoA photo of Damside from circa  shows that prior to the opening of the Maxwell Street school this site had indeed contained a workshop, outbuildings and what looks like a dry stone wall.ldquoMs Hoad, in her report, dismisses this information as being historical, but that more recent records show this is a green space.ldquoI would like this evidence reviewed, as it is evident that this site was never, and never has been, defined a green space, other than it now forms a gap site following the demolition of the buildings to form Maxwell Street.ldquoIt has been stated on previous application refusals and Ms Hoadrsquos report that the land is of great importance to the community.ldquoI refute this statement on the basis that the erection of the fence on this area of land was necessitated by local residents allowing their pets to defecate on this land.ldquoI would propose that turning the site into a residence would be a better use of the space and ultimately better valued.Councillors have now instructed officers to author a detailed report on the historic uses of the land, and whether it qualies as green space under Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning policy.The local review body is due to meet again on April , when the application will be deliberated upon."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet of the Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is Odie.The charity told us: \"Odie is a friendly boy who came in to us as a stray.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 15 2019","story":"Peter Docherty, born and brought up in the Wee Toon, lives in a first floor flat, in Tangy Place tenement, at the end of the High Street, with a #marvellous# view of all the comings and goings on Campbeltown Loch.Back in , aged , he was an apprentice painter and decorator for a town firm, which he thinks might have been Galbraith and Cochrane.Mr Docherty#s son, also Peter, , talked to the Courier on Monday and said: #Dad told me that the young apprentices were always given the awkward, high up places to paint.#Back then this wall must have been under a ceiling as now the graffiti chipped into the plaster is at waist height.#Painters always used to leave their mark on a building, many will be painted over in people#s houses.#They often wonderedtheir #marks# would be uncovered in the future.#On this wall they could see the names of people who had painted it in the past.#When he saw Down Memory Lane last week dad said he was the only P Docherty in the town at the time.#Peter junior, who visits two to three times a year, said: #I was born in Craigard.

which the papers were presented this year which made alternative motions possible.However what did this year yield The main dferences in the budget came down to the administration of the council proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been questioned by its community council which felt that too much had already been spent.The money for Dunoon was because of poor procurement processes and a general #I want syndrome#

Do not just #flick it# into the bushes.In early December, NFUS surveyed farmers, crofters and landowners about the issues they have with irresponsible access, either through livestock worrying by dogs, or the impacts of owners failing to pick up after their pets on or near farmland.The survey had more than  responses, which showed that:  per cent of respondents had an issue with livestock worrying on their land  per cent of survey respondents said they have an issue with dog fouling on their land – this included plastic bag pollution as well as instances where livestock have contracted diseases from eating dog poo and plastic bags  per cent of responses felt the Outdoor Access Code requiring ‘on a lead or under close control’ did not provide sufficient protection to them or their livestock.According to Police Scotland a total of  incidents of livestock worrying were reported in , with  incidents resulting in police conducting investigations. This included sheep, cattle, horses, and other less known species such as llamas and alpacas.However, this issue is still hugely under-reported, something which the campaign seeks to tackle.Andrew McCornick, NFU Scotland president, said: #Spring is a fantastic time on Scotland’s farms and our countryside is blossoming. Farmers and crofters are working around the clock to look after their livestock and deliver lambs and calves.#Attacks on livestock happen all too often in Scotland and we are really pleading with the public to keep their dogs on a lead, avoid fields with livestockpossible and be responsible when walking on farmland.#The industry can no longer tolerate the problem of dog owners who do not control their dogs on farmland.#Many people underestimate the damage dogs can do to livestock – whether that is attacking them when being off a lead or causing them to contract dangerous diseases through their poo – we need dog owners to take responsibility for controlling their dogs whilst out enjoying the countryside.#You think your dog is ‘just playing’ with the sheep but that could change in an instant and you will have no way to stop the dog when it starts to attack.#Make sure your dog is on a lead when walking on farmland – evenyou can’t see livestock they could just be over the hill or hidden in a dip.

Our aim is to unlock those stories and together celebrate some wonderful racing memories.ldquoWe couldnrsquot deliver our work without the support of volunteers and we are always looking for other sports fans who might be interested in supporting the fun and fulfilling activities that take place in our weekly clubs.

Not least to ensure the process of ratication is smoother than that for the withdrawal agreement.ldquoThatrsquos why wersquove committed to give a much stronger and clearer role for this House, and for the other place during the next phase.

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-business-continuing-to-be-conducted-in-private","story":"Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeewas established by East Lothian Council last February after the British Horseracing Authority threatened to pull the coursersquos licence to race over concerns about its governance.Relations between members of predecessor body Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee were described as ldquofestering.It was made up of four East Lothian councillors and three members of Lothians Racing Syndicate , the latter representing racing interests.But the two factions were described in an independent report as having ldquoconsiderable mistrust, weariness, resentment and bitterness.Staff under the previous committee threatened to strike and there were claims of a lack of transparency surrounding their meetings and decisions.The independent report by Pinsent Mason was branded commercially sensitive by East Lothian Council, which refused to publish it until an investigation by the Information Commissioner led to a redacted version being made public.In February last year, the council replaced the old management committee with MRAC, giving the council a - majority over LRS.However, MRAC has held only four public meetings in council chambers in Haddington Town Hall since it was set up, with  of the  items of business on the agenda heard in private.On each occasion, the council has cited Local GovernmentAct , paragraph six, which allows it to exclude the public for ldquoinformation relating to the business affairs of particular persons other than the authority.East Lothian Council said that it ldquolooks to ensure that, as far as possible, committee matters are progressed in public.A spokesperson added: ldquoThe MRAC often considers matters in public session.ldquoAs with other committees, some reports may require to be held in private should they contain exempt information.Reports which have been withheld from the public include the current yearrsquos budget, financial reviews and racecourse general managerrsquos report.East Lothian Council is currently looking for a third-party operator to take over the running of the racecourse, which is on Common Good land.The hunt for a new operator is currently out to tender with hopes an appointment will be made before the end of this year."},{"url":null,"title":"prestonpans-shop-could-feature-on-bbc-show","story":"Corner Shop Cook Off is coming to screens across the country to show off the importance of local convenience stores in Scotland.The new show is presented by actress and musician Clare Grogan, with winner of MasterChef The Professionals Gary Maclean as the resident chef.Each week, a prominent Scottish chef will guest star, going head to head with Gary, only using ingredients from a selected local convenience store from around the country.The Day-Today on Redburn Road in Prestonpans has been selected as a possible store to feature on the show and,it is picked, the BBC portable kitchen will be set up in Prestonpans Town Hall for the event next month.The BBC said that it wanted the local shop owner and the customers to be the judges, adding: ldquoThis means we can really get into the heart of towns all over Scotland and show how essential the local convenience store really isIf confirmed, Corner Shop Cook Off will be filmed on April  and  in Prestonpans Town Hall."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9608980.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uber-acquires-middle-east-competitor-for-23bn","story":"Uber said the deal consists of . billion dollarsin convertible notes and . billion dollarsin cash.The deal will make Careem a wholly-owned subsidiary of Uber, operating as an independent company under the Careem brand and led by its original founders.Dubai-based Careem is among the Middle Eastrsquos most successful start-ups.

Itrsquos also grim that despite the fact one in four voters in Mr Corbynrsquos Islington North constituency have signed the petition to revoke Article , many of their MPrsquos supporters spent the weekend accusing them of being undemocratic.Brexiter Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, evaded questions from journalists about why he is so against giving voters the opportunity to have another say on Brexit, preferring to talk about the impact of austerity on Morecambe, one of the most deprived towns in north-west England.

Jonathon Shafi, the co-founder of the Radical Independence campaign and a columnist in The Herald, described the photograph as sickening and said the SNP would never get his vote again as long as Mrs Sturgeon was leader of the party. Other nationalists made similar comments, although some said the picture was nothing more than a quick selfie and ldquojust a picture. Whatrsquos wrong, they said, with political figures coming together to promote a good cause My answer to that would be ldquonothing but even so, the selfie of the former director of communications for Tony Blair and the current First Minister is still a political curiosity. Take Mr Campbell first. There he was, on the rd of March , enthusiastically taking part in a protest against an unpopular policy, but compare that to the th of February  - the day, you may remember, of the protests against the Iraq War. Writing in his diary that day, Mr Campbell complained about what he called the uncritical coverage of the event. He also said this: ldquoI bumped into no end of people coming back from the march, placards under arms, faces full of self-righteousness.Read more: Independence activist promises never to vote SNP again over Sturgeon pictureSo what, I wonder, was that showing on Mr Campbellrsquos face on Saturday when he posed for the selfie with Nicola Sturgeon: self-righteousness or just a change of heart  And wasnrsquot there also something a bit weird about Mrs Sturgeonrsquos presence  The SNP campaigned languidly at best for Remain and was a late-late-late comer to the campaign for another vote on the EU and yet Mrs Sturgeon spoke asshersquod been a believer all her le. There are also contradictions in the First Ministerrsquos belief in the power of protest ndash several big marches have been held in Scotland in favour of a quick referendum on Scottish independence, but Mrs Sturgeon has been deaf to their calls. Some marches are better than others.For some left-leaning nationalists, the troubling heartening picture of Mrs Sturgeon with Mr Campbell is also symbolic of where shersquos going wrong with the strategy on independence. Instead of being radical and aggressive and anti-establishment, she is being cautious and conservative and is cosying up far too much to the establishment and what they would call the neo-liberal consensus. Their evidence  Item one: the Growth Commission report. Item two: the lack of a second independence referendum. Item three: a picture of Mrs Sturgeon with Tony Blairrsquos right-hand man.I wonder, too, about what  was happening on Saturday: did the First Minister agree to take part in the Peoplersquos Vote march in the pretty certain knowledge that it would not succeed  Because that, sadly, is the fate of most protest marches unless a number of critical factors are in place - which in the case of the Peoplersquos Vote march, they arenrsquot.Firstly, a march or protest has to appeal beyond the marchers and protesters to create any kind of momentum ndash it has to resonate for more than just the core supporters ndash and, despite the hundreds of thousands of people in London at the weekend, the polls show that the wider public is still pretty split on the idea of a second referendum therersquos also no evidence yet of a big enough consensus in Parliament to win a vote. And even all those signatures on the famous petition supporting a second referendum ndash all five million of them ndash will not be enough because five million is not as many as  million, the number who supported Leave.Read more: Nicola Sturgeon: Theresa May already out of powerSecondly, to succeed, a march has to have support from the key political players and again, the Peoplersquos Vote movement doesnrsquot. Itrsquos quite clear that any move for a second referendum in Parliament will not succeed unless it has the full-hearted support of Jeremy Corbyn, but the leader of the Labour party wasnrsquot there on Saturday. You could also argue that the same applies to all those marches in the summer for another Scottish independence referendum ndash until Nicola Sturgeon supports them, they might as well march to Timbuktu.So why do it  Why write your message on the back of a bit of cardboard and march down the street  Partly, itrsquos about the atmosphere ndash therersquos nothing quite as nice as being with lots of people who agree with you, although it can lead to some  assumptions. A lot of people marched for a second referendum on Europe at the weekend, but there isnrsquot a convincing majority for it among the public. Equally, a lot of people have marched for a second referendum on Scottish independence, but a majority of Scots donrsquot want it. But, to the sound of whistles and chants, the marchers make the mistake of overestimating the extent to which their views are shared by others.Where there is hope for marchers of all kinds is in the longer term. The protests in  that Alastair Campbell disliked so much may not have stopped the Iraq War, but they were part of the sht in perceptions that ended Blairrsquos premiership and the same can apply to other protests. Marchers may chant ldquoWe want change. When do we want it  Now but perhaps an immediate change in policy is not the point as a protest can be part of changing public opinion long-term to the point where the government agrees to change or voters change the government.Sadly, the Peoplersquos Vote campaign - despite all the people, despite all the speeches and despite that smiling selfie of Nicola Sturgeon and Alastair Campbell ndash is unlikely to pass this test. Long-term isnrsquot an option for this protest. It simply doesnrsquot have the luxury of time."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-parliament-should-have-role-in-developing-post-eu-laws","story":"MSPs have called for the opportunity to scrutinise and agree on all policy areas, rather than having them ldquoimposed on devolved governments.Holyroodrsquos Finance  Constitution Committee has been examining the issue of ldquocommon frameworks ndash establishing policy and regulatory approaches which are currently controlled by the European Union.:Mike Russell: Brexit should lead to independence for ScotlandThe committee has identied  areas of EU law as falling within the devolved competence of the Scottish Parliament in addition to  reserved areas subject to ongoing discussions between the UK and devolved governments.Finance and Constitution Committee convener Bruce Crawford MSP said: ldquoIf the UK exits from the EU, under whatever terms, common frameworks will be required to deliver common policy and regulatory approaches in some areas currently governed by the EU.ldquoThe parliaments and assemblies of the UK are key to providing transparency, scrutiny and accountability, so wersquore firmly of the view that the Scottish Parliament should have a formal role in relation to the process for developing, agreeing and implementing legislative and non-legislative common frameworks.ldquoWe strongly believe that common frameworks must be arrived at through agreement and not imposed.Scottish Greens constitution spokesman Patrick Harvie MSP said: ldquoIt beggars belief, in the week we were supposed to be leaving the EU, that wersquore still missing vital detail on how things will work between dferent parts of the UKBrexit does go ahead.ldquoOnce again, it shows how the devolved nations have been ignored throughout.ldquoThe report also shines a light on the risks which will comethe Brexiteersrsquo deregulation agenda is inflicted on our social and environmental protections.

That is why legal aid exists.To argue that every penny spent on defending criminals is a penny wasted, is myopic not just because it undermines that fundamental democratic right but because it risks undermining the entire justice system too.:Aaron Campbell sentenced to  yearsNot everyone accused of a crime will turn out to be guilty, but there is no way of knowing that until their trial is over and the money has been spent on their defence. Second guessing that by withholding legal aid from all but those we think or hope are going to end up being exonerated would make a mockery of the justice our court system was designed to deliver. That is also why the cab-rank rule, which compels advocates to take instructions based on their own availability and not on the perceived merits of the case, exists.Liam Kerr may have been right to say the public doesnrsquot like criminals having their defence paid for from the public purse, but is it any wonder when people like him use wilful misrepresentation to influence their thinking  Legal commentator the Secret Barrister has written extensively on the problems created when newspaper reports ldquofoment a public association between lsquolegal aidrsquo, lsquofat cat lawyersrsquo and lsquoundeserving child murderersrsquo. Yet that is exactly what Mr Kerrrsquos words appear to have been designed to do.That is a dangerous road to go down, not least because without those publicly funded lsquofat cat lawyersrsquo to conduct their defence lsquoundeserving child murderersrsquo could well find themselves able to walk free in spite of their guilt being proven. That is why it is in all our interests for the very worst criminals to have access to the very best defence. The alternative - that they are released on a technicality because their trial was deemed to have been an unfair one - does not bear thinking about.There is no doubt that Aaron Campbell, though still a minor himself, is one of the very worst human beings our courts have ever had to deal with. He is, in the words of trial judge Lord Matthews, a ldquocold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous inidual who attempted to play the system by denying his guilt and implicating an entirely innocent party only to admit everything during a post-trial social work report. Damningly, his defence counsel could find no mitigating circumstances to put forward on his behalf.Butwe allow that boyrsquos actions to colour our view of how justice should be served we will all lose out, because an attack on legal aid is an attack on democracy itself."},{"url":null,"title":"art events at heritage centre","story":"The Garioch Heritage Centre will host exhibitors during the North East Open Studios art festival for the first time in September .The decision comes following the hugely successful Gordon Art Exhibition.The Centre will welcome the public to meet the exhibitors and view their works between Tuesday  and Sunday  September.Exhibitors have to complete their applications to NEOS by the end of March.The Centre will also host thw Exclusively Highlands Art, Craft and Food Fair on Saturday  and Sunday  June.A limited number of stalls are still available and can be booked by contacting Exclusively Highlands at info@exclusivelyhighlands.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Council\"  Hotel to host Recruitment and Skills FairviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Catherine with her two dogs Roxy and Riley\"  Award-winning dog first aid courses viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"calling all aberdeenshire residents","story":"Are you interested in how Health and Social Care services are delivered in your area  Have you ever visited a GP  Seen a school nurse or health visitor  Visited a Care Home  Or maybe you care for someone or maybe you, yourself are cared for The chances are that everyone in Aberdeenshire has come into contact with the services that the Aberdeenshire Health and Social Care Partnershipis responsible for delivering.The AHSCP is in the process of developing a Strategic Plan for the next five years and we need your help to do it.

In the s, his predecessors in the conservative government then regarded our fishermen as expendable. It is beginning to look like this government has taken the same attitude towards our farmers.”Responding on behalf of the government parliamentary under-secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, replied: “I disagree entirely. The tarf schedule is designed to protect every sector of the economy including agriculture. He then went on to talk about standards, and we are not dropping standards of what we expect in agricultural goods.”Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The minister can disagree with me all he wants, but he can’t dismiss the views of our farmers and crofters. They know what they are talking about and have genuine concerns about whether food standards will be eroded as a result of cheaper imports. The government must start listening to the experts in this area, and the unions who work on their behalf otherwise we risk undermining an important part of our rural economy.“With only nine days left before we could find ourselves falling into a no deal scenario, the government have got to fix these tarf schedules before they do irreparable damage to our agriculture industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company already struggles to recruit controllers and this is having an impact on services at some airports.“By asking for support from ACAS we hope to find a way forward in these talks. However ministers’ instructions to HIAL severely limit the companies negotiating position, so we also need to see these revoked.”As it stands, controllers at seven of HIAL’s eleven sites, including Kirkwall Airport, are due to take strike action on Friday, April .Industrial action short of a strike was also likely to start in April and continue through until August, and include instruction to work to rosters, refusal of non-medical extensions, an overtime ban, and withdrawal of goodwill.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A public consultation is to follow later this yearThe consultation contains proposals around the use of one of two member wards, where a ward includes an inhabited island — an option made available under new islands legislation — as well as looking at the boundaries of wards.As part of the review, the public#s views will be asked for this summer.Responding to the launch of the consultation, a spokeswoman for Orkney Islands Council explained that, the commission are not recommending changes to the number of councillors but have proposed some changes to ward boundaries. Representatives from the commission are due to come to Orkney next month to discuss the proposals.Speaking yesterday, Ronnie Hinds, chairman of the commission, said: “We are pleased to begin our consultation on electoral arrangements with the three councils today and I look forward to engaging with them on our proposals.#It is important that electoral arrangements for Scottish councils are effective and that our proposals deliver on requirements for electoral parity and, as far as possible, take account of local ties and special geographical considerations.“We also welcome the flexibility offered by the IslandsAct to use one or two member wards and have used this flexibility as appropriate in our proposals. After completion of our consultation with councils we will be seeking public views on our proposals over the summer.”The  Review of Electoral Arrangements will make proposals for the six council areas specied in the IslandsAct  – Argyll and Bute, Highland, North Ayrshire, Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.The commission is conducting the review in two phases, focusing firstly on Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, with the reviews of  Argyll and Bute, Highland and North Ayrshire to take place after the public consultation in the islands groups takes place.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those behind the charity said it is well-known that men find it harder to admit to problems and seek help at an early stage, but the camaraderie of the Men’s Shed is helping to overcome this resistance.Despite the success of Orkney Men’s Shed and the growing popularity of the movement across Scotland, Mr McArthur suggested that they remain a “largely unsung success story”.  The MSP described the work the organisation does as “le-changing” for its members, providing a sense of purpose and an opportunity to make friends and share company.Speaking after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “The Men’s Shed movement has been a tremendous success over recent years with the number of Sheds and ‘Shedders’ across the country continuing to grow. This is illustrated perfectly in Orkney, where the local Men’s Shed is going from strength to strength, with membership up to  and plans for expansion of the shed in Finstown.“Every Men’s Sheds is dferent, of course, but all provide a place to work and relax, pursue hobbies, share skills, have a cuppa and a chat and get practical help with projects. This should not disguise, however, the real impact Men’s Sheds can and do have. Increasingly it is recognised that these facilities make a tangible dference in efforts to tackle loneliness, social isolation and mental ill health.“Last month, I urged the government to look at the case for allowing Men’s Sheds to bid in for health and wider social care funding. This is the approach in Australia, where the movement started, and there are strong arguments for assessingthe same might be done in this country. This could help sustain and expand Men’s Sheds, providing more people in Scotland with the chance to access the many benefits they deliver”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And so when you have a real fear as a horror movie creator director, then you know you have something that you can nurture and exploit for an audience.”Us follows Adelaide Wilsonas she s to her North Carolina home with her husband, Gabeand their two children, Zoraand Jason .Meant to be a dreamy summer getaway, Adelaide starts to feel paranoid that something bad is going to happen to her family. And sure enough, theyfrom the beach one day to find silhouettes of four figures in their driveway.But the creepiest thing  The monsters they’re facing are doppelgangers of themselves.Part of the draw of the role for Mexican-Kenyan Nyong’o, , was that it’s so dferent from anything audiences will have seen her in before.“Jordan was asking me to go to places I’ve never been, and giving me two well-rounded, three-dimensional women to play at complete opposite ends of an argument,” explains the actress, who won an Oscar for her film debut in drama  Years A Slave.“And so to be asked to see something from one perspective and then the next day have to see it from the exact opposite perspective ... I mean, it was an opportunity of a letime.”Us is about a middle-class black family – something we don’t see represented in cinema very much.“I loved how unremarkable it was that they were black,” Nyong’o notes, “because I often feel quite unremarkable I don’t live my le always considering the colour of my skin.“And it was nice to have that – a family that we could project our own understanding of a family on to, no matter what colour our skin is, and that the paradigms to which they were navigating this particular monster had nothing to do with the colour of their skin. Yeah, that’s refreshing.”Duke, , who was born in Trinidad and Tobago, says they are also a family, who are “wrapped in what we would call the American dream, this idea of American normality and class and privilege.“For me, it was a lot of cultures of power privilege, power, luxury. What is it and what’s the cost of that “It’s about the speechless and the people you render invisible in your shadow, who carry the burden of your actions. For me, that really spoke volumes – it really made me question myself and see my experiences of privilege.“I come from a historically oppressed background and I don’t really see my le as one that is privileged, until you put it in the context of people who don’t have as much as you, people who have to suffer to make your le as privileged as it is. So, it really put me into a dferent category of how I see myself.”Star Wars actress Nyong’o, who also appeared alongside Duke in Black Panther, admits she was taken aback by the script when she first read it.She made sure to pick Peele’s brain about the imagery, and the social commentary on the US which is woven into the story, before going on set.And it seems the idea “of recognising the monster in the man in the mirror” is one that has really stayed with her.“There’s a duality in all of us, there’s a darkness that we often suppress and it is in suppressing that side of ourselves that it can become destructive, because we project it out of ourselves and onto other people and onto other things,” she says.“So, especially in this time when people are pointing a lot of fingers to the ‘other’ – the other gender, the other country, the other political faction, the other religion, the other ethnicity – we often fail to recognise the monster in ourselves, and this was a film that was anthropomorphising that monster.”Us is out now in UK cinemas©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dyslexic edinburgh man left stunned by city tram ticket snub","story":"A disabled man has spoken of his dismay, claiming he was discriminated against by a tram conductor who refused his money and left him stranded on a station .Drew Bain has severe dyslexia which means he is unable to read the information on machines in order to purchase a ticket before boarding the tram.As a result the -year-old usually explains his condition to the on-board conductor and hands over the exact change to buy his ticket.But upon his last trip to the airport the Edinburgh man was initially flabbergasted when the member of staff firstly refused his cash on the busy carriage.To make matters worse, she ordered him to leave the tram and while he was struggling at the ticket machine, ran back on the tram before it departed, leaving Drew in disbelief.He told the Evening News: “I can’t read the signs and when the conductor came down she ignored my explanation and said she’s have to charge me extra. Why should I pay more because of my disability  It felt like I was being discriminated against.“She wanted me to go to the machine and I said I’d need accompanying. When my bags were off she just turned around and ran on the tram and it set off. I couldn’t believe what was happening. “It was disgusting. I just stood in shock. I had to ask a stranger for help paying my ticket. I started worrying about meeting someone at the airport and missing my flight.”Drew was finally able to arrive at the airport for his work-related trip to Austria when he decided to call Edinburgh Trams to lodge a complaint, only to discover he was not the first to bring the shocking ordeal to the attention of the firm.He said: “Initially I was absolutely gobsmacked.

The proportion of disadvantaged pupils attending the nation’s best schools stands at around half that of the average school, a report by the Sutton Trust has found. The social mobility charity said the shortfall is “almost entirely” due to the fact that the best ranked schools are located in some of Scotland’s most affluent neighbourhoods.It has proposed sweeping changes to the admissions process which would see a certain number of places allocated randomly through a ballot system. The report found that, while dferent nations across the UK have dferent admissions systems, the proportion of disadvantaged pupils as part of the school rolls is broadly similar. It showed that the social backgrounds of pupils tended to reflect the local area they live in, with around four out of five of the top performing Scottish schools ranked in the  per cent most affluent areas of the country. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said disadvantaged pupils should be given priority status in schools that are oversubscribed. He explained: “Getting a place at a good school is key to getting on in le. Yet the bottom line is that in Britain your chances of doing that depends on your parents’ income and whether they can afford to live in an affluent area.“This is why we want to see more use of ballots – where a proportion of places is allocated randomly – as well as a focus on improving the quality of teaching in all schools, particularly those in the most disadvantaged areas.”The report includes analysis by researchers from the National Foundation for Educational Research charity. Jude Hillary, quantitative research director at the foundation, said: “Our findings show that top performing schools in each nation have much lower rates of disadvantage compared to the average rate nationally. This matters as pupils admitted to these schools achieve the highest attainment outcomes, which enable them to access the best universities and potentially achieve the top labour market outcomes. “In the interests of promoting greater social mobility, more needs to be done in these countries to increase the socio-economic ersity of the intakes of top performing schools.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit mps vote to take control of brexit process","story":"Parliament will move to seize control of the Brexit process after MPs voted to take over the Commons order paper and give themselves a series of votes on alternative plans to break the deadlock.MPs will on Wednesday to hold a second EU referendum or stop the Brexit process entirely, undermining Theresa May’s authority and posing the most serious threat to government unity since the  referendum.After a previous bid to force ‘indicative votes’ fell by two votes, the government’s defeat was emphatic, losing by  to .The decision puts the Prime Minister on a collision course with parliament after Mrs May said she would not automatically respect the result of any votes on alternative Brexit plans.Her comments prompted anger from opposition figures, who accused her of trying to “ignore parliamentary sovereignty”.The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford told Mrs May in the Commons: “If our votes do not count, then frankly we may as well just go home.”The Prime Minister was forced to admit she did not have the support to get her Brexit deal through the Commons, shelving plans for a third attempt to bring it before MPs this evening.Business Minister Richard Harrington quit to support indicative votes, accusing the government of “playing Russian roulette” with the economy by failing to rule out a no-deal Brexit.

Ministers did not ask Mrs May to stand down, despite growing calls from Brexiteers for the Prime Minsiter to commit to stand before the next stage of negotiations, in exchange for their votes on the deal.Under the terms of an agreement to extend Article  signed off at an EU summit last week, the government now has until Friday to pass its Brexit deal, or risk losing an offer of two extra months to pass vital legislation and crashing out on  April.There are fears the process of indicative votes could be inconclusive.

It is the fact that the referendum might be lost by her argument, therefore she does not want to have it.”The Constitutional relations secretary insisted Brexit had highlighted “the very fragile position of Scottish autonomy and decision making”, with Scots having overwhelmingly voted to stay in the European Union in .While Scots voted by  per cent to  per cent against independence in , Mr Russell stressed that at the time they were voting for a “United Kingdom that was part of the EU, but also a United Kingdom that was characterised repeatedly during the campaign as a union of equals”.He said: “Now the UK is set on leaving the EU against the clear will of the people of Scotland.“That is such an enormous change that it would by itself justy ing to the people of Scotland to reconsider the issue of independence.“And we did set out these exact circumstances very clearly in our manesto for the  Scottish general election.”The SNP won the most seats at Holyrood in that election on a manesto that set out that the Scottish Parliament “should have the right to hold another referendum ...there is a signicant and material change in the circumstances which prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will”, he stated.Mr Russell said: “No matter what the Prime Minister thinks, we have a cast-iron mandate for a further independence referendum on those grounds alone.”He said that was a “mandate supported by a majority in the Scottish Parliament, as the Scottish Greens hold the same view, and a majority of Scottish MPs at Westminster”.Telling the audience he had been “born in that hotbed of Scottish nationalism of Bromley”, Mr Russell said Scotland would continue to have a good relationship with the rest of the UKit became independent.He said: “I am in no doubt the social union will continue and underpin whatever eventual relationship Scotland has with the rest of the UK.“We’re always going to work together, cooperatively and collaboratively.

It’s compulsive. Punters may struggle with the latest twists and turns of the actual Brexit process, but we know where we are with plots, conspiracies, egos, competitors and rivals. So this weekend, that’s what we got.The London-based, Brexit-supporting Sunday press portrayed the Prime Ministerial wrestling match as Game of Thrones minus the hair extensions. Sure, the replacement line-up was underwhelming and the “personalities” either self-indulgent loons or zipped-up bureaucrats. But ramped-up talk of daggers at dawn sells papers and serves to distract from the dangerous vacuum of leadership and national purpose at the centre of British politics. It’s a bit like the vacuous speculation of football punditry. Or sitting at the back of the classroom watching someone  get into trouble. Who doesn’t get caught up in this newspaper-induced frenzy of distraction Yet to be honest, who really cares  Or perhaps more accurately, who thinks the political demise of Theresa May or speculation about her replacements are the most important stories in Britain now  Would a new hand on the tiller change the doomy vibe  True -a Brexiteer captured the top job, Theresa May’s unloved deal might suddenly look palatable to the DUP and ERG, and -- wrappedin some strong-man words about tough negotiating stances on future trade deals - might just stumble through the Commons on a third meaningful vote.Hooray. All that gets us to is the first, small landing on a vertiginous flight of stairs laden with a fudged deal, that’s worse in every respect than full EU membership, except for the fig leaf of political sovereignty it hands to whatever broken Tory leader is around to collect.Still, that prospect remains a long way off. So was talk of succession really the hottest Brexit news of the weekend Or was talk of coups, successors and men in grey suits deliberately spun and timed to obscure the really big stories of the weekend.One – the People’s Vote march with a whopping one to two million participants. Two – the Revoke Article  petition with a very whopping five million plus signatures. Just as Theresa May’s meltdown and car-crash TV address became a real turning point in public, Tory party and EU opinion last week, so the size and energy of the People’s Vote campaign and wider Remain movement this weekend prove the  per cent are back on the front foot – even without support from the leader of the Opposition. That’s quite a feat, and could yet change the dynamics of the remaining Brexit saga. A series of un-whipped indicative votes may be held in the Commons today or tomorrow – a laudable opening up of options. Although Theresa May regularly asserts that Norway Plus and a People’s Vote have already been voted on and rejected by the House, neither were free votes. If Tory MPs had supported a second referendum, the whip would have been withdrawn, effectively expelling them from the party and forcing them to sit meantime as independent MPs. Very few Tory MPs have been brave enough to contemplate that – so far.A free vote could change all that, but is still fraught with dficulty. Since the plodding old House of Commons finds it impossible to use transferable votes even in a crisis situation, the order of voting will be all-important. It’s entirely possible MPs will vote against their second and third preferred options, hoping their favourite outcome wins the backing of the House, only to discover that it fails but there’s no going back to rearrange voting preferences. If such a shambolic but predictable failure to capture real voting intent occurs, MPs could soon be back with the same limited choice that faced them last week – Theresa May’s deal or no deal. Except that now, courtesy of six Scots parliamentarians who’ve demonstrated the capacity to crowd-fund, think ahead, act together and ignore intimidation from all sides, the Commons has another option -- to revoke article , halt the Brexit process, decide what to do politically thereafter and, in all probability, save lives.According to one Scottish MP, a nurse in central Scotland wrote last week “We use so many specialised drugs in paediatrics and we’re breaking our budget hoarding what we can. But drugs have such short shelf lives it’s utterly pointless. We also worry about our incredible specialists and surgeons leaving the country. My job is hard enough, but I might as well become an undertaker at this rate.”If MPs are running out of road to avoid such a crisis by April th, pressing the Revoke button could make a lot of sense. Of course, no-one will ever give due credit to the politicians who made that escape route possible. As Joanna Cherry MPobserved last week “Theresa May has sought to marginalise Scotland throughout the Brexit process, so it’s a rich irony that Scottish Parliamentarians and the Scottish courts have offered the UK the leline it needs to escape the mess she has created.”It’s an irony that won’t be lost on Scots. A Revoke petition signatory said this weekend “Signing was the first time I’ve felt I have a say in what happens since June .” As those who remember the late momentum behind Yes in  can testy, that’s a heady feeling. And once it becomes clear that Revoke doesn’t lessen the chances of a second indyref, numbers signing up are likely to grow. And that’s the real story of the weekend – not blethers about the dissolving grip of Theresa May.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive.

Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues. However, some items such as these documents are too fragile to be on long-term display, so putting them online is a great way to showcase them.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"british airways flight bound for germany lands in edinburgh by mistake","story":"Passengers were stunned when they were greeted with a \"Welcome to Edinburgh\" message after the British Airways flight touched down in the Scottish capital.

The then mayor of Ballymena took great pleasure in launching the service at Leighinmohr House Hotel.Such a service does not exist today, however many would argue there is no need for it as most people have access to a car or indeed online banking, a feat not yet possible in !O’Neill faces protestorsThe then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Terence ONeill faced protesters at Randalstown Orange Hall while he was addressing Bannside constituents.He faced calls inside the meeting, with people shouting: “ONeill wont go!” to which Randalstown Unionist Dr. Bolton Minford responded: “ONeill is here, ONeill isnt going and he wont go!” Meanwhile, a group of ‘extreme Protestants’ in the audience of nearly  people gave the Prime Minister a noisy reception as he spoke to Bannside constituents.

It was an evenly matched contest, Enkalon going ahead before the Amateurs equalised through Ronnie McMurray. But Dromore hearts were broken when, in extra time, Enkalon snatched a decisive goal to win -.The Amateurs, however, were not to be denied the following year, and in the most illustrious season in Dromore’s history, manager Stanley Poots guided the team to a spectacular league and Cochrane Corry Cup double.The key to their success during that   season in league A was, once again, their ability to score goals ... and plenty of them!The Amateurs banged in over  goals on their way to the league title, which was clinched on Monday, May ,  with a - victory over Holywood Town.Forty-eight hours later, on Wednesday, May , , Dromore lted the Cochrane Corry Cup after beating Harland and Wolff Welders - in Comber.The Welders proved formidable opposition with their physical approach and a well-drilled offside trap. “However,” said The Leader, “the superior skill of the Dromore side plus the inidual flair of some of the players proved decisive and left Dromore winners by -.”Stanley Poots’ double-winning squad that season was: Charles Waddell, Walter McVeigh, Davy Evans, Campbell Allen, Derek Corbett, John Lane, David Kernoghan, Jim Gregg, Clford Bingham, Jim Cochrane, Will Gamble, Ronnie McMurray, Colin Shields, Brian Mulholland and Freddie Davidson.The jubilation following their incredible trophy success was tempered somewhat over the summer when it was confirmed that Dromore would not be promoted to the first ision because Mountview Park did not meet the required standard.The Amateurs thereafter flitted between Divisions A and B until  when their application for the newly-created Division C was accepted – the first time Dromore Amateurs Football Club took its place amongst the ranks of intermediate football.In  , the club left the Northern Amateur League and now plays in the Mid-Ulster League."},{"url":null,"title":"ni climbing frames is tops","story":"A cutting-edge business programme designed to support and grow local micro and small sized enterprises has engaged with over  local companies during the last four years and successfully helped create over  jobs across the Borough.The innovative Business Engagement Programme , managed by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, provides tailored mentoring to businesses – with NI Climbing Frames being one such company to avail of this assistance.Based in Banbridge, NI Climbing Frames design, manufacture and install climbing frames for both the private and commercial market.

From pizza to pasta, Italian food is right up there with so many people’s tastebuds.As a lover of all things Italian, I was hugely excited when the Balmoral Hotel recently started their ‘Italian Night’, available every Tuesday night from -pm. I am no stranger to the thriving Black’s Road establishment and given the quality of food available in the Lady Anne Bistro and the conjoining Stix # Stones, the special-themed night attracted me to pay a visit once again to the Balmoral last Tuesday night.As ever, we were greeted by a polite and accommodating member of staff on arrival and shown to our table. I was immediately drawn by the décor – a number of Italian flags scattered around the restaurant and a huge blazing fire which was the perfect welcoming as Storm Gareth continued to rage outside.The themed-menu consists of a range of dishes sought to bring out the authentic taste of Italy and I couldn’t wait to peruse my choices. From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment. Warm and friendly staff, quality food and best of all, it’s right on your doorstep. I could not recommend the Italian night anymore. Go and check it out for yourself and tell me you don’t feel like you have been to Italy for the night. I cannot wait to plan my next Tuesday nightvisit.Balmoral Hotel,Blacks Road, Dunmurry, Belfast BT NFTel:    balmoralhotelbelfast.co.u"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"butsy was larger than life and loved by many","story":"BORN on September   the late Pat ‘Butsy’ Butler has been described as a “larger than le figure” and“someone who was known and loved by many”.Pat, who passed away on December  , was educated at St Teresa’s Primary School on the Glen Road, before moving to St Malachy’s College where he completed his secondary education. The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of tragic niall donate 12000","story":"FAMILY and friends of a Glengormley teenager who died tragically after suffering heart failure on a Belfast party bike have donated £, to the Royal Victoria Hospital Intensive Care Unit.-year-old Niall Lyttle injured his head after falling from a -seater Wee Toast Tours bike in the city centre on Friday, November .

The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The airport is to increase the number of security lanes from six to eight by Easter.Belfast International Airport has been approached for comment on the ranking of its lounge.A Which  Inspector was less than impressed with what the airports lounge had to offer.\"We were particularly looking forward to the sumptuous buffet, imagining all sorts of treats that might be available,\" the Inspector said. \"What we found was that the buffets ‘hot selection’ was just a single soup: sweet potato and butternut that was bland. This was accompanied by a pair of poor quality wraps. Sparkling wine and champagne wasnt included and there was a drinks limit. \"The wi was the standard free wi for the airport, rather than a dedicated or faster service for lounge guests.\"The experience was not all bad for the Inspector.\"Staff were friendly and the lounge was spacious and a welcome break from a very hectic airport but very expensive for what you actually get,\" the Inpsector said. \"I’d expect the fee to contribute to a much higher quality of food. You could get the same at Pret for a quarter of the price.\"Belfast International was ranked jointly with London Lutons Aspire- which offered \"congealed eggs\" and \"stale bread rolls\" and London Heathrow Terminal  Aspire.Read MorePassengers voice frustration at security delays as  miss their flights at Belfast InternationalLondon Southend Airports Skyle lounge had no hot food, no runway view and no sparkling wine, earning the facility just one star out of five.Reviews described the lounge as having \"stained carpets\" which were \"dusted with crumbs\", while the food offering was a \"sad-looking buffet\" of \"unripe bananas\" and \"pastries cut into halves\".Access to the lounge costs nearly £ when booked in advance or £ for those paying on the day.The airports website claims the lounge is \"smart and sophisticated\", urging passengers to \"start your journey in real style\".Edinburghs Aspire lounge received the second worst score with just one-and-a-half stars.Although the facility did include a hot food menu, an inspector described a salad as having \"a past-its-best tang\" while a pasta dish \"looked like cat food\".Complimentary sparkling wines and a la carte dishes helped London Heathrow Terminal  No  lounge share first place.It was described by inspectors as the best-equipped facility, boasting a cinema, free showers, private sleep pods and hot food options made to order.Also sharing the top spot were the Manchester Terminal   and London Heathrow Terminal  The House lounges.Which  Travel editor Rory Boland said: \"Battling through security queues and the maze that has become duty-free can be such an ordeal - its no wonder that the promise of an oasis of calm in a pay-to-enter lounge is so appealing.\"But with lounges charging up to £ for what might amount to little more than a seat on a stained sofa and a soggy pastry, passengers might be better off saving their cash to treat themselves once they reach their destination.\"Which  reviewed  pay-as-you-go lounges at nine UK airports between September and December ."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37949270.ece/ca725/BINARY/poster2.jpg","title":"mystery as spoof election posters spotted around belfast but whos behind it","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But I do commit to engaging constructively with this process.\"The successful amendment tabled by Tory former minister Sir Oliver Letwin means MPs will take control of the Commons order paper from pm tomorrow.Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann challenged the DUP to exert greater influence on the Government after the Prime Minister cited Northern Ireland as a reason for delaying Brexit.The DUP accused Mrs May of making \"a threadbare and weak excuse\" for not departing from the EU on March .The party said it was the first time it had heard this argument from the Prime Minister. Blame for any lack of preparation in Northern Ireland for a no-deal Brexit lay solely with her Government, the DUP added.Mrs May earlier told the House of Commons it was necessary to extend the date of the UK leaving the EU because Northern Ireland was unprepared for no deal.With devolution suspended, she said Stormont civil servants didnt have the power to make the necessary decisions.She said a form of direct rule would be needed for Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\"If there is no Stormont government,powers are needed and ministerial direction is needed which is not available to civil servants currently, it would require some direct application of powers here from Westminster,\" she said.Mrs May acknowledged there wasnt currently enough support in the Commons for her to bring back her Brexit deal for a third meaningful vote.But she pledged to continue her efforts to build support for the deal and to stage a vote before the end of the week.In a -minute conversation earlier yesterday with the Prime Minister, DUP leader Arlene Foster repeated her partys opposition to the Withdrawal Agreement. But UUP leader Robin Swann was highly critical of the DUPs Brexit strategy.\"If the DUP are going to continue their confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative Party, then they would need to start having some impact instead of acting as bystanders and wringing their hands when Northern Ireland and our position within the UK are used as a bargaining chip in negotiations,\" he said.\"Their strong words which they trotted out when they signed their pact with the Conservative Party need to be backed up by actions rather than just looking for another pay-out.\"Responding to Mrs Mays statement to MPs, DUP MP Gavin Robinson said: \"We want a sensible deal so we can leave the EU in a structured, orderly way. We will continue to work for a better deal which respects the referendum result and protects the Union.\"While the Prime Minister blames the lack of a Northern Ireland government for being unable to exit the EU on March , this is a threadbare and weak excuse.\"SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said: \"Weve now long since passed the point where any promise of a meaningful decision from this Government became meaningless.\"The problem hasnt changed and neither has the solution. MPs must bank the backstop and support the deal. The political circus has to stop.\"Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said border communities must not become \"collateral damage for British Government policy in Ireland again\".He said: \"Whether the date shts or not, were still a matter of days away from a change in the arrangements that people have become used to over the past  years here.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: \"Something has to give andnot, the UK will stumble into a catastrophic no-deal situation.\"The European Council has set a deadline of Friday for the Prime Minister to secure parliamentary approval for her Withdrawal Agreementthe UK is to leave the EU with a deal on May ."},{"url":null,"title":"mps condemn grand wizards nickname for group of tory brexiteers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is beneficial to remove barriers to learning and help the students become calmer and more focused.Mr Doyle believes it is “totally unacceptable” for anyone to be waiting this long to access vital services, but for young people on the autism spectrum it is “even more outrageous”.He continued: “I know our healthcare staff are doing all they can and deserve all the support we can give them, but our politicians who have abandoned the health service for the last two years must shoulder the blame for these atrocious waiting times.“In the time I have been campaigning I have come across dozens of families who require Occupational Therapy in particular to allow their children to develop and grow in a suitable environment.“I have no intention of letting them wait at the mercy of a political system that has failed us all and will be doing my utmost in the coming weeks as I have been, to lobby health chiefs for more accessible services for families whose loved ones are on the spectrum.”"},{"url":null,"title":"public urged attend information evening gas installation","story":"People are being urged to attend an information evening regarding gas installation in the Shantallow area of Derry.SDLP Councillor is urging residents interested in switching to gas to attend the event being held at tomorrowfrom .pm until . pm.at Pitchers Restaurant and Events Pavillion Alder Road Cllr Dobbinssaid: \"Since the laying of the new gas pipes in the Greater Shantallow area I have been inundated with calls enquiring about gas provision to residents. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Questions regarding associated costs, connection fee, new radiators , boilers etc andfinancial assistance or grants are available and who can avail of this.\"HA, Firmus Energy and Worcester Boilers will be in attendance at this information evening and will provide the opportunity to have these questions answered\" Cllr Dobbins concluded: \"I would urge residents who are interested in switching to gas to drop into the session to get the information of entitlement and charges.\""},{"url":null,"title":"conservative mp for brecon and radnorshire chris davies admits submitting false expenses claims","story":"Brecon and Radnor MP Chris Davies arrives at Westminster Magistrates Court, in ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtLondon.

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit

Since then Exploris curator Peter Williams has kept a watchful eye over the  month-old old turtle.Mr Williams said: ldquoThe loggerhead turtle arrived at Exploris Aquarium in a critical condition from a beach near Rosbeg, Co Donegal.ldquoSince then we have been working tirelessly to slowly raise the turtlersquos temperature by a couple of degrees every day. Our veterinary team also decided to administer a course of antibiotics as an increase in temperature heightened the risk of a secondary infection setting in.He added: ldquoI am now happy to report that JC is making slow but great progress and is feeding well on a iety of fish and invertebrates. He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard. The proposed hotel development also includes plans to upgrade the Inch Abbey Road junction with the Belfast Road.Lidl submitted plans to secure outline planning permission to redevelop the . acre Shanslieve Drive site in January last year.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, had lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners have insisted that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and that there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which could accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.The supermarket giant says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Prenter goals just the ticket  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School produced a sizzling display to get the better of a resolute Cathair Dhoire side in a nailbiting showdown at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Monday.The Red High had to show great fortitude and tenacity in one of the most exciting and entertaining MacLarnon Cup finals in years as the Derry amalgamation threatened to ruin St Patrickrsquos day.The Downpatrick lads werenrsquot found wanting when the chips were down and two goals from man of the match Tim Prenter mdash one in each half mdash was the main dference between the sides.Prenter was a deserved recipient of the award as he continually stalked the Cathair Dhoire defence at every opportunity and had them chasing shadows every time he went near the ball.Loughinislandrsquos Brandon Boyd opened the scoring for the Red High after only  seconds. Club mate Peter McMullan fielded the resultant kick out and released Ronan Connor to make it - to - after less than a minutersquos play.However, Cathair Dhoire started pushing up on the Red High kick-outs and this proved an effective tactic with scores flowing from Cahir McMonagle, Fergal Mortimerand Ben McCarronto take a - to - lead after just five minutes of free-flowing football.It could have been even worse for St Patrickrsquos as Cathair Dhoire wasted two excellent goal chances with superb defending from Bryansfordrsquos Jack Harbinson denying McCarron with a timely block.The Red High started gaining possession in and around the middle of the park, but they definitely missed the ball winning ability of Saulrsquos Ruairi OrsquoHare in this sector, although he did start at full forward.OrsquoHare picked up an injury while playing for the Northern Ireland U- team in a Centenary Shield game against Wales on Thursday night, but his switch to leading his sidersquos attack worked a treat.With seven minutes of non-stop football gone Prenter, a senior county hurler, left three defenders trailing in his wake as he cut through the Cathair Dhoire cover before drilling the ball low and hard into the bottom corner of the net.Not a bad goal considering there was absolutely nothing on when the Downpatrick player received the ball out on the left flank.The Red High now had a grip on the game and OrsquoHare plundered the next five points for his side, two from frees, but Cathair Dhoire kept in touch with two points from McCarron, leaving the Downpatrick school with a - to - lead after  minutes.The Derry amalgamation sensed blood and towering midfielder Oran McGrath plucked the ball out of the air and ended a bustling run with an improvised finish to the net.Cathair Dhoire were far from finished and unanswered points from McCarron, McMonagle and Mortimer had the sides level after  minutes with all to play for.It could have been curtains for the Red High at this stage, but lsquokeeper Eoin Maginn saved his sidersquos bacon with two wonderful saves.Ruairi Quinn edged the Red High back in front just minutes after being introduced and the impressive OrsquoHare made it a - to - game  minutes.Prenter then finished Cathair Dhoire off with a second sensational goal. McMullan converted a late free after OrsquoHare had been sent off and McCarron grabbed the last score of the game for a battling Derry side.St Patrickrsquos: E Maginn, J Harbinson, E Rooney, L Guiness, P McMullan, R Murphy, B Boyd , C Watson, R OrsquoHare , T Smyth , O Cunningham, N Laverty, T Prenter , R Connor , T Savage.

In , the estimated maintenance backlog was approximately £ million.“The department’s current estimation of the backlog is £. billion.”Mr Donnelly said: “It is clear from this report that short-term, inadequate funding of road maintenance expenditure is causing the serious deterioration of a key public asset. “The securing of a long-term funding option needs to be a priority. “One of the surprising findings within the report is the absence of a roads maintenance strategy to demonstrate long-term development and maintenance requirements of the network.”The report also outlines how, due to the lack of cash, roads maintenance has been focused mostly on motorways and the other important routes.Known as the ‘trunk road network’, the audit report finds that these roads are in better condition than previously thought.Meanwhile, the condition of the rest of the road network continues to get worse.Mr Donnelly added: “I am also recommending some reconsideration of the way maintenance funding is allocated. “While major roads such as motorways are in better condition than previously thought, minor roads, including much of the rural network, continue to deteriorate.” Company bosses

report also said the public purse isn’t getting value for money due to the “uncertain” way funding for road maintenance is allocated.It looked at ‘structural maintenance’ – road resurfacing and surface dressing, as well as what it called “unplanned, reactive activities” such as patching up defects when they arise.It found that the Department of Infrastructure relies heavily on ‘in-year funding allocations’ to carry out much of the work.At Stormont this happens three times per year – in the June, October, and January monitoring rounds – when the overall budget is shuffled around and ided out where it’s most needed.But, the auditors say, finding the extra cash this way rather than giving the department a larger, more fixed budget to begin with creates “uncertainty” which leads to more cash being spent on “reactive maintenance” such as patching up potholes, rather than “preventative maintenance” such as road resurfacing.The auditors say the preventative maintenance provides better “value for money” in the long term.“Over time, these funding pressures have constrained spending on good, value for money preventative maintenance,” the report states.In a statement, the Department for Infrastructure welcomed the Audit Office report and said it was considering the recommendations outlined and what measures can be put in place to address the issues raised.try catch

The discussion was respectful, informative and challenging. At the event, I stated that we had a duty of candour to each other. A duty to be truthful with each other, to listen and not misrepresent each other. I made clear my belief that ending partition and unity is the future and in best interests of all our people. I have never tried to mislead or mask that belief. I am, after all, the leader of Sinn Féin.I am known for my straight talking. I do not hide behind ambiguity. I believe that reconciliation requires us to be honest and to listen as equals. Not to second guess, search for hidden meanings or put words in each other’s mouths. I have no problem with others objecting to my views.But I am concerned when my views are misrepresented, as that poisons the political process and undermines reconciliation. The St Patrick’s Day banner is quite clear. It is about ending partition and the interference of a parliament in London in the affairs of the people who share this island. An approach made more evident given the current Brexit shambles.The words on the banner are clear. They are unambiguous and should not be misrepresented. It is about England and its claim to any part of this island. It is an Irish republican analysis and aspiration shared by many at home and abroad. The banner echoes the words of United Irelander and one of the founders of modern Irish Republicanism, Theobald Wolfe Tone, who sought to unite Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter to “break the connection with England”.The banner does not say “English out of Ireland”. I would never stand behind any such banner and those sentiments have no place in our society, never mind a parade. PM hasn’t flinched, despite vicious hostility towards her Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In my speech at Queen’s, that is available online, I made clear that a new and united Ireland, will and must, be a home for all whether you are British, Irish, both or neither. That rights of citizenship, respect and parity of esteem must be guaranteed for all in a united Ireland. I have no interest in a united Ireland that is not a home to any section of the community. Like you I am dedicated to working for reconciliation and the building of an inclusive community of equal citizens regardless of identity, culture, gender, faith or heritage. The Good Friday Agreement provides for a peaceful and democratic pathway to Irish unity. A united Ireland is not about bolting the North on to the South. It is an opportunity to build a new Ireland and inclusive governance, one in which all citizens will play a central role.

Some of the membership are up in arms. There was an argument about it and it could have a drastic affect on the organisation.“I fully support the move – we are all one society now.” Dr Michael Rosie, of the University of Edinburgh, has expressed his surprise at the move, but doesn’t believe it will have much of an impact on the membership.“From what I understand there is a strong majority who said it was time for the ban to go,” he said.Teen whose body was found at Belfast hospital is namedTara Wright’s parents tell of devastation at loss of their ‘kind, funny, charismatic’ daughter Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I thought it would take a generational change but clearly this has already happened.”Dr Rosie said many people were uncomfortable with a rule seen as promoting an anti-Catholic message rather than a pro-Protestant one.“There will be many members, perhaps the more traditional, who will not be comfortable,” he said.“I think it is a good move, a sensible move, but there will be traditionalists who will remain suspicious,” Dr Rosie added.In  the Fermanagh branch of the order published the results on an internal survey which showed .% of members in favour of lting the ban, with .% against and % having no strong opinion.A spokesman for the Scottish grand lodge said: “We don’t discuss our internal affairs with the media.”A Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland spokesman declined to comment on whether they had any plans to propose a similar rule change.He said: “This is a matter for the Grand Lodge of Scotland. We have no further comment to make.”try catch  TrendingGreenvale Hotel owner Michael McElhatton: Police have blackened my name over  drugs claimHotel owner arrested over St Patricks Day disco deathsTeen whose body was found at Belfast hospital is namedOwner of Saint Patricks tragedy hotel gave CPR to victims at the sceneTeenage girl found dead beside car in vicinity of Belfast City Hospital*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

He asked her to clary which areas of devolved government present a problem and when will they be resolved.Choosing her words carefully, Mrs May said that the Northern Ireland Civil Service – who have been running Stormont without democratic oversight for two years – “do not have the powers to take the necessary decisions that would be needed in a circumstance in which the UK left the EU with no deal.“Now, it is possible to address those issues. But that had not been done by the th of March, [sic] the question about the impact on Northern Ireland and where there was no devolved government was an important one and I believe that it’s absolutely right that the government took the view, the government took the view that it was not appropriate, not appropriate to allow that no-deal to go ahead at a time when the powers were not in place to proper exercise of the decision-making necessary in a no-deal situation.”Mrs May’s comments came after she decided to pull a third vote on her deal to leave the EU. The Prime Minister did so after a midday phone call with DUP leader Arlene Foster which made clear that the DUP would not be changing its opposition to the deal.Mr Dodds put it to Mrs Maythat she had known “for some considerable time” that March was Brexit day. He asked pointedly: “So why haven’t appropriate preparations been made  Why do we need another two weeks  What’s going to happen in another two weeks that couldn’t have happened up to now  I mean, this is a fundamental lack of preparation and the government is entirely responsible for thatthat’s the case.”He said it was “an entirely new argument that we’re hearing for the first time, as to why we need the extension”.Mrs May insisted that the issue had been raised by Michael Gove in a recent debate about no-deal, although his comments related to the possibility of direct rule in Northern Ireland to go alongside a no-deal situation.Sammy Wilson said that until now everyone had been told by the government that it was the possibility of a hard Irish border and a threat to peace in Northern Ireland which was driving the government’s approach to Brexit.

Jabbing his finger at the Prime Minister, he asked: “When are you going to stop Northern Ireland as an excuse, and do you realise that the importance of this agreement to delivering Brexit and also to the unity of the United Kingdom is such that we will not be used in any scare tactics to push this through ”Mrs May said that she had “genuinely” been trying to ensure that the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland were respected and Northern Ireland’s place within the UK was respected. She played down the signicance of promises from the Taoiseach that there would be no hard border, saying that they had been “contradicted” by the EU.And Mrs May said thatthe UK was to leave without a deal that would necessitate “some form” of direct rule.Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne asked whether -it was necessary for Northern Ireland to have rule from London in order to prepare for no-deal - there was a plan “to deal with that in good time for the th of April”.

But the consultants draft stage  report clearly states what weve all known for many years ndash which is that a by-pass must be part of any solution.\"There have been those who claim the Welsh Government dont have the funds for a bypass road.

The Caernarfon by-pass cost could spiral from the original pound. million to pound. million.\"Work towards a positive outcome is further forward than at any time since it was first mooted over  years ago.\"There are a number of other steps still to be taken before the cabinet will eventually decide which by-pass route option and other measures should be surveyed and designed in detail in stage .The council has promised a public consultation of the proposals in the future, giving everyone the opportunity to discuss and comment on the project with officials and consultants. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I recognise that there are a number of local and national groups advocating the introduction of such limits on a signicant scale across the Vale of Glamorgan, a number of whom I have personally met, however I am also aware that there are many residents in the Vale who are opposed to the concept.ldquoChanging the minimum speeds in many areas of the Vale from mph to mph as is being suggested by some groups, represents a major decision for this council and one which I feel requires input and guidance from our government due to the lack of evidence available of their success to date, the juxtaposition of our residents, the cost of their introduction, which is estimated at poundk for this council, and the fact that this is a Wales, or even, a UK wide issue.Cardf is the only council to introduce the reduced speed limit in most of its residential streets, compared with more than  in England.Anthony Slaughter, one of the founders of the lsquorsquos Plenty for Penarthrsquo campaign said: ldquoIt is disappointing to see the Vale council avoiding a decision on this vital issue. A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

I recognise that there are a number of local and national groups advocating the introduction of such limits on a signicant scale across the Vale of Glamorgan, a number of whom I have personally met, however I am also aware that there are many residents in the Vale who are opposed to the concept.ldquoChanging the minimum speeds in many areas of the Vale from mph to mph as is being suggested by some groups, represents a major decision for this council and one which I feel requires input and guidance from our government due to the lack of evidence available of their success to date, the juxtaposition of our residents, the cost of their introduction, which is estimated at poundk for this council, and the fact that this is a Wales, or even, a UK wide issue.Cardf is the only council to introduce the reduced speed limit in most of its residential streets, compared with more than  in England.Anthony Slaughter, one of the founders of the lsquorsquos Plenty for Penarthrsquo campaign said: ldquoIt is disappointing to see the Vale council avoiding a decision on this vital issue. A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

Improvements to public transport and cycling and walking routes are also being considered.The council says it needs to engage with Network Rail to understand the potential costs around building the bypass near a railway tunnel, model improvements to the Merrie Harrier junction, and undertake a public consultation.The council is asking the Welsh Government for pound, to complete theWelltag outline business case butthat funding isnrsquot given the authority would find the money.Emma Reed, the councilrsquos head of neighbourhood services and transport, said at a council meeting on March  that a -week consultation could be launched before the summer break in August.Mrs Reed told the Environment and Regeneration Scrutiny Committee: ldquoWe have made great progress on this project over the last couple of years.ldquoWe still need to do this additional work.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They have suggested in the past that it might be birds and in particular swans!

Using state-of-the-art Siemens technology, it will be the most efficient of its kind anywhere in the UK and Ireland. “This is good news as we continue the journey towards decarbonisation and will ensure competitive costs, which will benefit consumers. “At a time of considerable uncertainty, we’re proud to be bringing this level of investment to Belfast, which will result in the creation of over  full-time jobs when construction begins and over  full-time roles when the plant is operational. “DfI has been thoroughly professional in its approach to the application since it was submitted in April .

Which makes it even more impressive that, in that time, he’s also managed to start and scale up one of the great business success stories in Northern Ireland, David Meade Events. Known for his skills as a mentalist and speaker, David also runs the company which delivers cutting-edge corporate events, learning and development workshops, and offers keynote speaking services. It has achieved double figure growth every year since its establishment in  working not only in UK and Irish markets, but also internationally. Asked how he had ersied into events and keynote speaking from being an on-stage mentalist, David says: “I’ve actually been delivering events and keynote speeches very successfully in the UK and Ireland for a number of years, but I suppose most people know me for my tours and the more corporate side of my business was lesser known. “I moved into this space roughly seven years ago because I love inspiring and motivating people and it was a natural move to work with companies who want to inspire their teams to be innovative and the best they can be.” David believes there are even more opportunities outside our region and this year the company is investing over £, to take advantage of them. This includes investing in new video learning services, enabling people to access David’s bespoke training services remotely, from wherever they are in the world. “Over the last number of years, the company has grown at a phenomenal rate and this latest investment was a no-brainer because we simply had to respond to that growth.” David says: “We are still based in Northern Ireland, but there is a huge untapped market that we want to explore further. The world is getting smaller because of technology and we want to meet the challenge and work with people all across the globe. So far in  we have contracts in  countries, including Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland and many more are in the pipeline.” David’s list of international clients reads like a who’s who of the biggest and most impressive organisations in the world including Apple, Hard, Mercedes Benz, Adobe, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, British Airways and Canon. David attributes his company’s success and ability to attract such high-level clients to its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the market. “If the uncertainty of today’s marketplace teaches us anything, it’s that you must evolve and that’s what we’re doing – keeping up with the ever-changing market and meeting the ever-increasing demands, both in Northern Ireland and across the globe.” One of the company’s most exciting innovations has been the development of a bespoke in-house video production studio. This has greatly enhanced its capacity to produce media projects for its clients. Allowing clients to access the bespoke training remotely means the firm can compete all over the globe. This view of the company, as competing on an international stage, is a vital part of David’s approach to business and informs the business decisions he makes, including this recent quarter of a million-pound investment. He explains “The investment in our video learning service means we can deliver training to clients in any corner of the world, at any time. Thinking of ourselves as part of a global economy, rather than just the Northern Ireland economy has been key to shting the company up a gear.” He has grown to a team of  and this year the company is expected to achieve a turnover of £m, an impressive milestone for any company but something David considers not a destination or even a point to slow down, but simply a  to push on to bigger and better things. “As the company continues to thrive and grow every year, I find myself looking at new and innovative ways to keep up with demand. Hitting that £m milestone will be energising and whilst I’m proud of the work my team have done here, I’m already thinking ‘OK, what’s next ’ With this investment, our ability to evolve and the international demand for the services we provide, there’s so much more we can do.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn1.jpg","title":"high street in need of leadership to ensure its future","story":"Posted on Monday  March  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland retailers are increasingly frustrated that a lack of government means key areas of reform aren’t being looked at. John Mulgrew speaks to retail experts about the challenges of the high street If there’s one thing Northern Ireland is good at, it’s kicking the can down the road. Again. And while the ongoing political flux at home is being trumped by Brexit, crucial areas of business reform, especially in regards to the ever-evolving retail landscape, aren’t being addressed.And even since the fundamental review and reform of the business rates system was last discussed On the Hill, Northern Ireland and the wider retail landscape has changed further still – with national retailers going to the wall, or narrowly avoiding going bust.“In  our retail sector is in for its fastest ever period of change and reinvention,” Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI says. “This is equally the case for our high streets and town centres.“This change will not all be good, as we will see some more signicant large retail casualties in . However, we will also see the creation of more confident and dynamic independent retailers, who will be at the forefront of a new retail sector, leading toward st century town high streets.”As for the big names facing tough times, HMV called in the administrators once again, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley – a recent fresh lease with the owners of Belfast’s Victoria Square shopping centre securing the only Northern Ireland outlet’s future for the foreseeable future.“It is nothing less than disgraceful that we start a second New Year with no Government in place in Northern Ireland, with not even a date set for all-party talks,” Glyn says.“This is hugely disruptive for the economy and Northern Ireland is in danger of becoming an international laughing stock.“With much-needed decisions not being made on reform of business rates, infrastructure investment, addressing an ever-growing skills gap and modernisation of our town centres, Northern Ireland is not just lagging behind the rest of the UK and Ireland, it is in real danger of being left behind internationally.”Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says there needs to be a fundamental review of the business rates system.“Retail is % of the economy but pays almost a quarter of rates – that is not tenable,” he says. “The structural change in retail is not reflected in the business rates system and we need to widen the tax base.“Stormont being down is a problem, as it affects decisions on business rates and apprenticeship levy, plus the changing face of retail, and a lack of legislation to protect shop workers from abuse and violence.”Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s councils are raising business rates, from the smallest rise in Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, at .%, to the inflation-busting hike of .% from Derry  Strabane District Council. “There is the very real possibility that they will only find out what the regional rate — and their total rates liability — will be the week before those business rates bills hit their doormats,” Aodhan says.Hospitality Ulster’s Colin Neill says the lack of a Government in Northern Ireland is costing the sector millions and damaging the potential for future growth — sighting the lack of progress to modernise liquor licensing as one of its major contributors to the losses.A Liquor Licensing Bill was one of the few pieces of legislation the Assembly had introduced at that time, but the collapse of Stormont killed the Bill, which set out to address the laws.Overall figures point to a mixed bag for the high streets in general. For example Northern Ireland shops in January defied a UK trend slump to rise by almost %, but shop vacancy rates have crept up to %. gtBelfast itself is still recovering from its high street disaster, following the firm at Primark’s Bank Buildings. That led to a city centre drop in footfall of more than a third, while businesses in and around the cordon felt a more considerable drop.“Consumer behaviour is rapidly changing, and people want something dferent from their high streets and I believe that smaller, more agile and tech-savvy retailers who can adapt to this tidal wave of change, will be the ones who will not just survive, but thrive,” Glyn Roberts says.“Government also needs to reboot its policy agenda for the retail sector and for our town centres to meet the challenges ahead.“While devolution remains in limbo, our eleven councils have been doing their level best to fill the gap and provide leadership, despite not having the full ranges of powers to make the real economic changes within their communities.“Retail NI is an organisation working across all  councils, contributing to each of their consultations on local development plans and assisting our members with planning and town centre regeneration.“Local government elections take place in May and Retail NI has already hit the ground running with the publication of our detailed report, ‘Regeneration NI’, which sets out a comprehensive plan to create st century town and city centres. “The regeneration of our town and city centres needs to be the top priority of our local councils and we will be engaging with them and the political parties ahead of the elections.“The Belfast Region and Derry city deals offer huge opportunities for economic, social and infrastructural regeneration for our two main cities and many of our local towns. It is hoped the Belfast Region City Deal will create up to , new and better jobs, alongside delivering a -year programme of inclusive economic growth – including an increase of £m Gross Value Added .”“ will truly be the year of retail reinvention that will see Northern Ireland’s largest sector of industry, perhaps being slightly smaller but more agile, nevertheless a sector, which is vital to the future of our local economy’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
