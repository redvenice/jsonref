Parliament votes against the deal and also votes to take no-deal off the table then the only option is to then have European parliamentary elections.\u0027Mr Barclay said if the Commons takes control of the order paper and votes for a different outcome, it would \u0027potentially collide with fundamental commitments the Government has given in their manifesto\u0027, though he said the vote itself would \u0027not be binding\u0027.Explaining the scenario, he said: \u0027What Parliament has done is vote for a number of contradictory things so we would need to untangle that but ultimately, at its logical conclusion, the risk of a general election increases because you potentially have a situation where Parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do.\u0027  Hilary Benn, the Labour chairman of the Brexit committee and a supporter o a second referendum, told Ridge: \u0027Whoever is the leader of the Conservative Party, if Parliament decides that it is prepared to support a way forward, and if Parliament decides that it then wants to put that to the British people in a confirmatory referendum, then the nation needs leadership that is prepared to compromise.\u0027That\u0027s the crucial point and the reason Theresa May is in such difficulty this morning is she has steadfastly refused to shift an inch.\u0027\u0027And it\u0027s no

Safiyyah (Saf) Syeed, 18, wants to become the first hijabi boxer to compete in the Olympics         Miss Syeed, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, began boxing a year ago after writing it on her bucket list after recovering from anorexia and bulimiaShe said: \u0027Boxing keeps me sane and keeps me happy, I absolutely love it.\u0027I started just for fun but I\u0027ve really fallen in love with the sport.\u0027I was bit worried at first about being a hijabi girl going into a boxing gym. It\u0027s not what people are used to.\u0027But everyone has been so nice and supportive. No one minds that I wear a hijab in the ring.\u0027It doesn\u0027t affect my boxing at all, some people think it might make it hard to move but I forget I\u0027m even wearing it.\u0027Miss Syeed, who volunteers at a mental health charity, spars with both men and women during training.

The teenager trains twice a week at Lights Out Boxing Academy in Bradford, while studying a leadership program at universityShe said: \u0027I missed going out with my friends and my school prom.\u0027All my friends were getting ready to go to college and move on with their lives and I was in bed.\u0027I decided that two years of being ill was enough.\u0027I wrote a list of things that I wanted to do with my life like start a YouTube channel and go sky ing.\u0027Boxing was on the list and as soon as I felt strong enough I started doing it.\u0027She added: \u0027I want to show people that mental health problems don\u0027t have to hold you back.

Then, to the surprise of friends, in 2009 he married Rose Hanbury, a willowy ex-model, 23 years his junior.They had met at a party at the Villa Cetinale, the grand Italian home of the disgraced Tory peer Lord Lambton — Rose’s sister, Marina, is married to Lambton’s heir Ned, the Earl of Durham.         In 2014 William and Kate decided to move full time to Anmer Hall, the country house close to Sandringham that was given to them by the QueenThe comely sisters, who were once pictured in swimsuits with former prime minister Tony Blair have an impeccable pedigree. Their grandmother was Lady Elizabeth Longman, a bridesmaid at the Queen’s wedding to Prince Philip.The Cholmondeleys’ home is Houghton Hall, a stunning Palladian mansion built in the 1720s for Britain’s first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. The 106-room pile is barely four miles from Anmer and it was soon being reported that the Cholmondeleys with their three children were part of the so-called ‘turnip toffs’, a set of well-born friends of William and Kate with North Norfolk homes.           Among their near neighbours was the Marquess of Cholmondeley, 58, who as Lord Great Chamberlain had a unique role at the State Opening of Parliament (pictured in 2007)— walking backwards in front of the QueenMembers were said to include William and Rosie van Cutsem, the Earl and Countess of Leicester, who live at Holkham Hall and James and Laura Meade, who is a godmother to Prince Louis.One weekend report said the Cholmondeleys’ twin sons, Alexander and Oliver, were playmates of Prince George, despite the four-year age gap between them.Rose and David were both guests (of the Queen) at William and Kate’s wedding in 2011, and three years ago the royal couple attended a black tie gala at Houghton Hall. Rose and Kate, meanwhile are patron and royal patron respectively of the charity East Anglia Children’s Hospices, and the Duchess has attended the Houghton Hall horse trials with her children.William and David would appear to have less in common. The marquess — French-speaking, piano-playing and a lover of modern art — is, after all, the same age as his late mother. The men have been shooting together, but this is normal among landowners in Norfolk.So does all that add up to a close friendship? According to an authoritative family source, the two couples have been to each other’s homes only three times.                William appears to have little in common with the marquess — French-speaking, piano-playing and a lover of modern art — who is, after all, the same age as his late mother. The men have been shooting together, but this is normal among landowners in Norfolk‘They see each other occasionally and like each other,’ a figure close to Rose tells me.‘They are not part of each other’s close circle. It isn’t even remotely a bosom-close friendship.’Nevertheless, tongues started wagging. Last week the Daily Mail did report in its diary gossip that there was competition between the duchess and the marchioness. But Saturday’s Sun newspaper reported that the ‘falling out’ was ‘much worse than first thought’.A source was quoted by the newspaper as saying: ‘They used to be close but that is not the case any more.’ It said William offered to make peace but added: ‘Kate has been clear that she doesn’t want to see them any more and wants William to phase them out, despite their social status.’At first, William and David laughed the rumours off — I am told they even reached the ears of the wider Royal Family. But the latest reporting has changed the atmosphere.I understand both men are baffled by the rumours and insist there is no rift between them or their wives.A family source told me: ‘These hurtful rumours of a fall-out are simply false. William and David were in touch with each other over the weekend, not knowing whether to laugh or complain. Both wives are hurt by the suggestion that there is any argument or even a coolness between them. They have plans for future events involving their charity.‘This is a question of a lie going round the world before the truth has even had time to take its boots off.’ Another family figure said: ‘A whisper which had no basis or truth has turned into a roar.                 William and Kate (pictured at the St Patrick\u0027s Day parade in Hounslow) have not been photographed exchanging so much as a cross word in public. Richard Kay understands that both William and the Marquess of Cholmondeley are baffled by the rumours and insist there is no rift between them or their wivesBoth couples laughed when it was first carelessly put around and endlessly repeated, even though it was patently not true. As more and more people passed it on, it took on a life of its own and has now become hurtful and toxic.’A family friend of Rose said: ‘It has now become very upsetting and they are all concerned for each other, as they have never before had to start denying something for which these is no evidence or even a smidgen of truth. It is just mad.‘David and Rose have been to Sandringham and shot with William and Kate, but they have been to each other’s houses fewer than three times each — some rift!’For William and Kate the developments are especially troubling. They have always been enormously careful about friendships and they have placed a premium on trust. They have eschewed the celebrity friends that Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex appear to like to surround themselves with.No friends of Kate have gone chatting to gossipy magazines as Meghan’s have done to People and Vanity Fair. As a royal wife and mother, Kate has never put a foot wrong, her family are loyal and discreet. She carries out her official duties with enthusiasm.She and William have not been photographed exchanging so much as a cross word in public. But while William has never indulged in the kind of ‘what Meghan wants, Meghan gets’ foot-stamping as Prince Harry is said to have done, he knows how important she is as a mother and a future queen.And if this whole sorry episode turns out to be some cack-handed attempt to dent Kate’s unshakeable standing with the public, it has almost certainly backfired.

Photograph Brian FarrellThe Helen Rochford-Brennan has sticky notes beside every tap in her home with a simple message: do not drink water.She and husband Seán Brennan are among an estimated 14,000 people affected by a boil water notice sparked by cryptosporidium in the Lough Talt water supply, Co Sligo.Because Helen has early onset Alzheimer’s disease she is fearful of forgetting about the restrictions and using contaminated water to brush her teeth or in food preparation.“My husband has a chronic illness so it is really alarming when you consider how dangerous it could be,” she says. “Water is a basic human right and this has been going on for too long.”The Tubbercurry resident chairwoman of the European Working Group for People With Dementia and has addressed the European Parliament on issues facing people with dementia.“I really believe that if it happened on the east coast it would have been sorted out a long time ago,” she says.People in the Lough Talt catchment area – which includes Tubbercurry, Ballymote and a large rural hinterland – have had to boil water for 10 of the past 13 months. The problem is exacerbated because of the conflict between the need for an upgraded water treatment plant and a requirement to protect a local Special Area of Conservation, the Lough Hoe Bog SAC, under the European Habitats Directive.Now residents are hoping that history will be made if the planning authorities are allowed to activate a public interest clause in the directive, known as the Imperative Reasons of Overriding Public Importance. But this has never been used in Ireland before.It would permit Sligo County Council to green light the new treatment plant because of the “urgent public health imperative”.The council has referred the Irish Water planning application for the €6 million to €7million treatment plant to Minister for Local Government Eoghan Murphy, as required under legislation.Two separate boil water notices have been issued at Lough Talt since February 2018, the most recent one on January 11th.A previous application in 2015 by Irish Water for a treatment plant was refused by the county council, and also by An Bord Pleanála, because of the potential impact on the special area of conservation.The latest planning application was accompanied by a Natura Impact Statement. It notes that the proposed development would have a “significant adverse affect” on the area of conservation but the council argues that because there are “no reasonable alternative options” , the imperative reasons measure is justified.Lough Talt Water Warriors spokeswoman Kellie Cadman says that even if permission is granted, Irish Water has acknowledged it could take two years to provide the facility. The water warriors lobby group has organised a public meeting on the issue for April 1st.More than 5,000 people have already signed a petition calling for a mobile UV filtration unit to be provided while work is ongoing.A temporary solution?The national utility says the proposed treatment plant is a temporary solution with a life  of no more than 10 years, pending the construction of a new plant at Lough Conn some 40km away. But Cadman says young families and the vulnerable elderly cannot wait for two years.“At least my children are teenagers and you can explain the dangers to them, but this is a huge burden for families with babies and young children,” she adds.The spokesman added that Ministers in both departments have a consultative role, but the ultimate decision on whether to grant planning permission would lie with the local authority.MEP Marian Harkin says the hardship endured by 14,000 Irish Water customers could have been avoided when the Habitats Directive was implemented 20 years ago if the State had not adopted a “do nothing” attitude.She says special areas of conservation were designated without any actions being taken and sometimes without even the knowledge of landowners.“They were just lines on a map,” says the Independent MEP. “Our national policy has been to designate areas and just walk away.”The Lough Hoe Bog Special Area of Conservation aims to protect several species including the Geyer’s whorl snail, which Cadman maintains has not been seen for 150 years.“I think when people’s health is at risk, the snail goes out the window,” she says.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Leaflets distributed to 5,000 public offices to help public prepare for UK\u0026rsquos exit from EUDelay to nationwide ban has also provoked strong criticism from fuel distributors who have invested large sums in clean fuel plantsMartin Swords insists he was wrongly punished twice at Carrickmines Luas stationLegislation to pass Seanad, D\u0026aacuteil by Brexit deadline despite claims haste unnecessaryMap \u0026lsquoanomalies\u0026rsquo mean some embassies protected while others not, claims FG councillorTwo-thirds of command posts for troop rotation in Lebanon remain unfilledResearch contradicts earlier study showing decriminalisation led to greater uptakeCommon reasons include inadequate signage, notice errors and motorist proof of paymentFinance Bill introduced stricter penalties after claim producers had been manipulating systemNTA hiring extra staff due to build-up of appeals and complaints about private clampersUnions say the practices cost the State hundreds of millions of euro in lost revenue, and can deny workers key rights and benefitsAudit of Malawi scheme found governance and safeguarding fell \u0026lsquofar short\u0026rsquo of required standards\u0026lsquoI really believe that if it happened on the east coast it would have been sorted out long ago\u0026rsquoDaily expenses allowance increases to \u0026euro38.80 a week for adults and \u0026euro29.80 for childrenWatchdog seeks more clarity from Oireachtas committee on legal protection for reportEco-friendly journey to use biomethane in bid to play part in reducing carbon emissionsNeed for cost-benefit analysis on projects slowing down new homes, council chief saysAncient Order of Hibernians says it was \u0026lsquoshocked\u0026rsquo by post mocking Beto O\u0026rsquoRourkeMove follows row over use of a recording device to report hazing allegations"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3837190.1553456358!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"future of border fudged in 750 000 brexit information leaflets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe information leaflets say that avoiding a hard border remains a priority for the Government “in all circumstances”. Photographer: Bryn ColtonBloombergThe Government has printed 750,000 information leaflets to prepare people and businesses for Brexit but has fudged the issue of what would happen to the Border if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal.The leaflets are being distributed to more than 5,000 State outlets and public offices such as post offices, Garda stations, public libraries and GP surgeries as the Government ramps up preparations for Brexit.The public are being told in the two leaflets – one aimed at citizens and the other at businesses – that avoiding a hard border remains a priority for the Government “in all circumstances” but offers no clues as to how it would go about achieving this in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement.The leaflet says that without the proposed EU-UK orce deal “avoiding a hard border is more challenging and requires detailed discussions between Ireland and the EU and, ultimately, with the UK”.“In that scenario the outcome will be made public as soon as possible,” the Government says in the section under “Northern Ireland”.Irish citizens in the North are assured in the citizens’ leaflet, entitled “Brexit and You,” that they will “continue to have EU citizenship wherever they live” and that they will “continue to enjoy the right to travel and live and work anywhere in the EU and have EU protection against discrimination”.Common Travel AreaThe information leaflets highlight the Common Travel Area, the long-standing arrangements that will remain in place after Brexit that give Irish and British citizens the right to live and work in, and travel freely between, each other’s countries.The leaflets aimed at businesses encourage them to consider UK-issued certifications and licences that may no longer be valid in the EU after Brexit, particularly for medical devices, chemicals and building products.There had been plans to test some of the Government’s no-deal contingency planning this week ahead of the UK’s original departure date of March 29th but these have been put on hold after EU leaders last week granted Theresa May’s UK government an additional two weeks to find a solution to the Brexit stalemate.If the British prime minister can convince MPs to pass her withdrawal agreement, already rejected twice by the UK parliament, then the exit date will be pushed back to May 22nd to pass the necessary legislation.If she fails to get the agreement passed, the UK must propose an alternative plan by April 12th including the possibility of a longer Brexit extension and running candidates in the European elections on May 23rd.The Government’s more intensive preparations include a public information campaign that is likely to involve national adverts, highlighting information on Brexit preparedness that is already available publicly and directing people to information about Brexit on the Government’s main Gov.ie website.No decision has yet been made about the timing of possible adverts on the public awareness campaign that would run under the Government’s long-running “Getting Ireland Brexit Ready” slogan.The Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works, which are involved in no-deal planning, have said for operational reasons they are not in a position to provide detail on what, if any, simulated exercises may be planned to test the capacity of Dublin and Rosslare ports to handle post-Brexit border checks.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Henry NichollsReutersTheresa May’s cabinet will seek to agree a new strategy for Brexit on Monday amid mounting pressure on the prime minister to set out a timetable for her resignation. Mrs May and senior ministers met leading Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, at Chequers on Sunday in an attempt to win support for her Brexit deal.Earlier two cabinet ministers rumoured to be ready to replace her as prime minister offered public support to Mrs May, and said there should be no immediate change of leadership. David Lidington, Mrs May’s de facto deputy, and environment secretary Michael Gove both dismissed speculation about a possible caretaker premiership.“I don’t think that I’ve any wish to take over from the PM who I think is doing a fantastic job. If there’s one thing that working closely with the prime minister does it’s cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to do that task,” Mr Lidington said.Mr Gove and Mr Lidington joined the prime minister at Chequers alongside chief whip Julian Smith, Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, foreign office minister Alistair Burt and Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis. Mr Johnson and Mr Rees-Mogg were joined by fellow backbenchers Steve Baker, Dominic Raab, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith and Damian Green. “The PM and a number of government ministers met today at Chequers for lengthy talks with senior colleagues about delivering Brexit. The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a meaningful vote this week,” a Downing Street spokesman said.Indicative votesMPs will vote on Monday on whether to take control of the parliamentary timetable this week to stage a series of “indicative votes” on alternatives to Mrs May’s Brexit deal. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond acknowledged on Sunday that if MPs reject the deal for a third time they will have to seek a cross-party majority for a different option.“Parliament will have to come together around a proposition that can gather a majority, and what I’m hearing in parliament at the moment is lots of different ideas from different factions, but that won’t solve the problem. “Those backbench leaders of different groups have got to get themselves together in a room and decide what they can compromise on because if parliament won’t compromise we’ll end up at the end of this process no further forward than we were at the beginning of it,” he told Sky News.Mr Barclay described MPs’ attempt to take control of the parliamentary timetable as “constitutionally unprecedented” and a very serious risk to Brexit. He suggested that if parliament instructed the government to negotiate a softer Brexit, including customs union or single market membership, there could be a general election.“Ultimately at its logical conclusion the risk of a general election increases because you potentially have a situation where parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do.” PostponedMonday’s votes follow last week’s decision by EU leaders to extend Britain’s EU membership, which was due to end next Friday, until April 12th. If Mrs May’s deal wins parliamentary approval this week Brexit will be postponed until May 22nd to allow Westminster to pass necessary implementation legislation.Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in London on Saturday demanding a second referendum, and 5 million people have signed a petition calling on parliament to cancel Brexit by revoking article 50.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said on Sunday that his party would demand that any Brexit deal MPs approve must be put to a confirmatory referendum before it can be implemented.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

I was extremely busy doing what everyone else in town was doing – nothing. Waiting. My house was the least of it – the whole city was short-circuiting.After word spread that Robert Mueller was going to deliver his report to the Justice Department at noon Friday, a fog of anxiety crept in on little cat feet. (Sorry, Carl Sandburg. ) After the president flew off to Mar-a-Lago, the skies darkened and rain pelted down. We drank coffee and waited. We ate burgers and waited. We watched basketball and waited for Mueller’s March Madness. All day, cable chatterers ranted about this being a significant moment in American history, but no one was sure yet what the significance was. As William Goldman once said of Hollywood, “Nobody knows anything.” And as Tom Petty sang, “The waiting is the hardest part.”Democrats yearned to have Mueller scream “Collusion!” like Marlon Brando once screamed “Stella!” And come to the podium to announce: “This is a real national emergency. The president is a Russian agent and needs to go immediately, along with his family.” They wished Bobby Boy Scout would go up to the Capitol and act like Rachel McAdams’ Regina George in Mean Girls, when she strides down the halls of the school scattering pages into the air that she had copied from the dishy Burn Book. No chance.MeticulousThe 74-year-old, an Ivy League graduate and a decorated marine in Vietnam, is so meticulous that he would not even deviate to wear a blue shirt when he ran the FBI, seeing that as compromising his integrity. He has run the only disciplined, airtight operation in the undisciplined, leaky Trump era. Not even Rudy Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, knew what was happening when the Times’ Katie Rogers tracked him down at the Trump hotel at 1.30pm, as he sat at a table in the lobby and worked his cellphone trying to get information.No one, from the president on down, knew exactly when the report would come or what it would say. With his usual bravado about his base, Trump told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo that “people will not stand for it” if the report was damning. All we really knew was that this was a pivotal moment, not only for Trump but also for his Javert.If the special counsel delivered a weak gruel, after all the time, money, newsprint and digital space lavished on it, people would demand to know why he hadn’t pulled the plug long ago. By Friday morning, White House officials had been feeling better and Democrats who had once fantasised that Mueller would put Trump in a jumpsuit to match his hair began to emphasise that it was their congressional investigations and New York prosecutors that were going to bring Trump to justice. Still, no one knew for sure.Happy HourIt was not thought that Trump would be indicted, because Justice Department rules say a president can’t be indicted. So, the question was: Would Mueller imply that the only thing that saved Trump from an obstruction charge was the fact that he was sitting in the Oval Office? How much evidence would Mueller show that Trump actually tried to obstruct justice? As Happy Hour approached, Attorney General William Barr notified the White House and congressional leaders that Mueller had delivered his report. The two Republicans are good friends who go back decades, a fact that startled Trump when Barr mentioned it during his confirmation hearings. (When Barr was attorney general the first time, under George HW Bush, he was Mueller’s boss, when Mueller led the criminal ision.)In his letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr said he might be able to brief them on the main conclusions of the report this weekend. The Justice Department said no more indictments were coming in the Russia investigation. Could Don Jr. and Jared have shaken off the bloodhounds? The scene Friday was far more occluded than the media hullabaloo on September 9th, 1998, when two dark vans pulled up to Capitol Hill with 36 boxes containing Ken Starr’s report on presidential chicanery.Starr was a star leaker and showboat, and journalists and the public were quickly able to get their hands on the document on which the fate of the Republic was hanging. It was something of a shock to learn that the supposedly dignified independent counsel – who was once on a shortlist for the Supreme Court – had delivered a 445-page bodice ripper, a trite story of an office affair in all its seamy particulars, told with such sanctimony that it was redolent of Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was clear that the sins recorded were not black enough to merit impeachment. Politicians in Washington have been having illicit sex and lying about it since George Washington slept here.Impeaching ClintonBut that didn’t stop Republicans from impeaching Bill Clinton that December. In the end, the reputation of Starr and the hypocritical Republicans, some of whom were having their own affairs with young government aides, suffered. And the country suffered as well. Clinton came out more popular, until #MeToo caught up with him. As much as Trump will spin victory and claim it’s all over, Friday was not the end of what the president tweeted was “the World’s most expensive Witch Hunt”. Democrats, aflame with investigative zeal, demanded that the report be made public and all of Mueller’s files be turned over to Congress. Mueller may be winding down, but the Democrats are just getting wound up.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"juxtaposed jigsaw art pictures","story":"Tim Klein, from Washington, USA, has been creating his surreal mash-ups from jigsaw puzzles since 1993.

The storm has killed hundreds of people and affected more than 2.6 million others with catastrophic damage occurring in and around Beira in southern Mozambique. Was Cyclone Idai caused by climate change?It’s impossible to say if the storm itself was caused by climate change but experts believe its impact was made worse by the gradual rise in temperature.How did climate change make it worse?Experts point to three factors.First, warmer air temperatures mean more rain is held and then released. Idai produced nearly a year’s worth of rain in just a few days - more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, increasing the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges are much more powerful, increasing the risk of the sort of inland flooding seen in the port city of Beira. Sea levels are about a foot higher than a century ago fed by melting ice at the poles.What do the experts say?“Cyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns,” said Mami Mizutori, the UN’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.What does the future look like for the region?Rebuilding with climate change in mind will be essential. This was not done after the last major cyclone 19 years ago. Roads, housing, utilities should all be built with future storms and flooding in mind.Sounds expensive, can this be done?Ironically, climate change makes future-proofing more difficult as the region’s economy, and therefore its capacity to rebuild, has already been depleted by rising temperatures, drought etc.At the Paris climate summit in 2015, then-prime minister of Mozambique, Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, said: “These weather phenomena affect the government’s efforts to meet national priorities, especially food security, that are critical to poverty reduction.”Secretary General of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Elhadj As Sy talks with a survivor of Cyclone Idai, at an evacuation centre in Beira, MozambiqueYes, developed nations, including the UK, are scrambling to send aid and disaster relief teams to the area.The rich nations also pledged in Paris 2015 to ramp up aid to $100 billion per year in restorative climate funding to poorer nations by 2020. This is because industrialisation in the west caused most of the current rise in global temperatures. But so far less than 10 per cent of this funding has been secured.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyDavid Lidington and Michael Gove deny they will replace Theresa May in coup over BrexitChild, 11, and woman injured in suspected shooting in LondonCriminals use dead rats to smuggle Spice into jail because prison black market in drug is so lucrative Charity launches super-complaint against police for treating slavery victims as criminals, rather than protecting them from perpetratorsPrince Charles pays respects to  revolutionary hero in landmark visit to CubaWinston Churchill\u0026#39s top hat and cigar found on Rubbish dump to be valued on Antiques Roadshow Train bosses try to stop antisocial behaviour by playing classical music at hotspot stationsBaptiste, episode 6, finale review: an oddly paced and underwhelming finale for the French detectiveVictoria\u0026#39s forgotten sister Princess Feodora: the real story of the queen\u0026#39s relationship with her beloved German siblingBaptiste, episode 6 finale recap: dirty dossiers and inside men, but who gets to live happily ever after?Victoria, series 3 episode 1 review: Victoria returns with poise, passion and higher stakesResidents in luxury apartment blocks to sue developers over \u0026#39Grenfell-style\u0026#39 claddingVeterans plot Cenotaph boycott in protest at soldier charged with Bloody Sunday murdersTheresa May\u0026#39s Government is \u0026#39chicken\u0026#39 and has \u0026#39bottled it\u0026#39 over Brexit, Boris Johnson saysComment: Theresa May is a chicken who\u0026#39s bottled Brexit.

In the former nation, rescuers were forced to let people die in order to save others.Will the death toll rise? Almost certainly. Emergency responders are struggling to reach parts of the three countries after some roads, bridges and communications networks were washed away or destroyed.The city of Beira with its some 500,000 residents is said to be 90 percent destroyed, while some 152 square miles have been flooded. Mozambique\u0027s president, after flying over the region, has warned as many as 1,000 people could die. But further deaths could occur if people clinging to hope are swept away by the rising waters or are not reached in time with critical water, food and other aid.And now authorities are warning of water-borne diseases after what infrastructure existed in the largely impoverished countries was stripped away.What is being done to help?Mozambique and Malawi are two of the poorest countries in Africa, and the economy of once-prosperous Zimbabwe has collapsed in recent years.Aid appeals for millions of dollars have begun as the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations rush to deliver food, water, fuel and medicines to the vast affected area. Tropical Cyclone Idai approaching the Sofala province of Mozambique on 14 March 2019, shortly after reaching its peak intensityThe European Union and Britain have been among the first to pledge aid. The EU says its initial package to Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi is worth about $3.9 million, while Britain says it will provide up to $7.9 million (£6m).The US Embassy in Zimbabwe says it is mobilizing support for partners in the three countries, with no further details.Tanzania\u0027s military airlifted some 238 tons of emergency food and medicine to the three countries. Zimbabwe\u0027s president has said a number of countries, including the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Angola, also were offering aid.Cyclone Idai and climate change | The Key questionsAid organizations and authorities are rushing humanitarian aid to Beira and other areas by air and sea, while rescue efforts push on.The torrential rains are expected to continue in central Mozambique until Thursday. As the water begins to recede throughout the region, the extent of the devastation will become clearer.And thousands, perhaps scores of thousands, of families could be on the move, seeking new refuge after their homes were washed away.

matteo salvini hopes end 25 years centre left rule elections","story":"Matteo Salvini on the campaign trail in the town of Muro Lucano in BasilicataMatteo Salvini hopes to end 25 years of centre-Left rule in a southern Italian region when it goes to the polls on Sunday, in the latest test his Right-wing party’s popularity ahead of European Parliament elections in May.The League is contesting the elections in Basilicata, a region that occupies the instep of the Italian boot, in alliance with Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s Forza Italia party and Brothers of Italy, a small far-Right party.The under-developed region, which boasts mountains and olive groves, is best known for the ancient town of Matera, where the inhabitants used to live in “sassi”, cave-like dwellings that in recent years have been turned into boutique hotels and restaurants.Its distinctive landscape and centuries of history earned it the plaudit of being named as one of Europe’s two Capitals of Culture for 2019, along with Plov in Bulgaria.Basilicata is known for the town of Matera and its ancient \u0026#39sassi\u0026#39 cave dwellingsMr Salvini, who is interior minister and deputy prime minister as well as head of the League, has been on a roll since Italy’s general election last March. Since then he has doubled support for his party from 17 per cent to around 35 per cent.The party performed strongly in recent regional elections in Abruzzo, Sardinia and Friuli Venezia Giulia, a region in the far north-east of the country.The election in Basilicata, where the centre-Left has been in power since 1995, is the last regional contest in Italy before the European elections at the end of May.Half a million people in Basilicata are eligible to vote on Sunday, electing a president and 20 members of the regional council.“After nearly 30 years, the Left should pack its bags and leave Basilicata,” said Mr Salvini, whose populist rhetoric and crackdown on asylum seekers has been condemned by human rights groups and opposition MPs.“I believe that the message that will emerge from Basilicata will be the latest confirmation of the need for change in the way this country is governed.”Matteo Salvini on the campaign trail with a group of factory workers in BasilicataOpinion polls show the centre-Right alliance ahead with 29 per cent, with the centre-Left on 26 per cent and the Five Star Movement on 16 per cent - a dramatic fall from the 44 per cent that Five Star won in Basilicata during the general election last year.While the League and Five Star govern together in a coalition at national level, they contest regional elections separately.Five Star, which triumphed at the general election last year, has since seen its support eroded and performed poorly in the last few regional elections.The centre-Right’s candidate, Vito Bardi, is a former general in the Guardia di Finanza, Italy’s customs and border police force.The candidate for the centre-Left, Carlo Trerotola, is a pharmacist from the city of Potenza, while Five Star’s candidate, Antonio Mattia, is a businessman.Five Star has been overshadowed by The League since the two very different parties formed a coalition last June.They have clashed on a range of issues, from cracking down on migrants crossing the Mediterranean to big infrastructure projects such as a stalled high-speed rail link that is supposed to run beneath the Alps, linking Turin with Lyon.Please review our commenting policyDavid Lidington and Michael Gove deny they will replace Theresa May in coup over BrexitChild, 11, and woman injured in suspected

He was sentenced to six years in jail.Shepherd had vowed to fight extradition, claiming his life would be in danger if he served his sentence in Britain.But it emerged on Sunday that he would consent to return at a hearing in Tiblisi, where he is detained in a maximum security jail, due to take place this week.A source told the Sunday Mirror: Jack feels that as long as he gets assurances he needs over his safety, it\u0027s now time to come back home.He knows at the moment he\u0027s just delaying the inevitable - and lengthening his sentence by staying.The two months he has served in custody in Georgia will not automatically be deducted from his sentence.Richard Egan, Shepherd’s UK-based solicitor, said he had not received any updates from his Georgian legal team and so was unable to confirm the development.He said the issue of whether or not time served in Georgia would count towards his sentence, would be subject to an application to the British court.Shepherd faces additional jail time for absconding as well as an outstanding GBH charge relating to an incident in a Devon pub just a day or two before he left the UK, when he is alleged to have knocked a barman out with a glass bottle.Miss Brown, from Welling in Bexley, south London, died when she was flung from his vessel in December 2015.The pair had met online and were on their first date.

This is what he did at the Dormen Food Company, and then at Lovedean Granola.However, after selling the granola business he was “looking around for something to do”.Created with Sketch.Stunning photos of food by Anett Velsberg Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Then I met Paul,” he says, referring to Paul Lindley, the founder and former chief executive of Ella’s Kitchen.“He’s a very persuasive and inspiring man,” says Cuddigan. “I have been selling stuff to supermarkets for 25 years but Ella’s has changed what I think about business and how it should be done.”One of the reasons that Ella’s Kitchen sparked Cuddigan’s interest was that the opportunity to work there arose just after the birth of his first baby,\u0026nbsp“so I was quite interested in the baby arena”, he says.“In any business there’s a certain intuition. For me having two kids means I’m interested. It certainly helps, it means I can empathise with our customers.”He joined the group in 2011 as a director, and became chief executive in 2013, taking over from Lindley.\u0026nbspThe widely held view is that it’s difficult to step into a founder’s shoes, but Cuddigan says that wasn’t the case for him.“Most people say it’s really really tricky but I have to say Paul was incredible. He knew how difficult it would be for me to take over with him sitting in the background, I knew it was difficult for him because he wanted to stay involved but he took a massive step back. Taking over was relatively easy because he was there to support me, and he gave me total autonomy.”Ella’s Kitchen dominates in two very important, overlapping markets – it makes food for babies and toddlers, and all its products are organic.“We are really proud of what we have achieved nutritionally,” says Cuddigan.Food in general has become too cheap and undervalued\u0026nbspand as such I think the quality of the food that we are eating is pretty poorHowever, despite the popularity of his brand, he thinks there is a long way to go with encouraging British consumers to make healthier choices when it comes to food.“I’m not sure that people are opting for healthier alternatives.”Cuddigan blames the low price of the products on offer in UK supermarkets.“Food in general has become too cheap and undervalued and as such I think the quality of the food that we are eating is pretty poor.”He gives the example of a ready meal that might retail for £1.50: “Once you have taken in the producers’ margin, you are probably talking about something that’s been made for 15p.Food exports to be turned away in no-deal Brexit ID mark \u0027chaos\u0027The surprising ingredients lurking in your foodInflation hops up with rising beer and food prices“We need to reset that in consumers’ minds, that good quality food costs money.”He readily acknowledges the reason Ella’s Kitchen is an outlier in this regard.“It’s difficult but ever so slightly easier in our category, because parents prioritise their children’s foods.”This adherence to high-grade, organic ingredients has made Ella’s Kitchen the popular brand that it is today, but it has also created obstacles.For one thing, it makes it difficult to compete on price. In recent years, Cuddigan says, Ella’s\u0026nbspKitchen came up with a new snack offering, but as it got closer to the launch, it became clear the product would be “more than two times the price of the nearest market rival” and so it had to be spiked.So would the company opt to use cheaper ingredients in order to lower retail prices?“The temptation is there but we are not going to do it, that’s a zero-sum game,” says Cuddigan.Meanwhile, the brand\u0026nbspis also facing turbulent times heading into Brexit.“A hard Brexit would be devastating to our business, because we have a very complicated UK supply chain and we use high-grade organic produce,” says Cuddigan.“We have been planning for over a year. In terms of time resource it’s been one of our biggest projects.“The most frustrating thing is we don’t know what we are planning for.”However, Cuddigan is clear that potential disruption will not have any impact on the quality of the products Ella’s Kitchen brings to the market.“The number one priority has to be trust,” he says, illustrating this point with a reference to the horse meat scandal which rocked the UK’s food sector in 2013.“We survived that scandal, we knew we were going to be fine, because we knew exactly where our meat was coming from.”“I want to be happy at work and I want to do work that’s valuable,” Cuddigan says.“I feel quite strongly that when you look at these companies that have been in scandals they will have values that are stuck up on the wall. If they followed those values they wouldn’t be in those scandals.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It was on the side of the angels with the second of those, and stands a better chance of winning the next fight\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHyundai\u0027s patriach Chung Moon-Koo. The family Chung family is locked in a battle with Elliott over HyundaiHyundai Motor was celebrating victory this morning. Its investors rejected a demand for the appointment of several new directors and a huge special idend, tabled by the activist investor, Elliott Advisers, which has become a major thorn in the side of the South Korean conglomerate.\u0026nbspPaul Singer’s outfit may have pushed too hard when it came to the size of the Won7tn (£4.7bn) idend it wanted. Hyundai has vast reserves of cash, but its profits have been in decline and the global outlook is cloudy for the motor industry. Given the latter, it’s perhaps understandable that investors baulked and opted for the company’s offer, even though it is worth less than a sixth of what Elliott was proposing.It was on far firmer ground with its demand for a shake up in the boardroom to foster improved governance and greater accountability at the firm, one of the country’s famed family controlled Chaebol that have long dominated the South Asian nation’s vibrant economy. They have been facing criticism on a number of fronts, including the charge of taking minority investors for granted.\u0026nbspHyundai creates app to unlock and control vehicles with mobile phoneHyundai unveils walking car to help save livesHyundai to introduce new electric cars for 2022While this battle may have been lost Elliott’s war is far from over.\u0026nbspIt won a dust up\u0026nbspover a proposed\u0026nbspownership restructuring last year, which critics held was designed solely to benefit the Chung family, and cement its control.The next one will come when a revised plan is submitted later this year. Hyundai only needed the support of 50 per cent of its investors to knock Elliott back over the idend and board seats, and it was assisted by investors such as South Korea’s National Pension Service, the second biggest shareholder, falling in behind the Chung family.\u0026nbspA revised restructuring plan could require up to two thirds support to pass. Elliott should find that easier to win if it objects by aligning with other overseas investors. They hold about half the company.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They can be of benefit to lumbering,\u0026nbspunderperforming companies with moribund boards that get stuck in the mud and are in need of a good jolt. But they can also cause a great deal of damage in their desire for a quick buck, leaving scorched husks behind them and longer term investors scratching their heads and wondering how it happened.\u0026nbspHowever, while its demand for a huge payout from Hyundai is debatable, Elliott’s call for improved governance sees it on the side of the angels. It\u0027s a sad fact that good corporate governance is an under rated virtue\u0026nbspand it sometimes seems to require the movement of financial mountains to achieve it. Elliott is a rare outfit with the clout to make it happen when so minded.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIts activities are certainly being watched very carefully by other Chaebol for fear they’ll be next\u0026nbspas investors in the country demand more influence, better returns.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The supermarkets described the CMA’s provisional findings into the merger, as “prohibition in all but name”.Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley added: “We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings.Created with Sketch.

It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors.

Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti.

John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.In the trailer, Dora is seen attending high school for the first time after spending most of her life in the jungle with her parents.The 40 greatest film soundtracks of all timeEvery Marvel Phase 4 film announced so farThe 65 best movie insults of all timeDespite being told to stay in the city while her parents search for the City of Gold, Dora finds herself leading her monkeybest friend Boots (voiced by Danny Trejo), Diego (Jeffrey Wahlberg) and a group of her schoolmates on an adventure to save her parents and solve the mystery of the lost city.The film is directed by James Bobin, with Julia Pistor, John G\u0026nbspScottiserving, and Derbez as executive producers.

Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Everyone, including Facebook, have tech debt and security debt that piles up. But that\u0027s not an excuse any longer, Sam Curry, chief security officer at security firm Cybereason, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Facebook is starting to look like critical social infrastructure, where there responsibility is to the public.

How can we trust this platform to get bigger and get more connected under the hood if they can\u0027t do the basis blocking and tackling right?

Their deaths on Pakistan’s ‘Killer Mountain’\u0026nbspleave a sport reckoning with its own burgeoning popularity, writes Adam WithnallClick to followThe IndependentThe bodies of British climber Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi were found after a two-week searchTom Ballard will never climb Everest. Before his death on Pakistan’s Nanga Parbat was confirmed earlier this month, the prodigious British mountaineer would joke that he had been scaling peaks since before he was born –\u0026nbspin a way, it was what he was born to do.\u0026nbspAged just 30, Ballard already had some extraordinary feats on his climbing resume, foremost among them his record for scaling all six of Europe’s most challenging north faces in a single winter.Ballard’s mother was Alison Hargreaves, the first woman ever to climb Everest solo in 1995 and who, equally famously in the eyes of the press at the time, then died descending K2 the same year, leaving behind a husband, Jim, and two children, Tom and his sister Kate.\u0026nbspShe carried Tom up the north face of the Eiger in the Swiss Alps when she was six months pregnant, and after he was born the family moved to Scotland so Hargreaves could practice on the local crags.The story of how Ballard came to attempt this particular mountain –\u0026nbspthe mountain where his body will remain unless and until a recovery attempt is made –\u0026nbspis as much about his co-climber Daniele Nardi as it is about the way this extraordinary, exhilarating yet occasionally deadly sport has evolved since Ballard’s mother’s own demise.Ballard, 30, and Nardi, 42, were attempting to reach Nanga Parbat’s 8,126m peak via the most direct route, the Mummery Spur. It is an audacious approach, flanked on both sides by towering ice walls that make avalanches a regular occurrence and requiring “mixed climbing” across both ice and rock, a technique beyond even some of the most proficient mountaineers.Created with Sketch.Peaks of Europe Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘Peaks of Europe’ is a photobook by Johan Lolos.

Published by LannooThe dangers and challenges are such that no one has ever successfully taken the Mummery Spur route in winter before. And for Nardi, who had already turned back from four previous attempts at the same expedition, that was the point.\u0026nbspThe Italian was obsessed with the route, says Pakistani climber and tour operator Ali Muhammad, who accompanied Nardi on his 2014-15 attempt but chose to turn back when conditions became too hazardous.In winter this mountain is so dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go – down or upNanga Parbat is known as the “Killer Mountain” for a reason, he tells The Independent. “In winter this mountain is so very dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go –\u0026nbspdown or up. Then we have no choice:\u0026nbspjust hold on until we get better weather.”It was only three years ago, in early 2016, when an international team of climbers made the coveted first winter ascent of Nanga Parbat by any route, leaving K2 as the only mountain above 8,000m anywhere in the world that has yet to be conquered in winter.Muhammad says he understands the urge to conquer a mountain in a way that has never been done before. “Daniele and Tom were trying to make a new history in winter climbing,”\u0026nbsphe says.But the Mummery Spur, he says, is not just one of the hardest ways to summit Nanga Parbat\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit is, in Muhammad’s view, the most difficult unconquered route anywhere in Pakistan, perhaps even the world.Nanga Parbat is seen as a far greater challenge for serious climbers than Everest\u0026nbsp(AP)Simone Mori, the star Italian climber among the group that completed the winter ascent in 2016, has described the Mummery Spur as “suicidal”. “It is ice, rocks, snow, and deep crevasses, and that’s just to reach Camp 2. After Camp 2 there are no crevasses. It is all vertical,” Muhammad says.Nardi and Ballard last made contact with base camp when they were at an altitude of about 6,300m. After a search of almost two weeks, their bodies were found using a high-power telescopic lens by Spanish climber Alex Txikon, another of the successful 2016 ascent team. The families consented to the release of the images, showing two figures and a tent lying close together on a small patch of snow at the bottom of a gully, surrounded by jagged rocks.What changed in the sport of mountaineering between Hargreaves’ generation and that of her son, Ballard, and Nardi? Everest is still Everest, the highest peak on the planet, its height unchanged,\u0026nbspmore or less,\u0026nbspfrom 1995 to 2019.Rather what has changed is our perception of what is humanly possible, argues Jake Meyer, a mountaineer who at the age of 21 years and four months became the youngest Briton to scale Everest in 2005.\u0026nbspHe says that the cultural allure of Everest comes from the fact that it wasn’t climbed at all, that we know of, until Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay as late as 1953.The number of climbers worldwideAfter that, the landmarks tumbled:\u0026nbspin 1975, the first woman to reach the summit. In 1978, the first successful climb without supplemental oxygen. In 1980, the first winter summit. All the way to Hargreaves’ own achievement in 1995. To elite climbers, Everest now has little left to offer.Like Ballard, Meyer started climbing when he was young, gaining a degree of competency quickly so that his youth alone was basis enough to set new benchmarks and, almost just as importantly, attract the interest of sponsors to make the expeditions possible.\u0026nbspHe describes a never-ending “arms race” among professional mountaineers to keep pushing the boundaries and achieve things that have never been done before, or at least do them in a way that is new –\u0026nbspplaying with the “semantics”, he calls it.Nanga Parbat is the ninth tallest mountain in the world (AFPGetty)Nardi was keenly aware of this competition, and indeed saw it as integral to the sport. Pakistani mountaineer Karim Shah Nizari quoted him in a tribute after his death by saying: “He always said, ‘A climber is someone who climbs new routes’.”In a modern world of social media and round-the-clock connectivity, that urge to open up new frontiers and explore the world’s last wildernesses may be appealing –\u0026nbspbut it is also one “that has always been there” as a driving force for the great historic mountaineers, Meyer says.The difference now is that with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, hundreds of thousands of fans around the world can follow their favourite climbers’ expeditions in real time.Nardi’s official Facebook page had more than 100,000 followers at the time of his death. The latest updates in the search and rescue operation for the pair were distributed direct to supporters by Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. And Alex Txikon, who has more than 58,000 Facebook followers, shared dramatic photographs and video from the frontline of the search.Alex Honnold, the first solo climber to scale Yosemite’s El Capitan Could this new exposure, and the fact that sponsors pay a lot of attention to mountaineers’ status as modern influencers, be another factor leading them to take greater risks? It’s a question Meyer poses. “Everyone is so aware of what everyone else is doing,” he says. “You have\u0026nbspto be doing bigger, badder, more awesome and, as a result, slightly dangerous things to keep up? I think that if people are treating it like that, then it is a race to the bottom.”If mountaineering and climbing have taken an edgier and more extreme turn in the past 20 years, it isn’t just on new media formats that people are taking notice.\u0026nbspUp until the turn of the century, the sport was considered fodder for low-rent thrillers like Vertical Limit (2000, starring Chris O’Donnell), Cliff Hanger (1993, Sylvester Stallone) and The Eiger Sanction (1975).Something changed around the time of North Face (2008), a critically acclaimed German film about the competition to scale the most dangerous ascent of the Alps. In 2010, 127 Hours about mountaineer Aron Ralston’s fall down a canyon in Utah was runner-up for six Academy Awards.\u0026nbspFinally, this year the suspenseful Free Solo, about Alex Honnold’s successful climb up Yosemite’s El Capitan rock wall without a rope, won the Oscar for best documentary.I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel aliveClimbing is now officially cool –\u0026nbspand there are figures to back up the assumption that young people who might once have been inspired to take up skate- or snowboarding are now turning to their local bouldering gym instead.\u0026nbspIn North America, indoor climbing is set to be a billion-dollar industry by the year 2021, according to the Climbing Wall Association, with a record 43 new climbing gyms opening up across the US in 2017.The International Federation of Sport Climbing estimates 25 million people are climbing regularly worldwide, with the number of young competitors in the UK up 50 per cent in the past five years.\u0026nbspAnd in another landmark for the sport unthinkable a generation ago, sport climbing will feature at the summer Olympic Games for the first time in history next year at Tokyo 2020.Created with Sketch.Jake Meyer: youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right“It’s amazing to see how much it’s changed over my career, and we’re talking 20 years since I watched the new millennium dawn over Kilimanjaro,” Meyer says.\u0026nbsp“It’s incredible, fantastic, and it’s an inspiration.”As the sport’s popularity continues to grow and its elite members keep pushing the limits of what’s possible, a point will be reached where mountaineering must pause and take stock of the element that makes it stand apart from other pursuits – the extraordinary risk to life involved.The Italian climber Mori has been the most outspoken in the community since Ballard and Nardi’s deaths, telling The Times newspaper that “if we continue to say they were just unlucky, the risk is someone will die there next year”.And if the trend continues for increasingly young climbers to seek out the road less travelled, in search of new and more impressive feats, the dangers posed are not just from the mountains themselves.\u0026nbspSearchight)Nowhere is this more evident than with Nanga Parbat. In 2013, a major terrorist attack was launched at the mountain’s base camp, itself a remote outcrop 4,200m above sea level that can only be reached on foot.\u0026nbspThe attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, killed one local guide and 10 international climbers, among them an American-Chinese citizen who was believed to have been the prime target for the gunmen in a kidnapping gone wrong.In 2013 at Nanga\u0026nbspParbat\u0026nbspbasecamp a\u0026nbspterrorist attack by Pakistani Taliban claimed the lives of one guide and 1o international climbersAfter the massacre, the gunmen walked for five hours before eating breakfast at a village and dissipating in the small hours of the morning. An AFP report a year on from the attack suggested most, if not all of the perpetrators remained at large.\u0026nbspThe 2013 attack aside, the Gilgit Pakistan region where most of the country’s biggest mountains lie is generally very safe, far from the restive western border with Afghanistan.Trekkers and climbing enthusiasts are starting to return to the region in larger numbers and can expect encouragement from visa officials and a warm welcome from locals, says Karra Hadri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the sport’s governing body in the country.\u0026nbspHadri, who remembers Ballard from the time when he visited Pakistan as a toddler with his mother and was carried up to K2 base camp on a porter’s back, says last year there were more than 40 major expeditions in Pakistan –\u0026nbspup from just one or two in the years after the 911 attack.The Bigger Red Nose Climb: Charity trek could do with less BallsStray dog follows climbers to become first to reach Himalayan summitWoman becomes first in India to climb ‘men only’ sacred mountainBut he is concerned that growing numbers of young people will come to the country seeking adventure and put their lives in danger. He is calling for a change to the regulations for permits, so that climbers must prove themselves on smaller peaks before attempting any of Pakistan’s five 8,000m-plus summits.“Mountaineering in Pakistan, especially above 8,000m, can be very difficult compared to the rest of the world,” he says. “We still have many mountains that have not been climbed, but youngsters need to know the risks. They should have a lot of skill, a lot of experience, and much budget. And they should go in a group,\u0026nbspnot just one or two alone.”Hadri was closely tracking the progress of the search operation over the past two weeks and was “very sorry to hear” about Nardi and Ballard’s fates. “Tom’s mother was a brave lady,”\u0026nbsphe adds.Ballard is survived by his sister, Kate, who posted a message on Facebook after he went missing thanking people across the world for their “love and thoughts”, and by his girlfriend Stefania Pederiva, who wrote: “I will find you in nature, in the rivers, in the trees, in the mountains, you will always be my most beautiful rock.”Nardi is survived by his wife Daniela and a son Mattia, who is just six months old.\u0026nbspAnd while the sport mourns two of its most promising sons, climbers as a whole are stoic about the risks they take in pursuit of their passion.\u0026nbspMeyer, who last year joined an elite group of only 10 Britons to have scaled K2, says he cannot imagine removing the element of danger from mountaineering,\u0026nbspdespite having, like Nardi, young children at home.“I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel alive,” he says.\u0026nbsp“If you remove the element of risk completely, then what you are left with is almost every other sport. Having children didn’t change my desire to want to go, but what it did was it gave me three times the reasons to come home safe.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

And it deserves to be considered along with the other proposals that you’ve got on the list.”That list included a softer Brexit, a crash-out no-deal Brexit and revoking Article 50 to scrap departure – only the last two of which Mr Hammond ruled out.A new referendum is likely to be among the options if MPs successfully seize control of the Commons agenda to stage “indicative votes” on Wednesday.Carnival of colour as a million people turn Brexit protest into party‘One million’ protesters say: ‘Give Brexit decision back to people’Get ready for a new PM, but it may be too late to save BrexitHowever, it’s best chance of success is if the prime minister’s deal is allowed to pass – subject to it being confirmed in a referendum, with the alternative of remaining in the EU.Ms May has hinted she will not allow the third “meaningful vote”, after the Democratic Unionist party read the last rites on it last Friday.On indicative votes, Mr Hammond said: “One way or another, parliament is going to have the opportunity this week to decide what it is in favour of, and I hope that it will take that opportunity – if it can\u0027t get behind the prime minister\u0027s deal – to say clearly and unambiguously what it can get behind.”Crucially, he said a decision had not yet been taken on whether Tories, including all ministers, would be given a free vote – the only way the Commons’ true preference could be revealed.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Others believe it would fail to make the difference anyway.The guest list for the emergency Chequers summit drew criticism that Ms May was still turning to an “an old boys club”, rather than listening to different voices on Brexit.Hammond urges MPs to ‘get together in a room’ to solve Brexit crisisIt included Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, David Davis, Damian Green, Iain Duncan Smith, who arrived in an open-top convertible, and Jacob Rees-Mogg – with his young son, in suit and tie, in tow.Downing Street sources said the aim was still to win backing for a third “meaningful vote” on the Brexit deal this week, although Ms May herself has said it could be pulled.A spokesperson for the prime minister\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“The PM and a number of government ministers met today at Chequers for lengthy talks with senior colleagues about delivering Brexit.“The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a meaningful vote this week.”Rees-Mogg and his eldest son Peter arrive at Chequers (LNP)Likewise\u0026nbspMr Gove, the environment secretary, said\u0026nbspbefore heading to Chequers: “This is a time for cool heads. It’s not the time to change the captain of the ship.”Many questioned how a caretaker could be imposed, given that – under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act – he or she would need the backing of the entire Tory party to win a no-confidence motion in the Commons.The next twist in the Brexit drama will be a cross-party attempt on Monday to grab the Commons floor on Wednesday, to stage so-called “indicative votes” on all options, to try to find a “winner”.Some ministers had suggested free votes for all Tory MPs, including ministers, to truly open up debate, but Mr Barclay stamped on the process in a BBC interview.He made clear a result would be rejected if it were to “collide with fundamental commitments the government has given in its manifesto” – which included leaving the EU customs union and single market.MPs trying to legislate for such a dramatic shift in UK policy would also be triggering a longer Brexit delay, requiring participation in the European parliament elections.Brexit hypocrisy highlighted by nationwide billboard campaignCarnival of colour as a million people turn Brexit protest into partyGet ready for a new PM, but it may be too late to save BrexitHeseltine says PM’s No 10 speech ‘affront to parliamentary democracy’“The risk of a general election increases, because you potentially have a situation where parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do,” Mr Barclay said.The threat was angrily dismissed as “nonsense” by Nick Boles, a pro-EU Tory behind the “Common Market 2.0”\u0026nbspplan for a softer Brexit, by retaining single market membership.“The PM cannot call a general election whenever she feels like it,” he tweeted. “She would need the backing of 23 of MPs. No way that most Tory MPs are voting for an early election.”Mr Boles condemned the refusal of European Research Group\u0026nbsphardliners to “compromise with reality”, adding: “They can’t impose hard Brexit because they don’t have the votes. They can’t force an election because they don’t have the votes.”On the Labour side, Keir Starmer strengthened the party’s backing for a Final Say referendum – despite, like Jeremy Corbyn, failing to attend Saturday’s march.“If a deal goes through, if the prime minister’s deal, if she tries it a third time, goes through, it ought to be subject to a lock or a check, which is it’s got to be confirmed by the public,” he said.The prime minister will host a cabinet meeting on Monday morning, ahead of a testing statement to the Commons on the EU’s imposition of a new Article 50 deadline at last week’s summit.A No 10 source was not ruling out a second cabinet gathering on Tuesday, as the crisis gathers pace, saying: “One day at a time.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

We’re here because we want to make today joyous. We want to show the world this movement is celebratory.”It was, perhaps, the perfect articulation of Saturday’s Put It To The People march.More than a million people – if organisers are to be believed – descended on London to request just one thing: to be asked again on Brexit.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from the Put It To The People protest Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hundreds of thousands of people take part in the protest calling for a referendum on the final Brexit dealYoung marchers sit on the lions at Trafalgar Square in LondonA young marcher speaks into a megaphoneAnti-Brexit campaigners gather in Parliament Square800sqm banner of a David Davis quote1165 Norman Cook aka Fat Boy Slim with the Stop Brexit Sound System,Thousands of people flocked around the Stop Brexit Sound system as it wound it\u0027s way through crowds.

They came bearing balloons and banners, face paints and flags – and, above all else, smiles and good humour.“Have you ever seen a more polite crowd?” asked Silvia Angelotti, an Italian business analyst who has lived in London for 22 years. “Believe me, a march of a million people in Italy – it is not so calm, not so orderly, I think.”Heseltine says PM’s No10 speech ‘affront to parliamentary democracy’The best signs from the Put It To The People march in London‘Million’ protesters gather in London for march against Brexit Celebrities fund transport to Brexit protest for new EU referendumSurrounding Ms Angelotti as she walked down Whitehall – to where speakers included London mayor Sadiq Khan, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and The Independent’s editor Christian Broughton – was a sea of noise and a mile of colour. Or, rather, a mile of blue and yellow.The shades of the EU were everywhere, from teenagers resplendent in streaks of yellow eyeliner to mums (and dads) donning long blue wigs. Think cup final day on Wembley Way, and you have the right sort of vibe. Only here, supporters were asking – given the closeness of the first result, given the misinformation they say was spread, and given the ever-unfolding sense of calamity – for a chance to rethink and replay.“That’s not an unreasonable request,” said Sorcha Kirker, an archaeology student at University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) in Scotland. “Theresa May has given parliament two votes on this – and she wants another – so why are the people being denied a second say? That isn’t democracy.”Ms Kirker herself\u0026nbspwas speaking after a 28-hour journey to be in London. The 27-year-old lives on Orkney. To get to the capital, she had to leave home at 4.30am on Friday, take a boat to the mainland town of Thurso, travel by train to Inverness, and then, at 9pm, catch the 12-hour overnight bus to London.If you’re reading this anytime between 8.30pm on Saturday and 10pm\u0026nbspon Sunday, she’s still on her way back home again.“Am I tired?” she asked. “Well, I got about two hours sleep on the bus so that’s something. You come to something like this and adrenalin takes over anyway. There are 24 of us here from the UHI, and we’ve all come because this is too important to miss because of something like geography. It’s our future. Brexit is a disaster. It takes away so many opportunities from young people that our parents had – that can’t be fair.”She and her group were carrying massive EU flags – but placards were largely the order of the day.Indeed, if national referendums could be initiated by the sheer originality of signs being waved alone, it’s probably fair to say, the Electoral Commission would, right now, already be organising a Final Say vote.They varied from pop cultural references (“Frankie Says Remain”) to the poetic (“Let’s stay among the stars”), to the somewhat crude: “If only Nigel’s dad had been so keen to pull out,” read one.Bright yellow stickers featuring the slogan “Bollocks to Brexit”, meanwhile, were everywhere. Including, by the end of the day, entirely covering the Cabinet Office front door in Whitehall. After one person\u0026nbspstuck their sticker there, hundreds more protestors followed suit – turning this historic door yellow.“If Theresa May really thinks she knows how we feel, she might want to look at her own Cabinet Office entrance next time she passes,” said Rob Hollinger, as he added another circular sticker to the mass. “She says she speaks for the British public. She doesn’t speak for anyone here.”It was a sentiment shared by 14-year-old Jacob Henry. “I got off my Xbox to be here,” his placard told the world.The youngster, from Milton Keynes,\u0026nbspwas there with his parents and 16-year-old sister Alice.“I don’t know if any of this will make a difference,” his dad Leroi, a 49-year-old academic, said. “But maybe the momentum is starting to move in favour of a second vote. I feel the country is starting to shift but I don’t know if it will be too late. But I just think, as a family, we felt we had to try to do something. We had to be able to say in future we gave this a shot.”Pursued by a toilet, Farage’s foot soldiers slog 270 miles for BrexitIt was a hopefulness and positivity that infused the spirit of the whole procession.With a petition asking for Article 50 to be revoked topping 4\u0026nbspmillion signatures even as the march started, many people felt, now more than ever, the tide of opportunity was turning towards them.Certainly Alice Joinel hoped so. She was the mother of possibly the youngest march participant of all. Carried in a papoose\u0026nbspwas nine-week-old Anouk.“How’s she found it?” said Alice, who works in publishing in London. “She’s actually slept through most of it. Woke up for the odd feed, then gone back to sleep again. She seems pretty unfazed.”The 32-year-old came because she felt it was important for the little one’s future.\u0026nbsp“Leaving the European Union is going to make her future so much harder and with so fewer opportunities,” she said. “And as a parent, that’s unbearable. So we had to come. Her dad – my partner –\u0026nbspis actually French, so you might say she wouldn’t even be here without the EU – that’s how important it is to us.”As the day came to a close – anti-Brexit chants still filling the twilight – a band could be heard finishing off in Trafalgar Square: Brass Against Brexit.How did march go for the group?“Brilliant,” said James again. “A few of us in this band play\u0026nbspGlastonbury every year and we’ve played the Rio carnival and, of course, it’s impossible to compare. But this was special: just people getting into it, waving their flags, giving us thumbs up. It felt like we were a part of\u0026nbsphistory.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

At one point nearly 2,000 people were signing up every minute.Bristol West and Hornsey and Wood Green in London tie for the two constituencies with the highest proportion of sign-ups with 33 per cent of the\u0026nbspelectorate having signed it, according to the website livefrombrexit.Caroline Lucas’ constituency Brighton Pavilion comes in third place, with\u0026nbsp32 per cent of the electorate supporting the petition.Jeremy Corbyn’s constituency Islington North has the tenth highest proportion, with 30 per cent of voters having signed the petition.The most popular political petitions in UK historyAnd in pro-Brexit Labour MP Kate Hoey’s\u0026nbspVauxhall constituency,\u0026nbsp25 per cent of voters have signed the petition.By contrast, just 2 per cent of voters in Walsall North, Conservative MP Eddie Hughes’s constituency, have signed the petition.A “heat map” of the petition shows the areas where the greatest support lies, with petition responses mirroring Remain-voting areas in the 2016 referendum. This includes London and\u0026nbspcities and towns with a relatively high student population such as\u0026nbspWarwick, Canterbury, Oxford and Cambridge.As the petition attracted attention, conspiracy theories arose suggesting that a small proportion of signatures from addresses listed as overseas meant that Remain campaigners had been adding fake signatures.Others suggested that the technical problems on the parliament website were a plot to prevent further signatures.But in a\u0026nbsptweet, the petitions committee clarified that 96 per cent of the signatures are listed as from the UK.Woman who started Revoke Article 50 petition receives death threatsRevoke Article 50 petition becomes most popular in website\u0027s historyNigel Farage accused of hypocrisy after anti-Brexit petition claimsWoman who started Revoke Article 50 petition receives death threatsThey added that overseas signatures were valid, since “anyone who is a UK resident or a British citizen can sign a petition. This includes British citizens living overseas”.The woman behind the petition, Margaret Anne Georgiadou, says she has\u0026nbspreceived multiple telephoned death threats after it rapidly gained signatures this week.The 77-year-old, who is currently in Cyprus, said she deleted her Facebook account following the “torrent of abuse” online.In a tweet on Saturday, she wrote: “Who wants Brexit so much that they are prepared to kill for it?”On the petition itself, Ms Georgiadou wrote: “The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’.“We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now for remaining in the EU. A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now.”Ms May ruled out halting the Brexit process when in Brussels on Thursday, telling reporters: “I do not believe that we should be revoking Article 50.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Her mother might be at the school, Fatia decides. A cry goes up as she approaches\u0026nbspit and people come running.\u0026nbsp“Mama!” She is\u0026nbspthere. They embrace\u0026nbspon a concrete walkway now littered with cooking fires and tiny children, one nodding off beside a pile of still-warm ashes.\u0026nbsp“My home is gone, but I’m also happy because I can see my family,” Fatia says.\u0026nbspHer mother, Maria Antonio, says\u0026nbspshe last saw\u0026nbspFatia the Tuesday before the storm. “I didn’t know anything about her,” she says. “I’m very happy to see her.”\u0026nbspBut the fate of her other daughter, in the seaport town of\u0026nbspQuelimane, remains unknown.\u0026nbspIt is a common heartbreak for thousands of families in central Mozambique, who have no way to learn about missing loved ones as destroyed communications networks struggle to return.

Or they simply watch for news.\u0026nbspThe other end of the journey is the beach in Beira. Small children and barefoot women are\u0026nbspcarried off on a fishing boat and gathered together by aid workers in spitting rain. Some look\u0026nbsplost. Few carry\u0026nbspmuch. One small girl stands\u0026nbspalone, hugging herself, her eyes wide and pleading.\u0026nbsp“I hid in the mosque,” says\u0026nbspa 12-year-old boy, Ramadan Gulam. “I was there for a week.” He had come from Buzi with nothing but a bag of clothes and his brothers. “My father said to go because the floods would come again... I don’t know what to do now.”\u0026nbspChristina Machado\u0026nbsparrives\u0026nbspwith her two children and a bandage on her ankle. It was cut by a tin roof during the cyclone, she says.

So unusual, in fact, nobody can remember it ever happening before.Reports suggest the former vice president may announce he is entering the 2020 presidential contest with a named running mate beside him. The reports suggest he would like that person to be Stacey Abrams, a progressive 45-year-old rising star within the Democratic Party, who last year narrowly failed in her bid to win the governor’s race in Georgia.\u0026nbspLast month, in an event that underscored the shift in the party’s direction, she was asked to deliver the Democratic response to Donald Trump’s State of the Union address.Biden, 76, who for decades served as a senator from Delaware, has told supporters he is “95 per cent” committed to running. Even before any declaration, he heads the polls of potential Democratic candidates.One thing that may help him seal the deal with himself, is if he gets an agreement from Abrams to be his running mate, more than a year before he would hope to secure the presidential nomination.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

Abrams also had breakfast with another Democrat running for president, New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who tweeted a picture of the pair.On the face of it, Biden and Abrams would be an impressive ticket, as well\u0026nbspas a study in contrasts. He would bring experience of governance to the table, as well as an inside knowledge of the politics of Washington DC. He would also seek to appeal to white working class voters, some of whom voted for Donald Trump in 2016.\u0026nbspIn turn, Abrams would bring energy, dynamism and be a spearhead for the progressive ideas that are now ascendant within the party. She is a woman, and a person of colour. She is from the south, he from the north.“I think it would be a very attractive ticket,” Christina Greer, professor of politics at Fordham University in New York, told The Independent. “Some Democrats might prefer she be on the top half of the ticket, but I think even though she is a brilliant politician, it would be hard for her to go from the loss in Georgia to run for the presidency –\u0026nbspeven though we have white men doing that.”\u0026nbspBiden already has some standing among African Americans, especially older ones, as a result of his eight years of partnership with Barack Obama, Greer said. At the same time, during a career that included 36 years representing Delaware in the Senate, there are several incidents in his record that count against.\u0026nbspHis apparent bullying of Anita Hill, a witness during the 1991 Clarence Thomas confirmation hearing, who accused the man about to be made a Supreme Court of sexual harassment, was one. Another was his championing of a 1994 crime bill –\u0026nbsp“the toughest, most comprehensive crime bill in our history” according to him –\u0026nbspwhich disproportionately impacted minority offenders.Abrams has avoided commenting on the prospect of joining Biden, as he embarks on what would be his third run for the Oval Office. She told the AP she had not yet decided whether to challenge Republican David Perdue for the Senate seat from Georgia\u0026nbspthat will be contested in 2020.“There certainly is a connectivity between that and other 2020 opportunities,” she said. “My objective is to make sure I want to do that job. I’d not thought about the Senate before. The Senate is a different way to tackle the issues I see.”After Democrats last autumn regained control of the House of Representatives on the backs of women voters, and with four high profile women –\u0026nbspElizabeth Warren, Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspalready running, Biden is not the only person who sees the value of having a woman VP.The New York Times\u0026nbspsaid New Jersey senator Cory Booker had claimed a woman would be on the Democratic ticket, whether alongside him or someone else.\u0026nbsp“No matter what –\u0026nbspI’m looking you in the eye and saying this –\u0026nbspthere will be a woman on the ticket,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s in the vice president’s position or the president’s position, but if I have my way, there will be a woman on the ticket.”Texas congressman\u0026nbspBeto\u0026nbspO’Rourke made a similar undertaking to an audience in Iowa.Joe Biden should run as VP with Stacey Abrams leading the ticketBernie and Biden tied for frontrunner in new pollJoe Biden is not a meme — this is the truth about his voting recordTrump lashes out at rivals in wild weekend of Twitter rantsTrump mocks Joe Biden for gaffe teasing 2020 presidential runJoe Biden\u0027s verbal slip fuels rumours of 2020 campaign against Trump“It would be very difficult not to select a woman, with so many extraordinary women who are running right now,” he said. “First, I would have to win, and this is as open as it’s ever been.”\u0026nbspMike Fraioli, a veteran Democratic strategist and fundraiser based in Washington DC, said if Biden declared with a named running mate he could think of no precedent.\u0026nbspThe only similar situation came in April 2016 –\u0026nbsplate in the Republican primary contest –\u0026nbspwhen senator Ted Cruz named businesswoman Carly Fiorina as his theoretical VP pick. He did so in a last ditch effort to inject energy into his flailing campaign. A week later, he pulled out, ceding the field to Trump.Fraioli said the strategising of Biden, Booker and O’Rourke marked an important inflection point.“It shows the country has changed,” he said. “For the Democrats, a woman or a person of colour will fill one of the top two spots. It’s not going to be two white guys. That’s not happening. That’s gone.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

(AP PhotoGemunu Amarasinghe)Mr Thaksin was ousted as prime minister in a 2006 military coup and now lives in exile abroad to avoid a prison term, but parties allied with him have won every election since 2001.His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who led the Pheu Thai government that was ousted in 2014, also fled the country after what supporters said was a politically motivated prosecution.Thai voters prepare for return of democracy despite ‘rigged’ systemKatie Price fails to attend court and heads off to Thailand insteadCourt bans party that nominated princess for prime ministerMr Prayuth, the blunt-speaking army chief who led the 2014 coup, was hoping to extend his hold on power after engineering a new political system that aims to stifle the influence of big political parties not aligned with the military.About 51 million Thais were eligible to vote. Leaders of political parties opposed to military rule urged a high turnout as the only way to derail Mr Prayuth’s plans, but many voters stayed at home.Thailand’s powerful king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, issued a statement on the eve of the election saying the role of leaders is to stop “bad people” from gaining power and causing chaos. It was also broadcast on Thai television stations minutes before voting started.Invoking a speech by his father, the previous Thai king who died in 2016 after reigning for seven decades, King Vajiralongkorn said not all citizens can be transformed into good people, so leaders must be given support in ruling to create a peaceful nation.He urged government officials, soldiers and civil servants to look after national security.It was the monarch’s second notable intervention in politics recently. Last month, he demanded his sister Princess Ubolratana Mahidol withdraw as a prime ministerial candidate for a small Thaksin-allied party within 24 hours of her announcement.When it seized power in 2014, the military said it was to end political unrest that had periodically turned violent and disrupted daily life and the economy.The claim has been a selling point for Mr\u0026nbspPrayuth, who according to critics has overseen a period of growing inequality and economic hardship in Thailand.After the coup, political party gatherings were banned and pro-democracy activists and other dissenters were regularly arrested, interrogated and imprisoned. Just days before Sunday’s election, Pheu Thai said the houses of party officials and its campaign canvassers in some provinces had been searched by military personnel in an act of intimidation.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We were airlifted onto the helicopter which was quite a frightening experience,” Mr Browne told the BBC.He added: “I’d never been in a helicopter before, there were a lot of high winds, hovering overhead and the winchman came down and we were then collected up and so I shut my eyes as we arrived into the helicopter and there were 15 of us for about a 20-minute ride.”Some 20 injured passengers had been taken to hospital, Viking Cruises said, while others had only minor injuries.Police in Moere og Romsdal said the ship’s crew had managed to anchor in Hustadvika Bay, amid fears the vessel would run aground.The boat was then\u0026nbsptowed to Molde on Norway’s west coast with 436 passengers and 458 crew members still on board.Norwegian media said the majority of the cruise ship passengers were British and American tourists.

Thai voters went to the polls on Sunday in a long-delayed election following a 2014 coup, a race that pits a military junta chief seeking to retain power against a democratic front led by the populist party he ousted.Turnout was expected to be high among the 51.4 million Thais eligible to vote for the 500-seat House of Representatives, which will choose the next government along with a Senate that is appointed entirely by the ruling junta.Thailand has been under direct military rule since then-army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew an elected government linked to exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself was thrown out by the army in 2006.Critics have said a new, junta-written electoral system gives a built-in advantage to pro-military parties and appears designed to prevent the Thaksin-linked Pheu Thai Party from returning to power.Pro-Thaksin parties have won every election since 2001, but the past 15 years have seen crippling street protests that destabilised the government and hamstrung business.Created with Sketch.

I want to see love and unity. Everybody has one vote, one voice. Everybody wants democracy.The anti-Thaksin Yellow Shirts, mostly middle class and urban royalists who accuse his parties of corruption, have repeatedly taken to the streets, prompting the military to launch two coups in a decade.Thaksin\u0027s supporters, known as the Red Shirts, also occupied much of Bangkok\u0027s main business and shopping districts for months in 2010 after a court dissolved a pro-Thaksin government, again paralysing commerce until a crackdown that left at least 90 people dead and saw landmark buildings burned.While the election results are due to be announced within a few hours of polls closing at 5pm (10am\u0026nbspGMT), the make-up of the next government may not be clear for weeks, since no one party is likely to have enough seats for an outright win.The country\u0027s king made an unexpected and cryptic statement hours before the vote, recalling a comment made by his late father in 1969 on the need to put good people in power and to prevent bad people from ... creating chaos.Although he did not refer to any of the sides in the race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to the country\u0027s political factions - broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.The king\u0027s intervention was a departure from the approach of his father, who in his latter years usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.It followed a startling turn of events last month when a party allied to Pheu Thai nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king\u0027s sister, as its prime ministerial candidate. It was then disqualified by a court after the king said it was inappropriate for members of the royal family to enter politics.Thai voters prepare for return of democracy despite \u0027rigged\u0027 systemKatie Price fails to attend court and heads off to Thailand insteadAustralians welcome refugee footballer after Thailand sets him freeWhat happened last month ... and then the announcement last night shows that, in contrast to the former reign, that the monarchy is actively interested in monitoring what\u0027s going on and it feels that it has some stake in the future direction of the country, said David Streckfuss, a Thailand-based independent scholar.The junta-written electoral rules ensure the military will continue to have a say in the next government, even if Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha does not stay on as prime minister.Pro-Thaksin parties are expected to win the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives. However, the new system appears designed to prevent it from forming a government because it includes the junta-appointed 250-seat Senate in the vote for prime minister.The provision means Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha\u0027s Palang Pracharat Party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the House, while Pheu Thai and its potential democratic front partners would need 376.Among the potential Pheu Thai allies is the new Future Forward Party, led by 40-year-old billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, whose criticism of the junta has been scathing and faces charges under the Computer Crimes Act for a critical Facebook speech. Prosecutors have said they will decide whether to put him on trial days after the election.Created with Sketch.

Old parties may end up fighting again, so I think the new party is better, said Somkiat Rattanawibun, a 42-year-old business owner told Reuters after casting his vote in Bangkok.Two officially non-aligned parties could be decisive in whether pro-military or democratic front factions make up the next government.Former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the anti-Thaksin Democrats, has portrayed himself as a third way between the dictatorship of keeping Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha and a return to the corruption on Thaksinism, but he would likely have to side with one or the other to form a government.The Bhumjaithai Party of Anutin Charnvirakul placed third in the last election of 2011 and has grabbed attention for populist campaign promises such as legalisation of recreational marijuana and a four-day work week. It\u0027s unclear which side he would choose.Regardless of the make-up of the government, the election result is likely to yield a shaky coalition that will do little to soothe Thailand\u0027s deep political ides and may not be able to accomplish much, said Paul Chambers, lecturer in political science at Naresuan University in northern Thailand.There could be a stable government coming out of it in the short term, he said. But that kind of coalition is not going to last that long.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But this country won’t know where things are going to end up until April .On Wednesday, No Deal ­suddenly seemed a likely option again. The EU were saying they would only grant Theresa May’s request for an extensionher Brexit deal passed before March , something that is highly unlikely.I am told that at the No Deal ministers’ meeting on Wednesday night, “the mood was totally dferent to previous meetings, as people thought it might actually happen”.It was agreed that a small group of ministers — Theresa May’s effective deputy David Lidington, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Health ­Secretary Matt Hancock, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley — would meet again on Friday morning to take the preparations to the next stage.But on Friday morning that meeting was cancelled.Why  Because after the EU agreed to halt the UK’s ­departure until at least April , No Deal is once again highly unlikely.This delay meansMay’s deal fails again, ­Parliament will have enough time to step in and take ­control of the process.The three options now are: May’s deal passes, a softer Brexit is agreed in the next few weeks, or there is a much longer extension to allow a General Election to be held, which could mean no Brexit at all. At the moment, the Brexit deal isn’t going to pass.Getting it through was always going to be hard, but the errors Mrs May made this week have made it even more ­dficult.As one Secretary of State puts it: “She would have been much better off spending three days in bed.”Her speech on Wednesday night, criticising MPs, was also ill-judged, given that they are who she needs to win over.It was particularly mistaken given May had turned down an invitation to address her own MPs that evening.One normally mild-mannered backbencher tells me: “It was offensive to us. You decline to come and talk to us — then insult us.”The Government’s domino strategy for winning the vote required getting the DUP to come on board.There is only one way to change this dynamic — for May to offer to goher deal passes.This would instantly change the debate. In the past few days, one Tory MP who wants No Deal and another who wants a second referendum told me they would vote for a ­withdrawal agreementthey had a guarantee she would go.“An increasing number of people are saying their vote is contingent on her going,” says a senior backbencher.As one Cabinet minister admits: “Even that may not be enough.” But without it, there’s no chance of the deal passing next week.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.AMID all this uncertainty, one thing is looking increasingly clear: Britain will have a new Prime Minister soon.Opinion has turned against Theresa May ­following her ill-judged speech on Wednesday.“She has managed to offend everybody,” one previously loyal minister tells me.And one Secretary of State fumes: “She’s alienated Parliament, the Cabinet and the EU.”There are no shortage of leadership candidates sounding people out.Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, has the support of more ­Cabinet ministers than anybody . He is seen as a safe pair of hands and as having the ­emotional intelligence to hold the party together.Sajid Javid was the frontrunner. But as always happens in Tory leadership contests, that has put a target on his back. He has had a dficult few weeks and is losing support.Cabinet ministers are convinced that Andrea Leadsom is running. They point out how, at Cabinet this week, she spoke in a string of highly quotable lines about Leave voters being let down.Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is also expected to go for it. But many think she is more interested in framing the debate and pushing her pro-growth agenda than anything .Michael Gove is being urged to stand, with Mel Stride, the well-connected Treasury minister, at the forefront of efforts to persuade Gove to run.Matt Hancock is another being encouraged to enter the race. He is the new toast of the party donor classes, who think he offers competence. One MP describes him as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”.On the backbenches, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson are competing to be the Brexiteer ­candidate. Raab’s campaign is better organised – he has ten MPs gathering support for him.But Johnson has the proven electoral record and greater experience. One thing to remember, though. Tory leadership races are like the Grand National: Messy, unpredictable and the favourite rarely wins. THE absurdity of Labour’s Brexit position is that it accepts the withdrawal agreement.What it takes issue with is the political ­declaration, which isn’t legally binding.Voting through the Brexit deal would not stop Labour from getting to any of the softer Brexit ­outcomes that it has been proposing in recent months.You could negotiate almost any kind of Brexit from the withdrawal agreement.But Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t want to vote for it because he doesn’t want to vote for a “Tory Brexit”.It would bring the withdrawal agreement, ­without the political declaration, to the Commons and dare Labour to vote it down.If Labour blinked and the withdrawal agreement passed, we would then be out of the EU and into the transition ­period.The EU would also be satisfied and consider us to have ratied the agreement.If Labour voted down the withdrawal agreement, then it would be clear what their motives were.IF there is no chance of the Brexit deal ­passing unless Theresa May promises to go, who can tell her that This is what ministers have been discussing with each other in the past  hours. They think her No aides won’t, so somebody  needs to.The obvious candidate is Sir ­Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee of Tory MPs. Brady is discreet and respected. But it is now time for him to put on his grey suit and carry this message to May.May promising to go so long as the withdrawal ­agreement is passed would show that it really isn’t all about her.And history would view her in a much more sympathetic light.ONE reason why the UK might end up leaving the EU by April  is the Labour leadership don’t want the European elections to take place any more than ­Theresa May does.They know parties in favour of a second referendum would attack Labour for its equivocation on this point.Jeremy Corbyn, who walked out of a meeting this week because Chuka Umunna had been invited, wouldn’t want to give the breakaway ­Independent Group such a perfect launch pad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK itself has been more successful in recent years in growing its trade with markets outside the EU than with those that are inside the single market and customs union.It baffles me that so many British politicians have so little faith in Britain that they think we would be sunkwe had to stand on our own two feet.The mistakes that have brought us to this point are well known: agreeing to decide the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement before settling the future trading relationship with the EU agreeing to a “backstop” to prevent a “hard border” in Ireland allowing the militant Remainers in Parliament to damage Britain’s negotiating position by taking “No Deal” off the table and allowing our exit date to be deferred.If only we had accepted the EU’s offer two years ago to have a big Canada-Plus free trade agreement, we could have locked in certainty for business and spent the last two years trying to improve upon it!The question now is what’s the best way to achieve the proper Brexit that the British people voted for nearly three years ago I understand why so many of my Tory and DUP friends have voted against the PM’s deal. I told her in November the “backstop” made it impossible for anyone who wanted to leave the EU to vote for it: it could lock the UK into the EU customs union for ever.That is why I voted against it the first time. It’s also why I tabled the “Brady amendment” — which was voted through at the end of January, telling the PM to go back and ensure the “backstop” couldn’t become a permanent trap.When the Government’s lawyer Geoffrey Cox said the changes agreed would allow a way out in most circumstanceswe were faced with a tough choice.To take a risk and support the deal or keep voting against, hoping something better would emerge. It was defeated a second time, with a big majority against.Those of us who really want Brexit to happen and British politics to be able to get on with other things are now faced with taking a massive political judgment.By voting for the pretty threadbare deal Theresa May brought back from Brussels, we can ensure some sort of Brexit and then a new negotiating team that believes in what it’s doing can work to get something worthwhile out of the future relationship after we have left.If we don’t vote the deal through this week, it no longer looks like Theresa’s promise that “no deal is better than a bad deal” will be honoured. Two years ago,  per cent of you voted for a political party — whether Tory or Labour — that promised to implement the referendum decision.Two years on Labour is angling for a second referendumand lots of other MPs are pushing for a Brexit that amounts to staying in. Some want endless delay, a few are at least honest enough to admit they really want to ignore the decision of . million voters altogether.Meanwhile, the EU is creaking. Just as the EU is set for crisis, this country is poised for success.British businesses are sitting on big cash balances but are crying out for the certainty that will allow them to invest.If we deliver on our promise to leave in the coming weeks, Britain will prosper. If we get stuck in the departure lounge, our country will suffer.For heaven’s sake, let’s settle this now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the deal fails again it seems Philip Hammond and David Lidington will be knocking on the PM’s door to tell her the time has come to make an exit.But in the midst of this paralysing crisis even that is not an easy option.There is no clear route to appointing a successor in the short term. And with the party at loggerheads even a swt transition to a caretaker PM is perilous.After this week’s turmoil we face being stuck for some time with a lame-duck Prime Minister, whoever it may be.Britain needs a miracle to avoid it.The crushing of IS in Syria is a massive achievement.Defeating this self-proclaimed caliphate is the beginning of the end for a reign of terror which has claimed , lives and spawned , attacks over four bloody years.The courage and sacrice of the ­Western-backed forces that fought so fiercely to drive the jihadis from their final stronghold has been rightly praised by Theresa May.But she was also wise to caution that the ousting of the religious fanatics from their territory will not end the risk they pose.Many hardened fighters will go to ground in the area so they can continue to wage guerrilla warfare.Other dangerous extremists will no doubt flee to Europe and even to this country, still fuelled by their murderous hatred of the West.Like the mythical hydra with its many heads, cutting off one risks generating others in its place.Our security forces must now be on alert for a fresh wave of Islamic-inspired terror closer to home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she has lost the backing of much of the country and now her party.Her deal has only one, slim chance of achieving a majority in the ­Commons.That isshe pledges ­immediately to resign and set in motion the election of her successor as Tory leader and PM after we leave the EU on the new deadline of May .If she does so, Tory Brexiteers and the DUP must back the deal. Becauseit fails again this week we are heading for a much softer Brexit — or none.That will be a catastrophe for the country, the Tories and Parliament.Mrs May deserves huge credit. She is a dedicated public servant with an unshakeable sense of duty, who in  took on the greatest challenge of any PM since World War Two.She has stuck to it through thick and thin, showing remarkable resilience in the face of repeated humiliations, rebellions and a relentless barrage of vitriol from almost all-comers.Unlike so many she has determinedly respected the will of the Leave majority. The very concept of democracy has been degraded in many other countries, yet she has ­resolutely defended ours.She must now take the next principled step — and show she is not just another craven politician determined to cling to power.Mrs May has insisted all along that not only must the referendum result be honoured, as promised by both main parties, but that it must mean leaving the EU’s central institutions — the Single Market and Customs Union — as well as the remit of its courts.She has maintained that the power to trade independently outside the Brussels club must be secured. It is the economic prize of Brexit.This was exactly the right course. Those arguing to soften those red lines are almost entirely those who regret Brexit and wish to neutralise it.Sadly, many mistakes were made. A Remainer, Mrs May appointed a weak Cabinet of Remainer friends, most of whom considered Brexit a disaster to be managed rather than a historic opportunity to exploit.The Brexiteers she did appoint — David Davis, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and later Dominic Raab — were sidelined and ignored.The Government triggered Article  far too early without a plan for our departure. In hindsight it should have made rapid plans for No Deal from the outset, giving us a position of strength from which to negotiate.Mrs May said “No Deal is better than a bad deal”, only to have Treasury bureaucrats refuse to prepare for it.After her disastrous  election her sole focus became achieving Brexit while holding her party’s warring factions together and fending off Remainer rebellions in Parliament.While our economy, employment and wages have grown strongly there has been policy paralysis, with mediocre ministers left blundering along. We need not list here all Britain’s problems. They are many, and obvious.Her Brexit deal is not the worst imaginable. Those are the so-called Norway Plus option — which is not Brexit in any way — or the permanent Customs Union, brainlessly championed by Corbyn, which destroys the economic case for leaving.No one should pretend it is a great deal either. But it ensures that Brexit finally happens, ending the fractious Leave Remain debate and refocusing Britain on the far more crucial negotiations for a future trade agreement.The DUP and the Tory ERG will have to hold their noses and vote for it. And to win that unlikely support, Mrs May must set in place a truly dignied exit, culminating in a new leader.Theresa May will then go down in history as a great public servant, as the leader who delivered Brexit and proved to the British people that our democracy is robust and far, far more important than any inidual.PM, it’s time to move on.MAKE no mistake: the kne crime epidemic is now a national crisis.It’s tempting to think that it’s just gangs in London and our other biggest cities that are the cause of rising violence.But shocking figures demonstrating how far and wide this disease has spread must be a wake-up call for the police, the Home Office and the Cabinet.That we’ve now got young gangsters playing sick games in which points are awarded for stabbing certain parts of the body can lead to only one conclusion: we’ve completely lost control of our streets.Throughout the spike in violent crime, the Government has responded with a tin ear. They’ve allowed the Labour Party — under Jeremy Corbyn of all people — to become the party of law and order.At the last election, the Tories got a battering about police cuts and it was one signicant reason they lost their majority.With the very real possibility of another ballot coming soon, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid and the Chancellor must get a grip.It’s vital that they give police chiefs the cash and the powers that they need.OUR prisons are failing.The latest revelation, that drugs and phones are being smuggled in via the inside of dead rats, is just a symptom of the mess they’re in.Prisons should keep people who deserve it locked up and get them ready for a le on the straight and narrow.The Justice Secretary is considering scrapping short sentences because prisons are doing such a bad job of rehabbing people, leaving offenders on our streets who should be behind bars.And eventhey do end up inside, with violence on the up, it’s no surprise lags form rival gangs. That turns prisons into training centres for hardened criminals.Where is the Government  Promises of reform and a crackdown on violence seem to have produced precious little.The consequences of a busted prison system will be felt on our streets.SO-CALLED Islamic State might not have any physical presence left, but we can’t be complacent about the murderous ideology they spread across the world.Their promise of a reign of terror across the continent sends a chill down the spine.We must find and prosecute those IS fighters who have ed to the UK — believed to be as many as  — and spare us the inevitable leftie hand-wringing.There have already been far too many innocent victims of IS’s twisted dogma.We must do everything possible to ensure there are no more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That was made clear”.Another there added: “The PM’s future was the elephant in the room today. It’s the elephant in every room these days”.The showdown in the grand th house in the Chilterns came ahead of a massive week that will see the shape of Brexit decided, as well as the PM’s fate.Also yesterday as Westminster prepares to reach breaking pointMrs May refused to discuss resigning with the group, who want a Brexiteer to replace her in No to negotiate the next phase, a free trade deal.Downing Street aides also said she has never discussed quitting with them, and only husband Philip May would know her real thoughts.But Mrs May signalled to hardliners thatthey agreed to back her deal, it will be put to the Commons tomorrow in a third and final Meaningful Vote.Senior ally ministers with the PM in Chequers – including Environment Secretary Michael Gove and party chairman Brandon Lewis – warned the Brexiteers that it may be their last chance to stave off meltdown.Rebel Tory backbenchers will ally with Labour today to force a vote to take decision making powers from the Government to Parliament – and Chief Whip Julian Smith told the gathering at the PM’s country retreat that they will win.A fledgling coup to oust Mrs May for a caretaker collapsed yesterday when the two candidates tipped for the job – her de facto deputy David Lidington and Mr Gove - both ruled themselves out of it.Mr Lidington said: “If there’s one thing working closely with the Prime Minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task”.The coup attempt was blamed on Mr Gove’s supporters.Chancellor Philip Hammond attacked the plotters as “self-indulgent”.And IDS added: “They should be apologising and they should shut up, for god’s sake. That’s the last thing we want”.Meanwhile, a small handful of senior ministers who remain loyal to the PM have urged her to declare she will take the UK out of the EU on April  with no agreementthe third and final meaningful vote fails this week.The bid is being lead by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and party chairman Brandon Lewis.One senior minister told The Sun: “Pivoting to No Deal is the only way to keep the party on side.“If she agrees to do a customs union, she will lose half her MPs and be in Ramsay Macdonald territory.”Brexiteer backbenchers were bitterly ided on what to do yesterday, and fighting broke out on their WhatsApp group.Former London mayor candidate Zac Goldmsith lashed out at diehard Tory MP Anne Marie Morris: “When you are asked, as you will be, why you opted for years of paralysis, ision and the inevitable death of Brexit when you COULD have stopped the madness, what will you say “Yes, but my principles  ”Ms Morris replied: “My conscience is clear. I will vote against her deal and any extension”.Another Brexiteer MP switcher, Nadine Dorries, then chimed in to back Mr Goldsmith: “God, I want to cut my wrists.

The Prime Minister ploughed on with attempts to finally convince eurosceptic Tory MPs to back her deal. But she is facing intense pressure from her own party to set out a timetable for her departure first. The PM today summoned top Brexiteers including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg to a showdown at her official country retreat.They told her that to get her deal through she had to set out a clear plan for leaving No  to make sure the next stage of Brexit negotiations took place under a dferent leader.But one source in the room at Chequers told the Mirror that Mrs May refused to be drawn and offered them “no concessions” to get behind her deal. Over the weekend there were dramatic reports of an imminent Cabinet coup with Remainer ministers set to tell her to go. But two senior ministers, David Lidington and Michael Gove, who were cited as potential caretaker leaders rejected the idea today.    Mrs May will face her mutinous Cabinet tomorrow morning to agree a path through the most perilous week of her leadership. And she is expected to then face further calls to quit as she updates MPs on last week’s humiliating Brussels summit. A senior No insider admitted to the Mirror that Mrs May’s situation was “very precarious”. They added: “There’s a lot of anger out there and we have a very narrow window to try to make progress”. At the Chequers talks, Mrs May instead threatened MPs, also including former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis, with a softer Brexit unless they fell into line. “It was back my deal or get a softer Brexit,” the source said. Downing Street has been warning Tory MPs they could even face Brexit not happening at all, in a bid to get them to fall into line. The EU has given the UK until  April to decide on a way forward out of the current deadlock. A cross-party group of MPs will today try to control of the Brexit process from the Government, with a series of “indicative votes” on the alternative options taking place on Wednesday. Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who is spearheading the move, said he believed enough MPs would back their plans, although it was unclear whether the Government would give MPs a free vote.    But Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay warned that the country could face a general election as a result of the “constitutional collision”. He said: “The risk of a general election increases because you potentially have a situation where Parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do.” Downing Street has yet to decide whether it will bring back Mrs May’s vote for a third time, with party whips pouring over the numbers. A No  spokesman said: “The PM and a number of Government ministers met at Chequers for y talks with senior colleagues about delivering Brexit. “The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a meaningful vote this week.” Westminster was rocked by reports yesterday that  Cabinet ministers wanted the PM to make way for someone , with Mr Lidington lined up to temporarily take over. Other reports suggested ministers were plotting to install Mr Gove as caretaker leader. But Mr Lidington said: “I don’t think that I’ve any wish to take over... One thing that working closely with the Prime Minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task”. Mr Gove added: “It’s not the time to change the captain of the ship, I think what we need to do is to chart the right course.” Philip Hammond admitted all was not well in the Tory party but accused MPs trying to topple Mrs May of being ”self-indulgent”. The Chancellor became the most senior minister yet to hint that the option of a second referendum was on the table, saying it was a “perfectly coherent proposition which deserves to be considered” alongside others. An online petition calling on the Government to cancel Brexit reached five million signatures just after hundreds of thousands of people marched through central London demanding a so-called People’s Vote.Jeremy Corbyn came under pressure from Remainers for failing to attend the march and instead campaigning in the local elections in Morecambe, Lancashire. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said that Labour could fight a snap general election pledging to hold a public vote on any Brexit deal.He said the party was now clear that any deal should be subject to a confirmatory vote.

Flushing away a powerless Prime Minister — along with the Article  Europe exit clock — would give crucial space for a rethink and a general election. We are a humiliated nation, the laughing stock of the world. We must either pull ourselves together and change direction or future generations will condemn our foolishness. The worst option is allowing a Tory coup to install in Downing Street the Cabinet’s most untrustworthy Minister, expert-hating Michael Gove, or the most unknown, bland David Lidington.  Tory MPs are shutting out the public, playing pass the parcel with the keys to No  and concocting a bad Brexit deal to hold the party together. These are shenanigans worthy of a banana republic. Conned Brexit voters are entitled to be angry after the lies, deceit and illegality of a self-serving, corrupt Brextremist elite. One million people marched on Saturday opposing Article  and a petition calling for its revocation quickly topped five million — including more than , in May’s Maidenhead backyard. This shows the change in mood since the referendum, called by a previous Prime Minister in a past Parliament, was narrowly won through dishonesty and by demonising migrants. An election and a subsequent second referendum would be about jobs, living standards, prosperity, public services, security and the very essence of this country.    Whether we want to be fair or unequal, decent or indecent, tolerant or bigoted, insular or outward. Jeremy Corbyn up against whoever replaces May would put the nation in charge. We would have the option of radical hope with Labour or continued decline with the Tories. The outgoing PM was at Chequers yesterday. Begging serial liar Boris Johnson and Tory enemies to spare her while Chancellor Philip Hammond accuses Conservative colleagues of self-indulgence is a messy end. Labour PM Gordon Brown was a global giant as he led the world out of the banking collapse. Brexit’s shown May to be an inadequate national pygmy. We’re worth a new government, a Labour government, rather than a Tory shoddy Brexit fix under a Downing Street makeweight.

She was desperate to be the first female PM – and was mfed when Maggie beat her to it when she was still at uni. But she got her leopard-print- shod foot in the door of No – where she’s shown herself to be a leader without backbone, negotiation skills, charm or a persuasive voice – or sometimes a voice at all.  Forget running through fields of wheat, Theresa. Leading your country into oblivion could top that in the naughty stakes. Still, she’s right when she said this week that we’re “tired of the infighting, tired of the political games… tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit”. It’s true. I heard more sensible debate in Lord Sugar’s boardroom when I was on The Apprentice. Mostly, though, we’re tired of her. Tired of her inability to lead, show clear direction and convince her MPs, let alone anyone in Europe. Why would anyone believe it is her way or no way on Brexit, when she has built her leadership on a mountain of U-turns  We are living under a cloud of gloom and uncertainty and blaming other MPs, and ranting for the cameras does not prove she is “on our side”. It proves she is desperate. Perhaps she should look to ­ordinary folk like myself for some inspiration on how to get results.  In my world, as a busy working mum of two, I would relate this to my everyday le. And Brexit would become an egg. Say I’m boiling eggs for breakfast and my kids must choose how they want them. Of course they are never going to agree – Zac wants his hard- boiled and Amara wants her soft. I tell them they must pick one – their school bus is nearly here. But they won’t ­compromise. “Right,” I say through gritted teeth. “Last chance – hard or soft ” So they cut off their noses to spite their faces and have no eggs at all. I’m not a tyrant. I give them another option. “Have Nutella on toast!” I say. But still no deal. I refuse to call the head to say we will be late because we are still debating breakfast. I do not want to appear indecisive and open to exploitation. I want trust and respect. Plus, the head would give me a polite, “on your bike, love”. But I know the longer I drag it out, the weaker I look. My kids need boundaries. They need to know who is in charge. Andthey can’t come to a ­conclusion, tough. I don’t want them to walk all over me – I have to show strength. So they go to school hungry. Andyou have good friends they will slip you some crisps to keep you going anyway. OK, some intellectuals might laugh at my analogy. But right now, we are the laughing stock of Europe. So maybe you don’t need ­intellectuals running this country. You need real people with common sense. Truly fighting for our side. Not stumbling out of the EU with all kinds of egg on their faces.

And speculation that she might be moving out of Downing Street sooner than expected has reached fever pitch after another turbulent week in Westminster. The Prime Minister told colleagues at the end of last year that she would step down before the next scheduled general election in  but the pace of politics means she could be gone before then. Hereaposs a look at key names currently being floated to take the helmMrs May steps down. Michael Gove  The Environment Secretary had a bruising experience in the last Tory leadership race but he is now seen as the favourite at - - according to Ladbrokes - to replace Mrs May, largely due to his Brexiteer credentials. In June , Mr Gove, who was campaign manager for Boris Johnsonaposs drive to succeed David Cameron, withdrew his support on the morning Mr Johnson was due to declare and threw his own hat in the ring instead.He came third in the first round of voting, trailing behind ultimate winner Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom.Mr Gove, , was born in Edinburgh, studied English at Oxford and was a journalist before becoming an MP. He is married to Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine. Despite speculation he could take the job, he told reporters on Sunday it was not the time to change the captain of the ship.  Mrs Mayaposs de facto deputy is seen by some as the natural caretaker prime minister but he has been clear he does not want the job. One thing that working closely with the Prime Minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task, he said on Sunday. Ladbrokes are offering odds of - for him to become Number aposs next occupant. The -year-old has been the MP for Aylesbury since  and was Minister of State for Europe from  to . He is married with four children. Boris Johnson Prominent Brexiteer and former foreign secretary Mr Johnson has been a leading voice of opposition to Mrs Mayaposs Brexit plan.The colourful Old Etonian was one of the key players in the  Leave campaign and resigned from the Cabinet following the Chequers summit in July. He was heavily tipped as a successor to David Cameron but ruled himself out of the  leadership contest after Michael Gove made a last-minute bid for the top job. Odds of him taking the helm have slipped in recent months to -, according to Ladbrokes, but he is likely to have the backing of many pro-Leave members of the party.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Huntwas a prominent Remainer in the  referendum. As Health Secretary, Mr Hunt fought a long battle with doctors over a new contract. The -year-old, who was first elected as MP for South West Surrey in , was appointed Foreign Secretary in July following the resignation of Boris Johnson. He chose not to run in the  leadership contest and instead gave his full support to Mrs May, saying it was not the right time to put his hat in the ring. Mr Hunt made a public sht towards Euroscepticism after the referendum, which could win him allies in the Leave camphe ran for the top job. Dominic Raab  With odds at -, Mr Raab is an outlier to take over from the Prime Minister but is thought to harbour ambitions for the role. Mr Raab, a prominent Brexiteer in the referendum campaign, was appointed as Brexit Secretary in July but resigned from the role in November, saying he could not support Mrs Mayaposs eventual deal. In his resignation letter on November , he wrote: Ultimately, you deserve a Brexit Secretary who can make the case for the deal you are pursuing with conviction. I am only sorry, in good conscience, that I cannot. Mr Raab, , has been the MP for Esher and Walton since he was elected in .  An outsider until today, there have been whispers about the former Education Secretary being up for the challenge of replacing Mrs May, at least temporarily. Senior Brexiteers suggest sheaposs well placed to be a unity candidate to soothe tensions between Leave and Remain factions. It comes after she played a key role in drawing up the so-called Malthouse Compromise.

On his first occasion he did OK, and promised the Government would review the case of an -year-old jobseeker who took his own le after being “belittled” by Jobcentre staff. But Emily Thornberry won the battle of the stand-ins.  He captained Sidney Sussex to victory in the  series of University Challenge - and appeared in a BBC special. Anything  we should know  He was given a CBE in David Cameronaposs widely criticised resignation honours list. And in May , it was revealed he had claimed £, on expenses for dry cleaning. He also claimed for toothpaste, shower gel, body spray and vitamin supplements on his second home allowance. He repaid the claims for the toiletries, saying: “I accept that many people would see them as over-generous.

Anxious staff immediately leapt into action, urging people to get down, worried that guests - many of them pensioners enjoying a luxury break on the high seas - would be flung around as the ship was battered by waves. Within moments the vessel was veering dangerously from side-to-side, with furniture, including a heavy piano, sliding around as the Viking Ocean Cruises ship navigated choppy waters. The shipaposs engines had failed, leaving it at the mercy of conditions off the coast of Norway, with the , people onboard fearful the boat would completely topple. A ceiling would collapse and in the moments that ensued  people were injured, three of them seriously.Are you onboard the Viking Sky or have you been rescued  Email webnews@mirror For Janet Jacob, who was one of the first to be taken to safety, it felt like a tornado. She told Norwegian broadcaster NRK: I was afraid. Iaposve never experienced anything so scary. Shocking pictures of the aftermath reveal how fittings came loose and debris was scattered everywhere as holidaymakers huddled together trying not to get hurt. Large  and doors were ripped off the outside of the ship, while inside objects were thrown everywhere leaving scenes of chaos.    American Jan Terbruegn said there was little time for panic after the order came to abandon ship. He told Norwegian news outlet Dagbladet: We could see that we were getting blown in towards some rocks. That was the most frightening thing I think. But luckily that wasnapost our destiny.  Many were not so lucky, and had to endure a miserable wait for hours as rescuers were hampered by limited means of helping people escape. It was only possible to lt  people to safety at a time, which meant many scared passengers faced an anxious wait to be taken ashore.  And with water seeping into indoors of the ship after a massive wave battered down a door to the deck, it was miserable for those caught up in the drama.Many took to Twitter to share their experiences, among them Ryan Flynn who wrote: It’s about .am local Norway time and many of us are still stranded on the Viking Sky.It’s miserable as the seas are still very high with strong winds. The ship continues to pitch and roll. Captain is hoping the winds and seas calm enough to bring ship into port. He later shared a video of his -year-old father being airlted from the cruise liner.  And Alexus Sheppard posted pictures of people sleeping everywhere, with many taking up spots on the floor to try and get some rest. Derek and Esther Browne, from Hampshire, said the whole boat was swaying, it was very rough before they were airlted to safety. Mr Browne told BBC Radio  Liveaposs Stephen Nolan: We had a few people on stretchers, several with cuts, two with broken limbs, but fortunately we were alright. We were airlted onto the helicopter which was quite a frightening experience.  He added: Iaposd never been in a helicopter before, there were a lot of high winds, hovering overhead and the winchman came down and we were then collected up and so I shut my eyes as we arrived into the helicopter and there were  of us for about a -minute ride. Police in Moere og Romsdal said the shipaposs crew had managed to anchor in Hustadvika Bay, amid fears the vessel would run aground. Rescue services airlted  people to safety from the luxury cruise liner and began towing the vessel to a nearby port. The Viking Sky, with , passengers and crew on board, sent out a mayday signal on Saturday as it drted towards land in the Norwegian Sea. The airlt of passengers, many of them elderly, from the Viking Cruises ship by helicopter was halted on Sunday morning as two tugboats started steering the vessel towards the nearest port.  Founder and chairman of Viking Cruises, Norwegian billionaire Torstein Hagen, told Norwegian TV: Theyaposve had a bit of a shocking experience. Most of our passengers are senior citizens... imagine what itaposs like to hang there on that wire. It must be a terrible experience but they seem to have handled it very well. The  passengers were mainly from the United States and Britain, the rescue services said. There were also Canadians and Australians on board, among others, the cruise company said. Some  injured passengers had been taken to hospital, Viking Cruises said, while others had only minor injuries. One was taken to St. Olavaposs Hospital in Trondheim and others were taken to local hospitals. Many have also been traumatised by the experience and need care when they arrive on shore, the Norwegian Red Cross said.

Viewers picked up on a line in the show the toddler was sleepy in the hours before she was picked up by her parents from a daycare centre at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in . People are now suggesting the McCann family were spied on and three-year-old Maddie was drugged by the kidnapper in the hours before she was snatched from her bed. Maddieaposs parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, were eating out with friends at a tapas restaurant close to the hotel and regularly checked up on their children before realising their daughter was gone. In the show itaposs said Maddie was sleepy on the day she was kidnapped and the fact her twin siblings, Sean and Amelie, failed to wake up when she vanished is adding fuel to the theory online.    Social media users believe the toddler was drugged after being watched by the kidnapper at the resortaposs Kids Club and that her brother and sister were also spiked. Nicola Begg said on Twitter in response to the show: So what[the kidnapper] had been watching Maddie, watched that the McCanns were leaving their apartment for dinner and checking every half an hour, then on the day she disappeared gave the three kids something to make them so tired they wouldn’t wake  Then went in after Gerry first checked on the kids, took Maddie easily as the kids had been drugged, sold her on etc  Just one theory. Fellow viewers of the eight part series, which retraces the steps of the moments leading to Maddieaposs disappearance and the subsequent investigation, agree it is a plausible explanation.    Maddie OaposLeary said: My opinion having watched episode   is that the McCann children were all sedated by someonethen someone abducted Maddie somehow and sold her through the dark web. Laura Spencer wrote: One theory - Kateaposs friends said Maddie was really tired coming back from the kids club. Possibly [someone] had his eye on her, drugged her earlier in the day to make sure she wouldnapost kick up a fuss when she was snatched later in the evening. The documentary series features more than  experts and people involved in the investigation.    But Kate and Gerry McCann refused to take part in the show. The programme covers ious versions of what may have happened  years ago from bungling cops pinning blame to Maddieaposs parents and claims she is still alive. Other parts of the show describe the dark trafficking side of Portugal with criminals able to transport stolen children easily to other countries.

She said she feared for her le, her body began shaking and her leg turned aposfloppyapos. Natalie had to undergo a series of operations, blood transfusions and skin grafts - and had metal bars inserted into her calf which was left with a gaping hole. After battling an infection, Natalie - now a mum-of-two - has recovered from the traumatic ordeal which left her unable to work for two years. Natalie, , married her partner, Paul, , in an intimate beach ceremony in Koh Chang.The couple then went island-hopping and were watching a firework display on the beach when firework careered into the crowd. It hit a coconut drinks display, setting one alight, before it smashed into Natalieaposs leg - breaking her tibia and fibula. Her husband and fellow tourists extinguished the flames and bundled the health care assistant on to a nearby sunbed and carried her to the road. Helpers unsuccessfully tried to load her into a tuk tuk, before she was put on the back of a pick-up truck and rushed to the nearest hospital.  Natalie, from Torquay, Devon, said: What was supposed to be the happiest time of our lives ended up turning into the most horric. When the firework went off, it careered into the crowd and hit the coconut drink display which set alight and fired straight into my leg. It all happened so fast. The next thing I know, people are trying to pat out flames as my dress caught alight and my leg is in agony. I really thought I was going to die or that Iaposd lose my leg. I feel so lucky to have survived and Iaposm relieved it wasnapost my daughter that the coconut hit - otherwise she certainly wouldnapost be here today. Natalie and Paul got married on Boxing Day in , and with their four-year-old daughter Ezme in tow celebrated New Yearaposs Eve with a party on Kata beach in Phuket. They said an unofficial fireworks display began on the beach - and they felt unsafe.  Natalie added: People were selling them on the beach and it wasnapost just the small ones you get in Sainsburyaposs - it was the big ones you get at displays at the seafront. Anyone could buy one and let it off and it was a bit scary. Natalie and her family felt uneasy and they were thinking about heading back to the hotel when disaster struck. She said: Someone bought one and let it off and instead of going up into the air it headed straight for me. It darted into the crowd. I didnapost even see it coming. As I went to stand up, I just fell down. The firework had hit a coconut drinks display - which was filled with alcohol - and placed on top of a table.  It had caught fire and shot off the table and into my lower leg. The power of the firework had fired the coconut in my direction. It flew straight into my leg - breaking my tibia and fibula and catching my dress alight. My husband was patting my dress, thinking I was on fire. He went to move my leg and it was all weird and floppy. I just went into shock - my whole body started shaking. Thankfully there was a male doctor from Belgium there and a female doctor from Australia on the beach. She was talking to me and saying: aposI work in ICU, Iaposll look after you, donapost worryapos.  She said it took an hour to get to AE, before she was transferred to a hospital in Phuket - a journey that took another two hours. I wasnapost able to have any pain relief either as they wanted to see our passport and travel insurance documents first, she said. It was am in the morning so Paul had to get in a taxi with Ezme and travel to our hotel - more than an hour away - and come back with the papers. I was begging for pain relief the whole time - I was in absolute agony. When they got all of our paperwork, they gave me some pain relief and rushed me straight into theatre and they put pins in both of my bones - the tibia and fibula - to fix it. Where the coconut had hit my leg, the impact had caused the skin to corrode and die. It was just getting blacker and blacker. Every other day I had to go to theatre and they put me to sleep while they cut away at the skin - it was called debriding. Unfortunately, their interpreter was on holiday for the two weeks whilst I was there so I also had to try and translate what they were saying on my phone. When I woke up in recovery, my arms had been strapped to the bed like a crucix. I got bed sores and my heels turned black as I wasnapost moved properly - as I should have been. I couldnapost get out of bed. I was in hospital for just over a fortnight. I had to have a blood transfusion and a unit of blood while I was there as I lost so much. I was on a morphine drip.  Natalieaposs family wanted to travel to be with her, but due to the busy time of year, they were unable to book flights. She said: My mum and dad were trying to get flights to see us - but they couldnapost book them as they were all full. I just had to grin and bear it. Our insurance company flew a nurse out from the UK because I was on so much medication. She was so lovely. Although the bones were mending, I had a hole in my leg where they had cut away the skin. You could see right to the metal work in my leg. Luckily weaposd taken out insurance and they paid for everything. They put the nurse and I in business class on an Emirates flight and flew us back to Birmingham in mid-January. An ambulance met me at the airport and took me to Exeter Hospital. Once back in the UK, Natalie saw a consultant, and surgeons had to remove some of the metal work in her leg to help it heal properly. They also took some muscle out of my right leg at the top, inside of my leg and put it in the hole in my lower leg and attached it to my main artery in my heel, she said. I was warnedit didnapost take, they might have to amputate below the knee and I was told that was likely to be the case at three dferent stages.  Doctors also found she had contracted an infection. They couldnapost work out why the bone wasnapost healing, she said. They found a bug in my leg - called shewenella alegia - which is a foreign bacteria, you donapost get in the UK. Normally fishermen get it or itaposs found in places by the sea, which makes sense as the accident happened on a beach. I was off work for two years in total as my leg just wasnapost healing. Natalie fell pregnant with her second child during the healing process, and had to go to Torbay Hospital to have IV antibiotics every day. She said: They said theyaposd never given anyone IV antibiotics for thatof time whilst being pregnant. They said I could have ended up having an amputation. I had to worry of not only being pregnant, but also potentially having my leg chopped off. A week before I had Orla, my second child, now four, in March , I had my the bars and cage removed from my leg.  Natalie is still recovering from the ordeal - six years on. She said: I get the odd pain now and again. Iaposve only got half the lymph nodes in my leg and have to wear a special stocking to stop the swelling. But I think anything is better than not having a leg at all. Iaposve changed in myself - Iaposve got bigger because I canapost move around as much as I used to. But Iaposm just thankful Iaposm still here and that it wasnapost my head, or it wasnapost Ezme, now  - she wouldnapost be hereit had hit her. If the coconut had hit my head, I wouldnapost be here either. Itaposs not all doom and gloom, Iaposve come out of it stronger. It couldnapost drive or get out and about. I couldnapost work. I was a prisoner in my own home for two years. When I took my little girl to the museum there was a big bang that sounded like a firework being let off and I just burst into tears. Whenever firework night comes up, I panic. When a loud noise sounds and Iaposm not ready for it orI donapost know itaposs going to happen I jump out of my skin. I feel like Iaposve got PTSD as I suffer from flashbacks too.

Vice-president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, had faced opposition - including from the church and local community council - to some of his plans for a massive development at his Highland bolthole, which was likened to a Travel Inn. The sheikh had initially sought planning permission for another  bedrooms at his Wester Ross retreat, but in December withdrew plans for one of the proposed two lodges. The withdrawn lodge, Ptarmigan, which had caused the most concern from objectors, was for nine bedrooms.  It has now been re-submitted to Highland Council with the sheikh altering its location to be a good neighbour. The sheikhaposs architects say the familyaposs trips to Inverinate have been limited by lack of accommodation - despite already having  bedrooms there - and another  approved last month. A supporting statement accompanying the latest application from agents Farningham Planning Ltd says the proposed new lodge is sympathetic to the existing pattern of development that prevails in the area, and compatible with landscape character and capacity within both the immediate and wider surrounding area. Given the close proximity of a residential property to the west, the proposed lodge has now been carefully sited a signicant distance away from this property in order to minimise any perceived adverse neighbour amenity issues. The -year-old sheikh, who founded the Godolphin racehorse stud, has made all his applications to Highland Council through his company Smech Properties Ltd.  Approved last month - subject to conditions - is a lodge for  bedrooms as well as a nine-bedroom house. With multiple wives,  children, numerous relatives and a large entourage of bodyguards and servants, Transport Scotland was concerned over the wear and tear to the local road caused by the sheikhaposs future trips to his Scottish Highland hideaway. It wanted the sheikh to detail how often he and his regal retinue are planning to head north and what the cumulative traffic impact will be. In response, the sheikhaposs company wrote back: The proposed lodges are for the sole, exclusive use of the current land owner and guests. They will not be rented out for tourist use. As with the current lodges, occupation is infrequent. They are not occupied for large periods of the year. It is anticipated that there will be no signicant increase in car movements above the existing traffic flow following completion of the construction phases. As with the current lodges, the majority of visits to the property are by either coach or helicopter, supported by a fleet of six x cars for shooting parties visits. There is no recorded data available on frequency of visits orof duration. Architectural designer Jonathan Mennie was among those who wrote to the council previously about the developments to register my strong objection.  What is currently proposed looks like a Travel Inn - indeed, all five buildings taken together transforms what was a picturesque estate with one sympathetic lodge house, into what looks like a hotel development under the guise of a aposprivate residence,apos he wrote. The first plans for Ptarmigan Lodge also drew protests including from Miss Tina MacLeod, who wrote:The sheer size of this colossal building would dwarf the existing church building at least twice over, according to the location plan. The expected light pollution from such a large hotel-sized building would be obscene, along with the possibility of excessive noise that would accompany such a large structure, during building and once occupied, this would make my familyaposs existence a living nightmare. The visual impact of the apospalaceapos is utterly hideous in an area such as this and I have no faith in the tedious design of the proposed developmentcarried through, being appropriate to this area. One must ask why Smech ltd are planning to fill the grounds of Inverinate Lodge with so many large, separate buildings for accommodation. Is this traditional Highland estate set to become yet another playground resort for the rich with little or no benefit to the local community  It is the latest scheme on the estate, which has a triple helipad site and a  bedroom holiday home, next door to a -bedroom luxury hunting lodge, with pool and gym. The sheikh, who is believed to have a fortune in excess of £ billion, bought the ,-acre estate more than  years ago for a reported £million.  His family visit every summer to escape the C Dubai heat. In an accompanying design statement for the new lodge, Inverness-based Colin Armstrong Architects reveal:The owners of Inverinate Estate typically travel in large groups of immediate and extended family and friends. In recent years their travel to Inverinate has been limited by lack of accommodation. Additional staff accommodation was completed in  to create infrastructure that would support greater use of the estate by the owner and this new application seeks to create residential accommodation for the use of the owners, their family and their guests in order they may enjoy more frequent and extended visits to Inverinate. Around Inverinate the sheikh is well-liked, employing several local people. He built a community centre, gted land for a day care centre and sheltered housing and gives venison to the elderly. Local councillor Biz Campbell said last year: Itaposs only when the family come that the helipads are used. Itaposs dead quiet otherwise.

Little Harris Brown was in so much pain he went into shock and had to be rushed to the hospital by mother Emma, the Daily Record reports.The two-year-old suffered spiral fracture that his thigh bone had been torn in half, doctors at Royal Aberdeen Childrenaposs Hospital said. Emma, from Moray in Scotland, recalled the incident that her son had been jumping on the soft mattress before she heard a aposvery clear snapapos when he landed in a pile of pillows. She said: They [doctors] for this type of fracture the most common thing was high impact car accidents, trampoline accidents, and the third thing was abuse. At first doctors feared he may be suffering from brittle bone disease, but this was ruled out by specialists who said it was just apossheer bad luckapos.    Emma still couldnapost get a clue of how her son could break the bone like that. I have no idea how it happened, it’s so bizarre. He was just being silly, throwing himself into the pillows [on the bed], she explained. But just when he landed I knew…. his body went one way and his leg went another and I heard a very clear snap. He cried initially and screamed and then he just went silent. It was almost ashe wanted to go to sleep. He curled himself up into a ball. I think it was his body going into shock with the pain. It was just sheer panic.    Itaposs said the fracture was caused by the bone being torn in half as a result of a twisting force or impact, and specialist had to discuss how to fix it. Due to Harrisaposs young age, doctors decided to put his leg in traction for three weeks, where by they stretched the leg and kept it in the same position to allow the bone to heal. Emma, a therapy radiographer, said: It was a long time but the hospital was just fantastic. The play leaders came round every day to keep him occupied. “He’s not the kind of boy who will sit and watch TV, that doesn’t interest him at all. So I did think, aposhow are we going to manage’. But he did amazing. When they were putting in traction, the big thing was to make sure it was set the sameas the other leg otherwise he would be left with a permanent limp.    She was told it could take at least six months for an adult to recover for the same type of injury. But eight weeks on, Harris is back on his feet and already wanting back up on the bed to bounce. Emma said: I donapost think heaposs learned his lesson. He still sits on the bed saying aposbouncyapos and Iaposm saying, aposno bouncy on the bedapos. Harrisaposs dad Dougal, , now plans to take part in the Staffordshire Half Ironman challenge in June to raise money for the Archie Foundation, the charity which provided play leaders who kept Harris occupied while he was confined to bed for three weeks.

Research carried out among , adults revealed the top  typically British traits, which also includes always having a stf upper lip, being tolerant and being culturally aware.Other classic British activities include dunking biscuits in tea, always talking about the weather and saying sorry too frequently.More serious character traits, such as respecting LGBT culture, sharing your feelings and being supportive of immigration only just made it into the top , below more trivial things such as loving a trip to the pub and having a fry-up for breakfast.    The study was commissioned by Sky Arts to launch Art , where  artists have created pieces to show what it means to be British. The results also identied dferences between the generations. More than half of over s see putting the kettle on in a crisis as typically British compared to just  per cent of millennials. And while  per cent of pensioners consider it British to be proud of where you are from, just  per cent of younger adults agree. Instead, millennials are more likely to consider a respect of LGBT culture as Britishalong with loving to hate the Royal Family . Phil Edgar-Jones, director of Sky Arts said: “As a nation, there are ious traits and activities which people believe define Britishness.   “But many people think this definition is changing over time, especially thanks to the Brexit referendum and our exit from the EU.“There is so much which is great about Great Britain, but the country is constantly evolving, leading to a dferent meaning to the phrase ‘being British’.” The study found talking about the weather is considered the most British trait, followed by queueing for things, always having a roast dinner on Sundays and putting the kettle on in a crisis. A love of fish and chips, going to pub and having a dry sense of humour are also thought of as typically British, along with good manners and not complaining about bad food in a restaurant.  But while  per cent of Brits would describe themselves as being typically British, the poll revealed that half think what it means to be British has changed over time. Almost one in three think the definition of ‘typically British’ has changed since the Brexit referendum and another  per cent think it will evolve again following our departure from the EU. And  per cent of Brits don’t feel they are able to show how proud they are of being British as much as they did before the referendum. Despite this,  per cent are proud to be British, with another four in  saying they feel this way ‘a little bit’. Just  per cent aren’t at all proud to be British. But according to the research, carried out via OnePoll, while  per cent of the nation would describe themselves as British,  per cent would say they are English instead. Just  per cent of Scots would describe themselves as being British, along with just a third Welsh folk and  per cent of those from Northern Ireland.  In comparison, half of those in Yorkshire would describe themselves as British rather than any other nationality along with  per cent of Londoners. Researchers also found that the Brexit negotiations have left more than one in  wishing they had voted dferently in the referendum after seeing how everything has played out so far. If there was another vote now,  per cent would vote to leave while  per cent would vote to remain. Although more than one in  have no idea how they would vote and  per cent wouldn’t vote.  It also emerged Queen is the music act most likely to leave us feeling proud to be British after being name the best of British, beating The Beatles, Elton John and David Bowie.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"what a week of music","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Music Festival drew to a close in fine style at Lochgilphead Joint Campus after a stunning week of performances and entertainment.The th anniversary festival has to go down as one of the most successful, featuring a record entry of competitors.The sun, at long last, shone on the closing day of the event on Saturday March  after a wet, dreich week.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields public need say","story":"NewsBob Shields: Public need say on Prime Ministers Brexit dealReal democracy is having a second voteShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsBlundering Theresa May heads the most incompetent Government weve had in living memory \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHow many Members of Parliament does it take to change a light bulb  The answer – of course - is just one. But it takes the other  of them over two and a half years to decide exactly what kind of light bulb they want in its place! In last week’s episode of Commons Comedy Capers, we had the Brexit secretary proposing the Government’s motion . . . then voting against it. Similarly, we had the Chief Whip – whose job is make sure MPs toe the party line – voting against his party line! Last Tuesday MPs rejected Theresa May’s deal, on Wednesday the rejected ‘No Deal’ and on Thursday they rejected sticking to the March  deadline. I watched the creaking, croaking Theresa at Prime Minister’s Questions and it looked like the only thing you could guarantee to be behind May . . . was June! When it comes to Brexit, the House of Commons has now had more votes than most Eurovision Song Contests. And as I write this on a dreary Monday afternoon – it seems certain that another vote is on the way. Theresa May is going to put her ‘deal’ to the Commons for a THIRD time . . . but onlyshe’s confident that she’ll win it! Yes folks – a vote ONLYshe knows she’ll win in advance. How’s that for democracy at work  So - we have a vote . . . another vote . . . and then another vote  Mmm – now where have I heard that before  Ah yes – now I remember - it’s been the Conservative party’s official ‘put down’ of every single request for a second “people’s referendum” on Brexit. It’s a line you can even trace it back to the lips of our very own Member of Parliament, Mr Bill Grant. “We have already had a ‘people’s vote”, he said. “Another vote, assuming it indicated a dferent outcome, would be presumably followed by another vote and another vote, and so on”. What Bill, and the Conservatives, have been telling us for months is that you can’t keep on having a vote until you get the result you want. But meanwhile, the leader of the Conservative party is doing exactly that! And it’s not asthe Prime Minister needs a five per cent swing – the dference in the Euro referendum – to get her own way. It beggars belief that she can take the biggest parliamentary hiding in history . . .and go back for a second and even a third bite at the cherry! It begs the obvious question –our MPs can get three chances to vote on the biggest political issue of our generation – why can’t the ‘people’ get at least a second vote  I’m also getting fed up with Brexiteers telling us “the public just want this pushed over theline so they can move on”.Er . . . no. The public I speak to want the right deal to leave Europe. Andit’s not on the table, theywant the right to reject it and stay in Europe. Is it too late to ask Bill Grant to stop puckering in the direction of Theresa May and start pointing his ears in the direction of his constituency, which not only voted to “remain” but voted him to Parliament to represent them  I hope not. Bill’s qualities might include loyalty . . . but he’s always open minded. My solution  Well, it might be a bit simplistic – but then most solutions are.  Parliament instructs the PM to ask to delay Article  for one year.  Parliament instructs the PM to form a cross-party Brexit Committee to begin new talks – and come back with the best deal that the combined parties have negotiated and will have support in Parliament.  Give the public an unbiased and detailed explanation of what the deal means. Put it to a referendum – accept the deal and leave – or reject the deal and remain. This way, the people of Britain - and Europe - will know exactly where they stand.By March   – we’re in or we’re out. And everyone, on every side, will have had their say. Bill, that’s real democracy at work.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnConservative PartyAyrBrexit"},{"url":null,"title":"gran who hurled bleach over","story":"Picture by contracted freelance Steve McKendrick\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gran who hurled bleach over a child has been granted a personal licence to sell alcohol by East Ayrshire council. Mary McLelland was convicted of throwing the cleaning agent over a -year-old boy’s head and body in Auchinleck. Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it. Councillor Cook said he would grant the licence “albeit with reservations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilCourtsJusticeAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"people say future high rise","story":"NewsPeople to have their say on the future of high-rise flats in AyrTenants asked for their preferred optionShareByGary Fanning:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTenants in the Riverside Place multi-storey flats in Ayr are getting the chance to have their say on the future of the high-rise properties as South Ayrshire Council’s consultation on ‘Your place, your future’ gets underway. The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"fiddle-groups-tuneful-donation-ahead-of-packed-schedule","story":"FIDDLERS in Selkirk will be dressed to impress this year as they embark on a series of major performances.Riddell Fiddles continue to be one of the most in-demand traditional instrumental groups in the region.And later this year they willto the sun to perform at the Barbados Celtic Festival.Four members of the group will also be joining with the Shetland Fiddlers to perform at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo .Closer to home Riddell Fiddles will have toes tapping at Hawick Reivers Festival and Tweedbank Festival.Ahead of a busy year, which also includes concerts at Allanton Village Hall and Eckford Village Hall, the junior section of the group, the Bannerfield Buskers, has been kitted out in new polo shirts.The tops were presented by Selkirk Rotary Club.Sheila Sapkota from Riddell Fiddles told us: \"Thank you to the Rotary Club for their continuing support and encouragement.\""},{"url":null,"title":"who-done-it-marks-lauder-amateur-dramatic-societys-70th-anniversary","story":"LAUDER Amateur Dramatic Society will perform lsquoA Tomb With A Viewrsquo for its production this week.The group is celebrating its th anniversary this year and it has picked the Norman Robbins comedy thriller to mark the occasion.Established in , the society performed its first play lsquoThe Wee Comicrsquo by Donald Kelly, a year later in Selkirk.And it has gone from strength to strength.A spokesperson said: ldquoThis years who-done-it mystery has as many twists as a corkscrew, and will keep the audience guessing until the last minute.ldquoBe prepared to sit on the edge of your seats and to feel shivers down your spine, coupled of course with some hilarity from the sinister Tomb Family and their associates.The show will take place at the Lauder Public Hall from March - at .pm.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish bay is britains second best beach","story":"The bay, which is the beginning of the longest continuous stretch of sand in Argyll, extending all the way to Westport, was second only to Sandown Bay on the Isle of White in the BBC Countryfile Magazine Awards .After a long and detailed judging process to determine the shortlist for each category, the magazine#s readers and website visitors were given a month to vote for their favourites, with winners announced last week.The magazine#s editor, Fergus Collins, said: #Congratulations to each of the winners – and all the people and places who were shortlisted.#The aim of our awards is to celebrate the best of the British countryside and shine a light on lesser known places, projects and people who are doing great work.#Westport beach looking towards Machrihanish Bay. _cwestport"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 15 2019","story":"Peter Docherty, born and brought up in the Wee Toon, lives in a first floor flat, in Tangy Place tenement, at the end of the High Street, with a #marvellous# view of all the comings and goings on Campbeltown Loch.Back in , aged , he was an apprentice painter and decorator for a town firm, which he thinks might have been Galbraith and Cochrane.Mr Docherty#s son, also Peter, , talked to the Courier on Monday and said: #Dad told me that the young apprentices were always given the awkward, high up places to paint.#Back then this wall must have been under a ceiling as now the graffiti chipped into the plaster is at waist height.#Painters always used to leave their mark on a building, many will be painted over in people#s houses.#They often wonderedtheir #marks# would be uncovered in the future.#On this wall they could see the names of people who had painted it in the past.#When he saw Down Memory Lane last week dad said he was the only P Docherty in the town at the time.#Peter junior, who visits two to three times a year, said: #I was born in Craigard.

which the papers were presented this year which made alternative motions possible.However what did this year yield The main dferences in the budget came down to the administration of the council proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been questioned by its community council which felt that too much had already been spent.The money for Dunoon was because of poor procurement processes and a general #I want syndrome#

We have listened.ldquoThe other week his proposals were rejected overwhelmingly by this House ndash why is he not listening Mr Corbyn replied he spent ldquoa great deal of time listening to people on the shop floor and in small businesses, and ldquothey want some degree of certainty, adding ldquoher deal does not offer that degree of certainty at all..pmMr Corbyn accused the Government of trying to ldquofool its own backbenchers and the British people over its Brexit deal.He said: ldquoThe unilateral statement is a weak Government trying to fool its own backbenchers because the EU has not even signed up to it.He continued: ldquoThe Government is in real problems because they are trying to fool the people into somehow believing that somehow or other the deal she has offered is the only one that is available.ldquoIt is not and they very well know that..pmResponding to Mrs May, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ldquonot a single word of the Withdrawal Agreement had changed.He said: ldquoAfter three months of running down the clock the Prime Minister has, despite very extensive delays, achieved not a single change to the Withdrawal Agreement ndash not one single word has changed.ldquoIn terms of the substance, literally nothing has changed hellip There is no unilateral exit mechanism, there is not time limit, there are no alternative arrangements..pmMrs May urged MPs to back the deal, saying: ldquoIt was not this House that decided it was time for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, it was the British people.ldquoIt falls to us here to implement their decision, their desire for change, their demand for a better, more open, more successful future for our country.ldquoToday is the day that we can begin to build that future.The PM added: ldquoLet us show what this House can achieve when we come together, let us demonstrate what politics is for.ldquoLet us prove beyond all doubt we believe democracy comes before party, faction or personal ambition.She finished by saying: ldquoThe time has come to deliver on the instruction we were given. The time has come to back this deal and I commend this motion to the House..pmOn the political declaration, Mrs May said: ldquoIrsquom sure we can all learn lessons from how we approach this first phase of the negotiations as we move onto the second.ldquoFor my part, Irsquove no doubt that the Government does need to build a strong consensus in the House before we go onto negotiate the future relationship. Not least to ensure the process of ratication is smoother than that for the withdrawal agreement.ldquoThatrsquos why wersquove committed to give a much stronger and clearer role for this House, and for the other place during the next phase. Not just a consensus in parliament either, businesses, trade unions and civil society must all play a much bigger part contributing their expertise in a collective national effort to secure the very best future relationship with the EU.ldquoThat new approach will start with the withdrawal agreement Billthe deal passes tonight, notice of presentation will be given tomorrow and the Bill will be introduced on Thursday..pm.pmWhen askedthe Irish Attorney Generalrsquos advice has changed, Irelandrsquos deputy leader Simon Coveney said that there are no changes to the backstop.ldquoThere are no changes to the backstop, what is signicant and dferent, and has legal effect, is around the reassurance of the temporary nature of backstop.ldquoThis is an insurance policy that nobody wants to use..pmDaniel Kawczynski, a member of the European Research Group, said: ldquoWe got the legal opinion from the Attorney General, which was not as strong as we had hoped for.ldquoThen our independent  of legal experts in the ERG, the eight of them, have given us their opinion that those guarantees are not sufficient and not watertight, and now we hear that the DUP will not be supporting the deal.

It says this: the UK is a country that honours the democratic decisions taken by our people in referendums and in elections.She added: ldquoI believe that we should be delivering on the vote of the British people in , but I also believe it is important that we give businesses hellip the certainty for their future, and there is only one certaintywe do not pass this vote tonight, and that is that uncertainty will continue for our citizens and for our businesses.She added: ldquoWe are a country where passionately-held views do not stop us from making compromises to achieve progress.

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9367886.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"edinburgh-art-festival-highlight-of-the-visual-arts-calendar-in-scotland","story":"The former Turner Prize winnerrsquos exhibition Julie Copersquos Grand Tour will be at the cityrsquos Dovecot Studios.Artists from around the globe feature in the programme for the th edition of the festival, which was announced by organisers on Monday.The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art will present amajor survey of work by Paisley-born Anya Gallaccio.As well as a wide range of contemporary art there will be major retrospectives, such as the Bridget Riley exhibition at the Royal Scottish Academy, spanning more than  years of the painterrsquos work.Sorcha Carey, festival director, said: ldquoBringing together national institutions alongside leading contemporary art spaces, commercial art galleries and artist-run initiatives, our Festival is born out of the rich reservoir of knowledge, expertise and passion for the visual arts that characterises our city all year round.ldquoAs ever, the breadth and range of the programme opens up space for surprising connections across time, art form and the city of Edinburgh itself.The Fine Art Society will show a group exhibition of portraiture by artists ranging fromJohn Byrne and Jenner McRae to Eduardo Paolozzi.Sculptor and former fashion designer Nicole Farhirsquos workWriting Heads, a series of  busts of th century novelists and playwrights, will be on display.Work by some of the most influential photographers of the th century also features, including Cindy Sherman, Francesca Woodman, Diane Arbus and Robert Mapplethorpe.Amanda Catto, head of visual arts at Creative Scotland, said: ldquoThe Edinburgh Art Festival is a highlight of the visual arts calendar in Scotland and an exceptional opportunity for people to experience a rich mix of exhibitions and events across the city.The festival runs from July  to August ."},{"url":null,"title":"what-the-papers-say-march-25","story":"The Times reports that the Prime Minster resisted pressure to set a date for her departure infor support for her Brexit deal after meeting prominent Brexiteers at Chequers.The Times   Brexit supporter Iain Duncan Smith driving an open top Morgan sports car, waves at two armed police officers as he arrives at Chequers for a y meeting with the Prime Minister.

This should provide some additional protection to consumers.ldquoElectrical safety is vitally important. Every year, there are fatalities caused by electric shocks and fires caused by electrical mals. It is important that people carrying out electrical work are qualied and able to do so.ldquoI was pleased to get so much support from across the political parties when this was debated back in October and I would hope that support would carry across to introducing a Bill on the subject.Skills Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ldquoThe serious concerns raised about electricians are being considered fully and we are committed to continuing to work in partnership with all stakeholders.ldquoDuring a debate in Parliament in October last year, I offered to meet with any MSPs to discuss these issues further. Whilst others have made contact, Mr Halcro Johnston has not taken up this offer.ldquoFollowing calls for further regulation, we formed the Electricians Working Group to bring the industry together and attempt to build consensus for a way forward.ldquoAn independent analysis of research, leading to a risk assessment and business case on the way forward, is due to be presented to the Scottish Government later in March."},{"url":null,"title":"we-are-f-says-official-report-on-impact-of-brexit-on-rural-scotland","story":"A document published by Scottish Rural Actionfeatured a side banner on page four with the statement.It was one of a number of banners attributed to participants in a workshop which asked them to imagine what newspaper headlines they might expect to see after Brexit.Amanda Burgauer, SRA chairwoman, said that the exercise had been used as an ldquoicebreaker and that several of the participants had used ldquoearthy language in describing their feelings towards Brexit.The comments are only explained on the following page, saying they had been put forward by those taking part in the workshop event.Ms Burgauer said that she would flag up the ldquodesign and layout issue with the SRA design team.The Scottish Government has said that although the SRA report was funded through its Brexit Stakeholder Fund, it had no editorial role.The report will be launched at an SRA event with cabinet secretaries Mike Russell and Richard Lochhead in Elgin on Monday.Its findings also detailed the potential impact of Brexit on rural Scotland, suggesting that it could lead to ldquost century clearances, with a loss of freedom of movement resulting in signicant depopulation.Further concerns raised in the report, taken from conversations with rural communities, also included the risk of EU funding being lost post-Brexit and potential damage to social cohesion.Speaking about the report overall, Ms Burgauer said: ldquoThis report is about giving voice to a rural point of view that is rooted in Scotlandrsquos people and places, rather than its rural industries.She added: ldquoThere is widespread anger and frustration across rural Scotland, but that anger isnrsquot solely about Brexit.ldquoIt was clear from workshop discussions that Brexit is compounding long standing concerns about rural equity and fragility.ldquoBrexit was described as the lsquostraw that breaks rural Scotlandrsquos backrsquo, with people pointing to structural fragilities across rural communities.ldquoParticipants generally believed that an historic over-reliance on EU funding to lsquoprop uprsquo rural areas makes rural Scotland particularly exposed to future loss of EU support.Speaking ahead of the reportrsquos launch, Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell said: ldquoThe Scottish Government is committed to ensuring the voices of rural communities are heard and I commend Scottish Rural Action for the work it has done to achieve this.ldquoThe findings in this report are stark.

Staff behave like people who are happy at work.: Pasha, North Frederick Street, Glasgow. Restaurant review by Ron MackennaNominally a ldquoside dish at a mere pound., this intelligently composed winter salad of bitter chicory, peppery rocket, and walnuts that taste freshly toasted, all tossed in a Stilton vinaigrette, is just what I fancy. We marvel at the ldquosmall plate of mussels. Its pound. tag is deceptive. Itrsquos enough for lunch, an ample bowlful of bivalves, plump, fleshy specimens, in a thick Asian soup thatrsquos not for wimps, a thicker version of Indian rasam, aromatic with lime leaf, cinnamon bark, cloves, star anise, and just a hint of sweetness to round it off. Therersquos also a blisteringly hot flatbread to dunk into it. It tears away in circular strands, a bit like a Malaysian roti cenai. Heaps of effort is packed into this dish, yet itrsquos inexpensive.Hake, a special on todayrsquos menu, is a pleasure to behold, a steak cut from the centre of a well-proportioned specimen impeccably grilled under its cape of green herbs. Wild garlic scent wafts up from the plate. It twines around roasted slices of purple potato, which have that rewarding, elusive flavour and floury texture thatrsquos now such a rarity because these characteristics have been bred out of modern ldquomultipurpose commercial potato ieties. Squash pureacutee adds a brightening dash of orange to the opalescence of the fish, setting off the emerald garlic leaves, and the muted imperial purple of the potatoes.The fishcake is also made with hake, and once again, we taste Stravaiginrsquos very evident proficiency with the use of spice. Its innards have the hue of brown crab meat, I guess from a fresh-made curry paste, which lends sharp backbone, perhaps from tomato, with the earthy undertow of turmeric. The necessary oiliness of its breadcrumb jacket is offset by juicy ribs of crunchy, refreshing pak choi that have had a fleeting visit to a searingly hot wok. A runny-yolked poached egg, and satiny, coriander-speckled Hollandaise layer, add wanton enrichment to the already satisfying fish.We catch up with the plum frangipane tart in a just-out-the-oven state. Its thick, yet barely cooked centre, rather like liquid marzipan with opulent dark plums bleeding into it, is only just bound by a taut corset of gloriously buttery, almost butterscotch pastry. This paragon of patisserie perfection is partnered beautully by a scoop of toasted almond ice cream, which tastes like essence of the very best Spanish nougat. Apple and olive oil cake from the daily menu hits that bliss point between too hot to eat and freshly baked. Moist within from the oil, and subtly conveying all the grassy, green flavours in it, it really does taste ine. The exterior is an up hill and down dale landscape of biscuity crust and apple chunks. Translucent pools of sharp, punchy green apple compote, and amber caramel, accentuate the winning sweet-sourness of the cake, while lemony cregraveme fraiche ice cream decisively nudges this dessert away from excessive cloyingness.In its own words, Stravaigin has been ldquowandering since  and ldquoshowcasing Scottish produce that isnrsquot tethered to its roots.

Wersquove had enough of that from Theresa May. The can has been kicked down the road so often that you just want to jump on it and flatten the damned thing.This week we go back to the bargaining stage, but we may not even get that. Parliament has been given an extra fortnight for May to preicate, and for the Commons to avoid coming to a consensus.At least the prospect of no deal on Friday might have concentrated minds, like an execution, and forced MPs to seize the reins of power from this battered and friendless Prime Minister.Instead, we have another fortnight to learn what we already know: that MV seems as remote as ever, and Theresa May wonrsquot give up on it.The European Unionrsquos political leaders were, of course, acting in their own best interests on Thursday. Having listened to May ramble on incoherently for  minutes, the  concluded that, yes, she really is daft enough to let a no-deal Brexit happen.Well, they can live with thatthey have to. But what they werenrsquot prepared to do is allow her to blame the European Union for the breakdown so, to coin a phrase, they took back control.The heads of government offered to delay the Brexit deadline until May ,she gets her deal through Parliament, or April she doesnrsquot. They will go the extra mile, explore all options, and then even offer a longer extensionall  fails. Itrsquos jaw-jaw not war-war, and they are the virtuosos of jaw-jaw.Though in truth, Brussels doesnrsquot really know what happens when the talking finally ends.The problem with the European Union is that they expect political leaders to behave as rational agents, who seek the most advantageous outcome. They donrsquot have protocols to deal with mad-as-a-hatter prime ministers and a parliament that has lost the plot.The UK has decided to have a collective mental breakdown, in full technicolour, and will not be talked out of it by boring bureaucrats with their seemingly sensible solutions.After , days, the simple fact is that UK still doesnrsquot know what Brexit means. That image of the cat manically scratching at the door, and then refusing to leave when itrsquos opened, is only too apt.Everyone knows that the obvious destination for a country like Britain, which has vital trading links with Europe but doesnrsquot want to be part of the political union, is to join the European Economic Area, now dubbed ldquoCommon Market ..That alone allows friction-free trade, avoids an Irish border and halts these daft, wartime preparations for no deal. .There has always been a majority in Parliament for soft Brexit, everyone says so. But as I pointed out last week, our system seems incapable of distilling compromise from the mash of party interests.MPs say they want to reach across party boundaries, but as last weekrsquos walkouts and tetchy letters confirmed, they donrsquot really. No-one wants to take any responsibility, no one wants to blink first, no-one wants to make the first step.Yet to halt Theresa Mayrsquos Thelma and Louise-style drive to the clf edge, ministers and MPs will have to remove her from office, probably through a confidence motion, and set up a kind of provisional government.They need to force the long delay she refuses to contemplate. This weekrsquos indicative votes on their own wonrsquot cut it. The nightmare, indeed, is that nothing gets a majority.The Westminster system requires a semi-dictatorial Prime Minister, with an unassailable majority, to . But May is a dictator without an army. She has no majority, yet perversely behaves asshe still has one.What residue of authority she possessed evaporated after her petulant outburst against MPs on Wednesday. Even Labour MPs who were tempted to vote for her deal, like Lisa Nandy, were so outraged that they resolved to vote against her come what may.What can you do with a Prime Minister who wilfully alienates her potential allies Theresa May actually had a point about Parliament only being able to agree on what it doesnrsquot want. We all thought that the problem was the Withdrawal Agreement, the -page legal document signed off by May last year, which contained the infamous Irish backstop. But we now know that this is not the case.Last week, Labour declared that they did not have any problems with the Withdrawal Agreement or the backstop, despite Jeremy Corbyn having condemned it in November. He said then that Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement was ldquoa half-baked deal which Britain cannot leave, and the backstop would deny Britain ldquothe sovereign right of any UK parliament to unilaterally withdraw from any backstop.All Labour now wants is a tweak to the Political Declaration ndash that non-binding, non-legal compendium of cliches, aspiration and wishful thinking that accompanied the Withdrawal Agreement. I seem to remember writing that to say this was woolly would be an insult to sheep. So why has it become a deal-breaker The blame obviously lies principally with the Prime Minister ndash a woman so bereft of vision and leadership ability that she shouldnrsquot be left in charge of a milk float, let alone a country.She could have offered Labour anything they wanted: full consultation, customs union, workers rights, environmental standards, regulatory alignment. It would have meant little because the Political Declaration is non-binding. Instead, she has made a fetish of inflexibility which is the worst failing in a political leader. She is in love with her idea of herself as a ldquobloody dficult woman, and thinks that backing down, resiling, is a betrayal of her sex.That is why I ended up voting for the petition to Revoke Article . To my horror, I found myself agreeing with Nigel Farage and Michael Portillo that the only real choice,Parliament cannot act, is between no deal and no Brexit.The only certain way to end this horror show is to pull the plug, halt the madness and pretend the last three years never happened. EvenParliament does end up backing Mayrsquos deal, which of course is still possible, it wonrsquot put an end to this nightmare.The Withdrawal Agreement is only the start. It deals with citizenship, the orce bill and the Irish backstop. Negotiations over Britainrsquos future trading relations with the EU have yet to begin, and will take two to four years. Four more years of this would be beyond endurance.And it wonrsquot be Theresa May who is doing the negotiating, but perhaps Boris Johnson, or some other Tory leader. If voters were fully aware of this fact, Irsquom sure that the parliamentary petition calling for Article  to be revoked would top  million within the week."},{"url":null,"title":"how-orkney-reinvented-the-future-with-hydrogen","story":"ldquoIn , it said, ldquoOrkney was the first to generate hydrogen from tidal power, using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Actor, environmentalist and hydrogen-advocate Leonardo DiCaprio shared that video on Instagram. It has been viewed , times. The world had its eyes on little Orkney as a possible beacon of low-carbon hope.It is not the first time Orkney has been there first or best. Back in , the first grid-connected wind turbine was erected in buffeting gales at Costa Head. In , a giant experimental concrete turbine, the largest of its kind, was inaugurated on Burgar Hill. Orkney was where, in , the European Marine Energy Centreinstalled Scotlandrsquos first grid-connected tidal device, and last year, a flagship tidal energy turbine generated more electricity in its first year than the whole of Scotlandrsquos wave and tidal sector produced before it.The carbon intensity of the electricity that Orkney generates and feeds into the main grid is almost the lowest anywhere in the world, at just g CO kWh. Only El Hierro, in the Canary Islands, beats it.Hydrogen is Orkneyrsquos latest possible game-changer. New projects on the islands are fitting ferries to run on the gas, which is produced from local renewables.Hydrogen boiler heating systems are being fitted into a primary school. Orkney Islands Council, a signicant force in the developments, is running a fleet of hydrogen-fuelled vans.A key player in these changes is the wave and tidal test and research centre, EMEC. Its hydrogen manager Jon Clipsham says that a favourite phrase at the centre is ldquothe art of the possible.ldquoWith these projects wersquove proved itrsquos possible, he says. ldquoIt also has to happen. If it doesnrsquot wersquove got nothing to hand over to the next generations, because Irsquom more than of the opinion that the climate is changing, and quite rapidly now.What is it about these islands  Partly, of course, itrsquos the climate and location itself ndash the rapid tidal currents that run through its sounds, the constant winds. Itrsquos also that for decades it struggled with the fact that it is an island, connected to the mainland electricity by an undersea cable, and suffers the worst fuel poverty in the UK ndash partially caused by being off the gas grid and stuck with one of the highest rates for grid electricity.Hydrogen technology has developed in Orkney, in part, because the islands had a problem.This archipelago with its now more than  wind turbines and developing tidal renewables was generating too much electricity for its own needs ndash it now produces the equivalent of % of its electricity demand ndash and wasnrsquot able to send more down the line to the grid.The cable connecting to the mainland could only carry a small fraction of what it was generating.Communities had erected wind turbines but were not seeing the expected revenue s, and were having their generation curtailed, some to just % of what they could generate. So great is the problem that currently there is a moratorium on further wind development.Clipsham says: ldquoThe huge expansion in renewable energy led to a point where there was more energy being produced than we could feed back through the cable to the mainland. That meant those who had invested in wind technologies were unable to get the revenue they were looking for.This was particularly frustrating, says Clipsham, because the sheer abundance of natural wind and tide resource on the islands meant ldquoyou could deploy  times, possibly more, of it than what wersquove currently deployed.Community groups had bought in to the idea of using the feed-in tarfs as a means of generating revenue for projects and services but werenrsquot seeing the expected payback. A further issue is that while Orkney is host to incredible renewables potential, the communities also suffer the worst fuel poverty in the UK. A factor in this is that there is no gas grid on Orkney and the electrical supply can cost as much as p per kWh, making it among the highest in the UK.The Orkney community was looking to find answers to these problems and, around seven years ago, EMEC began to look at using the renewables technology to make hydrogen by electrolysis. ldquoEMEC has always been very future-focused, says Jon Clipsham, ldquoand hydrogen is not new. Itrsquos been around for a long, long time. Iceland had a boom-and-bust cycle. But we began to look at it.ldquoThoughts of how we need to decarbonise the world were very present. By  , things had really some momentum and we decided to go for hydrogen.The first project was Surf rsquonrsquo Turf, a wind and tidal energy project that was all about grid balancing, in which energy was harvested when it couldnrsquot be put into the grid, stored, and regenerated as electricity when there was the opportunity to export it.However, it was quickly recognised that the hydrogen could also be used as a fuel. ldquoThe premise, says Clipsham, ldquoshted from grid balancing to setting us off on the journey which we are now well advanced with, towards having a fledged hydrogen economy.As part of EMECrsquos European Union and Scottish Government-funded Big Hit project, hydrogen heating boilers are being fitted in a school on the Orkney island of Shapinsay. Meanwhile, a car ferry is under construction which will run on hydrogen, and this year will see the installation of a hydrogen system into one of the ferries currently running between Shapinsay and Kirkwall.Such technological development seems timely. In December last year, Maersk, the worldrsquos largest container shipping company, announced it aimed to be carbon neutral by  ndash currently it is looking at biofuels.Clipsham is interested in how these hydrogen and renewables technologies might scale up or be adapted in dferent locations. ldquoCan the learnings we got here be transitioned  Yes. Energy systems are becoming increasingly decentralised, so yoursquore breaking things down into smaller chunks, so you might see some of the knowledge wersquove gained on Orkney rolled out and used on a block of flats, or a housing estate or a leisure centre.There is a sense on the island right now that what they are doing is being watched. Steven Bews, a builder who grew up on Shapinsay where the Big Hit project is based, is, as chair of Shapinsay Development Trust, involved in his community turbinersquos integration in the project. ldquoWe do feel a wee bit like the whole world is looking at us, he says. ldquoI keep seeing it on social media. Orkney and the Big Hit project is being highlighted and itrsquos good to see that the wider world is aware of us.For Bews, the idea that he is getting to be part of a greener future is as important as the local benefits. ldquoTherersquos a feeling that you are being environmentally friendly in what yoursquore doing. Yoursquore trying to lever the whole industry away from carbon and on to renewable green energy ndash and while it is in its infancy, I believe hydrogen has the potential to eventually replace a diesel and hydrocarbon-thirsty transport infrastructure.The awareness of climate change is strong on the islands. Almost everyone has some story to tell of its impact. Adele Lidderdale, hydrogen project officer at Orkney Islands Council, observes: ldquoYou see crop failure. We had flooding over the past  years that we didnrsquot previously see. We know the impact that the environment can have on day-to-day le.Lidderdale, whose great grandfather came from Orkney, grew up on the islands. Her husband grew up on Shapinsay, where one of the key hydrogen projects is based. ldquoWhen yoursquore in such a small community you see the impact first hand. You have to answer to the community. I think thatrsquos part of the unique mixture of why wersquore able to get these things done. You know that yoursquore going to have to answer to the people who are going to be affected by any decisions you make.Part of the appeal of the Orkney hydrogen project is that it shows on a small, very human scale, how hydrogen could become part of the answer in a low-carbon future. Nigel Holmes, chief executive of the Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association, sees great promise in what is happening on the islands.ldquoOrkney is almost like a microcosm of some of the things we are trying to tackle. We can show how we make the hydrogen from renewables, we can move it around, we can store it. We can show how it can be used in transport. We can show it can be used for making power, also for heating. The project helps people to appreciate the interconnected nature of some of these networks ndash because itrsquos all there in one place.Clipsham has watched the project develop and believes that one of the key things about the Orkney Islands is the people. ldquoPeople are starting to ask, lsquoWhy is all this going on in the Orkney Islands  Yoursquove got , people, but theyrsquove now got a portfolio of about  million euros of hydrogen related projects happening.rsquo And thatrsquos a very good question.ldquoBut when you go to the Orkney Islands and you talk to some of them, you realise why. Because there is such a positive can-do attitude. If you give them a problem they will work out what they can do to find a solution. Andit isnrsquot obvious theyrsquoll go out and look for it. There is an absolutely amazing attitude up there."},{"url":null,"title":"si-ferry-talks-football-in-our-latest-cool-conversations","story":"A le less ordinary: Partick Thistle director Jacqui Low talks politics, bereavement and smashing the glass ceilingIt helps that Ferry is a former footballer and that some of the people he interviews are just his mates, people he might chat with anyway.

Backed by funding from Scottish Natural Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the project will involve a ldquobee census and DNA testing to establish the sustainability of the remaining gene pool.The Trust said while the species was unlikely to disappear within a few years, it may have ldquojust decades left due to the tiny number of bees left in the harsh environment of the Highlands.One of  species of bumblebee in the UK, the distribution of the great yellow has declined by  per cent since , making it one of the rarest in the country.ldquoThey are very distinctive and very beautul.

And in Glasgow the taxpayer has to pay pound a week ndash thats pound a calendar month ndash for the privilege.Solicitors, charities and politicians have today called for the government to open its eyes to the scandal affecting the countryrsquos homeless population and have accused those in power of squandering taxpayers cash while keeping the most vulnerable in poverty.The director of Scotlandrsquos largest housing charity, Shelter, said the situation was due to ldquodecades of underinvestment in social housing.Residents are provided with a room, a bed, a kettle and a wardrobe. In some cases they have their own bathrooms, while in others they have to share a communal one in the corridor. In one BB, residents were forbidden from talking to each other or going to each otherrsquos rooms, while in another the doors were locked at midnight and anyone not back by then would be out for the night.Cooking facilities were rare, and in most cases residents lived on non-perishables such as instant noodles, biscuits and junk food.For the money costs to be accommodate in these places ndash pound a month ndash an \"impressive drawing room conversion\" is advertised for rent in the heart of Glasgows west end.The flat in an \"elegant sandstone townhouse\" comes with a modern kitchen, mezzanine, \"stylish\" two-piece bathroom and separate toilet, and is \"exceptionally well-placed for local amenities and excellent transport links\".And for less than that, pound a month, a two-bedroom semi-detached mews is available for rent, including council tax bills.The \"elegant\" property is also in the west end of Glasgow, and boasts two large bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom and access to a garden.In Bearsden, a three-bedroom refurbished villa is on the market for just pound a month.This, they say, is only adding to or creating more problems in terms of mental health issues, addiction, isolation and unemployment.Lorna Walker, a partner at Govan Law Centre, said: ldquoThis isnt the best use of taxpayers money, when they could be putting it in to accommodation that is of a decent standard and putting it in to helping people get their lives back on track the way they want it.\"It is not a good way for taxpayersrsquo money to be spent at all and the authorities need to open their eyes and see that.ldquoThe law in Scotland on this issue is some of the best ndash it is very clearly written, and it is clear how it should be applied. Unfortunately, it isnrsquot working in that way.Ms Walker added that many of her clients are keen to get back to work, but as they are unable to afford to pay the extortionate pound-per-month rent and try to save for a deposit for their own homes, they are stuck in a ldquovicious cycle.She said: ldquoUnless you are on a great wage, itrsquos a lot of money to pay. Itrsquos more than most peoplersquos mortgages.ldquoPeople may be stuck there for months and sometimes years, and itrsquos a vicious cycle ndash they lose skills, they become isolated, they dont make relationships.ldquoWe have clients who have been in these places for years, or people who may have been in one then moved to another and another, theres no support to get them into a flat.He explained: ldquoWhile the cost can be high, it is what we must pay to ensure people have somewhere to live when they are homeless.ldquoThese are the consequences of decades of underinvestment in social housing.Annie Wells, Scottish Conservative MSP for Glasgow said: ldquoThese revelations expose an extremely poor standard of living for those housed in these places. Itrsquos simply not good enough, either for the vulnerable people living there or the taxpayer.ldquoHow can we expect homeless people to get their lives back on track when theyrsquore being left in such unacceptable conditions Labour housing spokeswoman Pauline McNeill said: \"This is simply scandalous but it wont be fixed until we end Scotlands housing crisis.\"The government need to be much better at preventative work and stopping people getting to this point in the first place.\"That means properly resourcing public services, looking at how we can make the private rented sector more affordable and preventing evictions, as well as building more homes for social rent.\"Current legislation on breaching suitable accommodation must be properly enforced and responded to ndash that simply is not happening now.\"Glasgow City Council said: ldquoThis is a national issue, and it should be noted that the charges for this type of accommodation go to support the whole homelessness system and the charges levied reflect the overall costs of the service.\"The charges are iniably met from Housing Benefit, which is paid for by the UK Government.ldquoWe are implementing the Housing First programme which will see people given permanent accommodation with appropriate support at the first time of asking."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-in-the-eye-of-the-storm","story":"It might as well have devastated the dark side of the moon for all the attention it has been given. But then itrsquos in Africa, isnrsquot it  These things happen there, have done before and doubtless will again, so whatrsquos new If I had the proverbial pound for every time such cynical responses have crossed my path after ing home from covering humanitarian crises across the African subcontinent and where these past decades, then the needy coffers of aid agencies would be better off right now.It was late on Thursday, March  when Cyclone Idai made landfall off the coast of Mozambique, before hurtling itrsquos gargantuan wrecking ball of mph winds, rain and floods into Zimbabwe and Malawi, causing devastation across swathes of all three countries.What Idai left in its wake has been described as perhaps the worst weather-related disaster ever to hit the southern hemisphere. Already the United Nations World Food Programmehas declared the flood crisis a level three emergency, putting it in the same bracket with Yemen, Syria and South Sudan.In terms of its impact for the estimated . million people caught up in this maelstrom, it meant storm surges of up to  feet deep, creating on the Mozambican coast what BBC reporter Fergal Keane flying over the area by helicopter called an ldquoinland sea.For tens of thousands it has meant being trapped by floods, landslides, flattened homes and flooded communities, with crops, roads and electricity supplies wiped away. More than , people needed emergency evacuation in the Mozambican port city of Beira alone where the cyclone made landfall. Some initial reports estimate that % of Beira, Mozambiquersquos fourth-largest city, with more than , residents, may be damaged or destroyed. Without electricity Beira has found itself in the dark and has become a ghost town at night.Many in Beira and where were stuck on rooftops or on tiny islands of land surrounded by water with no food, clean drinking water or shelter. There have been cases of women with babies trapped in trees and other lucky survivors pulled from neck-deep water.As ever in such situations, many of those worst affected were already the poorest of the poor, susceptible to hunger and disease even before Idai dealt them such another cruel blow.ldquoThis will have the worst impact on those most vulnerable, says Caroline Rose, Medecins Sans Frontieres head of mission in Mozambique.ldquoItrsquos those who have small, fragile houses that are worst impacted, as they are always the people without the means to build a new house. So itrsquos a vicious cycle.ldquoThose who have no means to rebuild will be left outside with no house, more at risk of disease and worse off.Aid organisations are of one voice in stressing that itrsquos now a race against the clock to prevent an even worse catastrophe emerging through the spread of disease.ldquoWe are running out of time, it is at a critical point here, warned the United Nations childrenrsquos agencychief Henrietta Fore on Friday.ldquoTherersquos stagnant water, itrsquos not draining, decomposing bodies, lack of good hygiene and sanitation, Fore said. ldquoWe are worried about cholera, about malaria, because of the stagnant water.As ever, humanitarians will have their work cut out harnessing the collective concern of a world that has so far been disproportionately low.As ever too, those cynics will chant their now familiar mantra about it being far away in Africa and how ldquocharity begins at home.To those among such people I would simply ask this. Imagine, just imagine, waking up tomorrow and the sense of desperation you would feel were your own children confronted with the same horrors so many in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi face right now How dferent the callous attitudes of such cynics might be were they, even momentarily, to eyewitness such suffering for themselves up close.The chaos, pain, helplessness, hunger and disease of such disasters are not an easy thing to confront face on and forget. The juxtaposition with the comparative safety and luxury so many of us take for granted here would also be a real shock to the sensibility of many.I well recall many years ago when the impact of climate change was dismissed more readily than it is now, ing from Ethiopia where millions were caught in the grip of drought and impending famine.It was just days before Christmas when I set foot back in Glasgow. The conspicuous consumption of that time of year stood in grotesque marked contrast to a village where I had been just a few days before, watching vultures circling above a community where people were already badly malnourished and some had died of hunger.ldquoWe call them the undertaker birds, one elderly local man told me, bringing home the terrible resignation so many people feel towards their fate when faced with such helplessness.Idairsquos angry arrival in Africa was yet another ominous sign for a continent already bearing the brunt of climate change. How tragically ironic it was that the cyclone made landfall on precisely the same day that the One Planet Summit, called by French president Emmanuel Macron, opened in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. In the same week too as Idai caused unimaginable levels of devastation, the Africa Climate Week conference got under way in Accra, Ghana.No doubt delegates at both conferences were again reminded that while Africa is responsible for only % of global greenhouse-gas emissions, climate change is considered to directly impact % of the African population.Those in any doubt that Africa is the continent that pays the highest price for this need only have tuned into breaking news reports of Idairsquos arrival to be reminded of what this means for millions of people.As environmental journalist Landry Ninteretse who leads the campaigning organisation Africa  has pointed out, for Africans ldquoclimate change is not a future risk, itrsquos already a reality evident in wrecked families, lands and livelihoods, and hopeless children and young people who have no choice but to seek a future by migrating.Perhaps those same cynics who complain about foreign aid and the ldquodeluge of migrants Europe faces should pause and consider this unrelenting impact of climate change. This, after all, is one of the prime reasons why so many of those plucked out of the seas or who drown trying to reach Europe are from the African subcontinent.Somewhere down the line you can be sure that Cyclone Idai and other disasters will send more on such perilous journeys.As Ninteretse says, Idai is just the latest reminder that everywhere on the African continent communities fear losing their land as each season hits one country after another with exceptional floods, unexpected storms and increasingly long droughts.It goes without saying thata tragedy of such gargantuan proportions as Idai occurred in the Western or ldquodeveloped world, then the response would be very dferent. Two vast cyclones named Trevor and Veronica are currently bearing down on the north coast of Australia and thousands have evacuated their homes in preparation for these two potentially devastating storms.Not for a moment to dismiss the suffering, destruction and potential loss of le these cyclones will bring to Australians, but itrsquos almost a certainty we will hear much more about their impact there than what has occurred in Africa this past week.Some will argue that it has always be thus, that there has been a huge disparity between how we handle humanitarian crises close to home or those that affect ldquorecognisable locations and how we process disasters that occur where.Butthere is one thing that the cycle of climate change and migration has shown us itrsquos that such humanitarian concerns are inextricably connected and transnational in nature affecting us all in one way or another wherever we might be.There are those who will argue that we cannot be sure that the likes of Idai was caused by climate change. But global experts agree that climate change certainly made it worse and point to three factors.First, warmer air temperatures mean more rain is held and then released. Idai produced nearly a yearrsquos worth of rain in just a few days, more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change.As Unicef chief Henrietta Fore has pointed out, the water that has arrived has not drained. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, which has also increased the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges such as those that engulfed the port city of Beira creating that ldquoinland sea are about a foot higher than a century ago having been fed by melting ice at the poles.ldquoCyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns, said Mami Mizutori, the UNrsquos special representative for disaster risk reduction.For the moment though, on the ground, current relief efforts in coping with Idai ldquoare nowhere near the scale and magnitude of the problem, according to Elhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.ldquoThe situation is simply horrendous. There is no other way to describe it, As Sy said after touring camps in Mozambique.ldquoThree thousand people who are living in a school that has  classrooms and six, only six, toilets. You can imagine how much we are sitting on a water and sanitation ticking bomb, he added, expressing the fear of many aid workers that disease is now the biggest threat.In neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi, meanwhile, the situation is also dire. In Zimbabwe, floods have affected an estimated , people, while in Malawi, , people are estimated displaced and , have been affected, according to the government.Across all three countries, many regions remain inaccessible and the death toll has now topped more than , but is almost certain to soar in the coming days.For aid agencies, access to potable drinking water, shelter, food, and healthcare are the priorities, they say, with water, sanitation and hygiene needs particularly urgent as the risk of waterborne diseases is the major concern across the board.ldquoIn Beira, we fear a huge cholera outbreak soon, said Caroline Rose of Medecins Sans Frontieres.ldquoThe main challenges will be getting treatment for people who donrsquot understand they have cholera, and that itrsquos urgent, or people who are not reachable, or people who cannot reach health centres, Rose confirmed.The arrival of Idai has once again brought home with devastating force issues and questions that affect us all.It has reminded us of the prevailing view among some that distant disasters are not our concern.Here in the UK, wersquove barely engaged with what has happened in Mozambique and its neighbours. As for those charity begins at home cynics, I know from long experience that their voices are those of the minority and by contrast the vast majority of ordinary people dig deep in their pockets and hearts when confronted by the suffering of their fellow human beings.Above all, Cyclone Idai has brought home again why we can no longer ignore the impact of climate change.In October , the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction released a report that highlighted the staggering financial impact of climate-related disasters.In the period  , disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses of , billion of which climate-related disasters accounted for ,bn or  % of the total.Itrsquos a staggering figure and no, itrsquos not just in Africa and where that such an impact will be felt. As those among our younger generation have admirably been highlighting for weeks now in their school protests across the world, climate change is something that affects every one of us.

Jeremy Corbyn demands a no-holds-barred, no-red-lines, meeting with the Prime Minister after PMQs this week. Ms May concurs. At the emergency meeting he demanded, Jeremy Corbyn walks out because, among all the other factions and parties attending the meeting, there were representatives of the Labour MPs who had left his party.You could not make this up. It is symptomatic of the whole Brexit paralysis. Factional politics, obsessive, one-issue nationalism, huffs and grudges against others on your own side, they all far outweigh what is best for the country as a whole.Alexander McKayEdinburghNicola Sturgeon frequently informs us Westminster is ignoring Scotlands views re Brexit. Really The big picture reason behind the UK constitutional crisis regarding Brexit is that the House of Commons is at odds with public opinion across the UK. The majority of the British public narrowly voted Leave in June  whereas a definite majority of MPs support our staying in the EU.The majority will in the Commons is for us to remain in the EU, meaning free movement of goods, services and people - the very position the majority in Scotland voted for and the SNP claim to support.Martin RedfernEdinburghIts time for Scotland to make a choiceI am an octogenarian, right-of-centre socialist.

I listen to people denigrating fellow Europeans and boasting of how the British Empire once ruled the world, conveniently forgetting darker side of that philosophy ndash exploitation, subjugation, engaging in foreign battles ... the list goes on.Apart from removing ourselves from the biggest, richest market in the world, there is a real risk that Brexit could nully years of peace in Europe.

Renewable hydrogen would not only satisfy all our domestic energy needs, but it could also be exported. Until now itrsquos been impossible to properly store and export green energy.The Scottish economist and scientist who head up the new HIAlba-Idea think tank say Scotland could effectively fuel the proposed European supergrid, and generate so much money for the economy that the nation could establish a Sovereign Wealth Fund, as Norway did with North Sea oil. The UK failed to set up such a fund.HIAlba-Idea, the first think tank based in the Highlands, is run by the economist Professor Ronald MacDonald, and the mathematician, scientist and engineer Dr Donald MacRae. MacDonald is professor of macroeconomics at Glasgow Universityrsquos Adam Smith Business School. He has been a consultant adviser to the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the World Bank, the IMF and the UK National Audit Office. MacRae has held under-secretary positions in the Australian government and was a director with Australiarsquos Commonwealth Scientic and Industrial Research Organisation .MacRaersquos work with CSIRO is key to the blueprints which the think tank is releasing tomorrow ndash called Hydrogen Scotland: A Route to Export Powerhouse and Maximising Scotlandrsquos Wellbeing While Bravely Innovating. Australia has started to use solar power to develop renewable hydrogen.Hydrogen can be produced using solar, wave or wind power, and can then be used as a cheap, clean, plentul energy source, and exported for the first time. Some have described the process as bottling sunshine and wind.The new technology is being hailed as the solution to many of the Westrsquos environmental, economic and social problems. MacDonald says the energy revolution would solve the ldquotail-off in productivity of the Scottish and UK economy, which came about with the sht from manufacturing to services.Renewable hydrogen is ldquothe big transformative idea, he says, which would ldquotake us back to being a manufacturing economy and an export power house. He added: ldquoThe revolution is having this cheap, storable and transportable energy. MacRae called it ldquoa game-changer.MacDonald believes renewable hydrogen could lead to a ldquoHighland renaissance as many of the wind farms needed to create the new energy source would be located in the most rural parts of the country.Renewable hydrogen ldquocould easily equal the whole production of North Sea oil in terms of its potential benefits to the UK and Scotland, said MacDonald. ldquoWe could set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund as the Norwegians have done.While Scotland ndash and Orkney in particular ndash are making good progress with the technology, Australia has already created a ldquoroadmap for commercial use of renewable hydrogen. South Korea plans to convert its ,-strong fleet of buses to hydrogen, and Australia is eyeing the market for exports. Japan is also moving toward the use of more hydrogen vehicles.HIAlba-Idea is calling on the Holyrood Government and the big players in the oil industry, who want to move away from carbons to green energy, to work with them to create a Scottish roadmap. Norway is also starting to explore the exploitation of renewable hydrogen.With Europe ldquodesperate for energy independence, says MacRae, Scotland would be well placed to export renewable hydrogen to the continent.MacDonald said: ldquoClearly, a Europe self-sufficient in green energy would have implications that go beyond decarbonisation, including that of its security, since it would no longer need to be reliant on potentially hostile countries for its energy supplies.MacRae added: ldquoYou can imagine an energy-independent Europe, through power generated by Scotland going into a supergrid.He proposes storing green energy ndash it would be kept as ammonia, from which the hydrogen is extracted ndash on decommissioned North Sea oil rigs among forests of floating wind farms.MacDonald and MacRae say thatthe new industry is handled properly by the Government, Scotland could also become a centre for manufacturing and exporting the equipment and technology associated with renewable hydrogen, as well as a global hub for the financial services needed to fund it.ldquoFor Scotland, said MacRae, ldquoit has the potential to be a very signicant game-changer. In fact, there are so many innovations that spin off it that we are actually looking at it as a whole portfolio of opportunities. For Scotland, we are talking about something of immense signicance.MacDonald added: ldquoThe exciting part is the transformative effect on society and the economy. This is a breakthrough which could transcend anything  we are doing, thatrsquos how important it is.He added that the impact on global warming would be ldquoenormous. ldquoScotland on its own being completely carbon-free would probably make some impact, but it would be quite small. Butthe supergrid became a reality then that in itself could be revolutionary. This could be the pathway to making the whole of Europe green. He feels it would not be long before green supergrids spread across the globe.If Scotland took a lead in renewable hydrogen, the global clout that came with that would be ldquophenomenal.The HIAlba-Idea vision is that Scotland becomes one of the largest global energy exporters in the world ... through the low-cost extraction of hydrogen from renewably generated ammonia used as a storage medium and carrier of hydrogen.The think tank says: ldquoOffshore ammonia production on disused oil rigs serving offshore wind farms could be stored for periods of low wind. In this way, the continuous production of renewable electricity is guaranteed.In its ldquo vision for energy, the Scottish Government did look at the role of hydrogen in the national energy mix. ldquoHowever, it neither envisions it as a major export industry nor considers the role of renewable ammonia in achieving this outcome, it notes.The renewable energy entrepreneur Eddie OrsquoConnor is advocating a single European energy market connected by a supergrid. ldquoAn interconnected energy market based on renewable energy linked by a supergrid will deliver cheap power to consumers and enable us all to meet our climate goals, he said.KELP, HEMP AND PLASTIC-EATING SHIPS: THE OTHER BIG IDEASFOR THE SCOTTISH ECONOMY IN THE ST CENTURYA GREEN energy revolution is just the biggest idea on the table when it comes to the future of the Scottish economy.Professor Ronald MacDonald and his colleague Dr Donald MacRae have some other revolutionary plans, including autonomous self-fuelled ships. These would clean up plastic in the oceans and turn the waste into a biofuel produced onboard. This would power the ships - and be pollution free.Seaweed could also be the crop of the future, with a growing market in the world for kelp, including vegan foods, beer, healthcare products, eco-friendly packaging and cosmetics.The use of off-shore rigs for the production of renewable hydrogen could also stimulate the seaweed industry. HIAlba-Idea suggests lsquooperating large-scale seaweed harvesting operations in conjunction with disused oil rigs and associated offshore wind farms established for offshore ammonia productionrsquo.lsquoSteel cables strung between wind turbine mountings and disused oil rigs [could] provide an ideal seaweed growing and harvesting zone.rsquoWith crofts working to run wind farms and the renewable hydrogen sector, farms would have the money to use lsquodrones and robotised farming practicesrsquo. Hemp - now seen as a superfood - could be grown on crofts and sold globally as hemp oil, hemp chocolate and hemp milk.If rural areas are able to grow in wealth, the University of the Highlands and Islands could establish mini-campuses in burgeoning communities - increasing the population and economy."},{"url":null,"title":"school-league-tables-comment-this-is-not-the-true-measure-of-our-schools","story":"Each year I get upset about them on behalf of all the headteachers and teachers across the city who work so hard to ensure that Glasgowrsquos young people achieve regardless of their background.As a maths teacher and former HM Inspector, I understand fully the limitations of drawing conclusions from just one statistic.

Yoursquod imagine any passing Yoons risk his wee plastic sword being waved at them.Was Max mad SCIENTIST Max Planck, much-lauded midwe to the wild weirdness of quantum physics, believed consciousness was the universersquos fundamental element and that all matter derived from it.The rough gist of his musings certainly foreshadowed the mathematical swoon of string theory, which poetically describes all matter being formed by the musical vibrations of minuscule ldquostrings. These canrsquot be bought at Victor Morris ndash rather, they are the ldquoguts of quarks and leptons, the fundamental building blocks at the root of everything our eyes can perceive.If our bodies are simply just the music of our minds, then it must mean we once had an ldquoessence in the ether, waiting billions of years for evolution so we could invent money, religionand crippling social hierarchies. More importantly, it would also mean that consciousness is not dependent on a brain.This notion sparked the interest of another respected scientist ndash the late astrophysicist Carl Sagan, who caused shockwaves among his peers by suggesting children claiming to be reincarnated deserved further study in his magisterial book The Demon-Haunted World.Dedicating  years of hisle to such endeavour at the University of Virginia is Dr James Tucker. Despite compiling more than , cases on the subject of reincarnation, however, Tucker is still not % sold ndash simply describing his work as ldquoquite compelling.Plastic pollutionONE of Dr Tuckerrsquos highest-profile studies was that of wee James Leininger from Louisiana, a three-year-old who seemed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after recalling details of his fiery death as a Second World War pilot.Although a potential ldquomatch was found, it was later revealed that the lad had been obsessed with toy aircraft ndash and, vitally, the plane he remembered was not actually on the victimrsquos aircraft carrier. Proving, perhaps, that plastic depictions of weaponry can be more a threat to the developing minds of children than iPads.If wee Jamesrsquos imaginative story had checked out, however, would this then prove reincarnation  Well, researchers would likely have never considered the possibility James may have travelled back in time and watched the crash for himself. Or that the ghost of the pilot materialised in his bedroom to bore him with his le story. Mibbie the wee man had the information implanted in his head during an alien abduction or even left his body and astral travelled to chat with the pilot in Heaven.Such unlikely scenarios are certainly no less credible than the notion we have an eternal soul that quantum leaps through a neverending supply of bodies. Yet, somehow, reincarnation manages to retain a validity that other bizarre supernatural explanations just lack.Other than wishful thinking, itrsquos dficult to see why. The evidence for reincarnation simply cannot hold up to any objective scrutiny. Hypnotism, for example, is certainly not a valid process of obtaining information. It is a highly subjective rummage around the subconscious thatrsquos capable of sparking  memories and mental illness.Similarly, accounts from children cannot be taken as proof. Not only because of the subjective nature of memory but because of positive reinforcement by researchers ndash who more often than not are already believers. Physical quirks such as odd birthmarks are also easily accounted for by natural explanations. Like Columbo said, many pieces of bad evidence do not equal one piece of good.Perhaps itrsquos best we never prove reincarnation, however. Certainly, you wouldnrsquot live long enough to finish an autobiography. No doubt it would also prove lucrative for ancestory, who might be able to track what types of dinosaur we once were. Yet, itrsquos also inevitable the Government would begin mass soul profiling ndash holding us all accountable for past misdemeanours.On a positive note, itrsquos also possible we could inherit great fortunes procured in former lives.You canrsquot take it with you, but perhaps the wealthy elite would choose to fly en masse to Dignitas, their eternal souls chilling out in the afterlersquos executive lounge as their Earthly riches accumulate vast interest. Yes, even death might not stop the rich getting richer.And finally ...THE First Law of Thermodynamics states any energy in the universe cannot be created or destroyed, but simply changes form. To believers in reincarnation, this proves we were all once amoebas, dinosaurs or, perhaps, gaseous blobs floating in acidic clouds on distant planets.All highly unlikely, of course, but scientists do not always dismiss the notion of a separate mind and body out of hand. Planckrsquos theory that consciousness came before the visible universe might initially seem supportive of true believers, but proves problematic under closer scrutiny.Although Planck suggests we are simply part of a single eternal energy source that has since splintered into all biological matter, he leaves the possibility ndash strap yourself in ndash that this ldquoGod has actually not fragmented.Perhaps, free from the constraints of spacetime, this consciousness can fully inhabit every single creature in the universe at the same time, simultaneously experiencing all possible perceptions of its wondrous creation.Andjust one ldquosoul exists, it also means Stephen really was John Lennon. And so was I. And you. Yet, ultimately, were all God. As Lennon himself once sang, ldquoI am you and you are me and we are all together.

Her obsession is stopping Scotland from getting on and doing the things that really matter to people.\"Pamela Nash, Chief Executive of Scotland in Union, added: \"The only thing inevitable in politics is that Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP want to create further ision in society.\"Regardless of what she says about Brexit, the First Ministers priority will always be to break up the United Kingdom.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-too-heavy-for-devolution-to-bear-and-new-constitutional-settlement-needed-says-michael-russell","story":"The Scottish Governmentrsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary in a speech in London to an audience of government officials, business leaders and academics follows a declaration from Nicola Sturgeon that Theresa May is now effectively ldquoout of power and has no way forward on Brexit.In a speech to the Institute for Government think-tank in London, Mr Russell will say: ldquoBrexit has proved too heavy for devolution to bear and therefore a new constitutional settlement will be required should Brexit take place.Read more:Theresa Mays premiership teetering on the brink as she confronts Cabinet plottersFailing that, the Scottish Government minister will argue, Article  should be revoked before the UK leaves the EU to prevent a no-deal outcome.ldquoOnly these steps can give us a chance of escaping from the disasters of Brexit with some semblance of order, Mr Russell will declare.He will add: ldquoThen we must take the necessary steps to create a new constitutional settlement for these islands.

So as long as our first preference remains an option, that is what the SNP will back,\" she explained.The FM insisted the case for independence had been bolstered by events of the past three years but when quizzed about any formal announcement to call for another Scottish referendum remained uncommitted.She told the Marr Show: \"Scottish independence referendum is going to happen. Nothing in this le is absolutely inevitable, but its as inevitable as its possible to be.\"Before I set a path forward for Scotland, its reasonable for me to know what the starting point of that journey is going to be and the context in which we are going to be embarking on it.\"We need to know -and hopefully we will know this over the next few days and the next three weeks - is the UK leaving the EU  Is it leaving with a deal  Is it leaving with no-deal or is it not leaving at all  Perhaps looking at another referendum.Ms Sturgeon added: \"But the experience of the last almost three years now - Scotlands vote ignored, the voice of the Scottish Parliament ignored, all of the consequences that flow from Brexit completely outwith our control- that really does make the case for independence very, very powerfully.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-mays-premiership-teetering-on-the-brink-as-she-confronts-cabinet-plotters","story":"After unnamed senior ministers called for her to go, the two Cabinet colleagues mentioned as possible replacements, David Lidington and Michael Gove, came out publicly to deny any involvement in a prospective coup and professed their loyalty to the Prime Minister.Mr Gove declared: \"Its not the time to change the captain of the ship.

The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a meaningful vote this week.The continuing Tory turmoil followed a march for a Peoplersquos Vote in London on Saturday, which organisers estimated had involved around one million people, and as the online petition to scrap Brexit altogether topped five million signatures.This morning Mrs May is expected to have a showdown with her critics when she chairs what will be a fiery emergency Cabinet meeting in Downing St to seeshe can save her deal.Later, she will give a Commons statement on last weekrsquos European Council when the EU seized control of the Brexit timetable, giving Britain a delayed exit day of May MPs passed the PMrsquos plan this week or April they did not.Read more:Analysis: Mays deal is dead, time for Westminster to seize spirit of compromise - quicklyFollowing the statement, MPs will take part in another ldquonext steps debate and are expected to vote on an amendment tabled by Labourrsquos Hilary Benn and the Conservativesrsquo Oliver Letwin to enable so-called ldquoindicative votes on ious Brexit alternatives to take place on Wednesday such a move was defeated by just two votes last week but seems almost certain to get through this time round.The alternative options will include a Norway-style deal, a Canada-style trade deal, a Peoplersquos Vote, a no-deal and revocation.However, Mr Barclay cast doubt that the Government would accept any option that received a majority, stressing it ldquowould not be binding legally and that potentially it could cause a ldquoconstitutional collision with the Tory manesto.He explained such a scenario could risk sparking a general electionParliament instructed the Government to ldquodo something it was not elected to do.Last weekrsquos politically turbulent week appears for some to have shted the landscape dramatically and yet the PM faces a potentially even more fraught one this week given the backdrop now of MPs openly calling for her to resign. The financial markets could see sterling take a tumble.One Cabinet minister said: ldquoThe end is nigh. She wonrsquot be PM in  daysrsquo time while another noted how her judgement had ldquostarted to go haywire.In one remarkable development, a senior whip was said to have told Mrs May to her face that she should go because she was ldquobetraying Brexit and ldquodestroying our party.Nicky Morgan, the pro-EU former Education Secretary, urged ministers to tell the PM \"its time to go\" while leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said potential leadership contenders in the Government should \"act now\".George Freeman, Mrs Mays former policy adviser claimed it was \"all over for the PM\", tweeting: \"Shes done her best. But across country you can see anger. Everyone feels betrayed. Governments gridlocked. Trust in democracy collapsing. This cant go on. We need new PM who can reach out [and] build some sort of coalition for Plan B.\"Philip Hammond hit back. The Chancellor decried colleagues for their disloyalty, telling Sky Newsrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \"We have just over two weeks to complete this process before we get to April , the new deadline the Council has set last week. To be talking about changing the players on the board frankly is self-indulgent at this time.\"He went on: \"Changing prime minister wouldnt help us, changing the party in Government wouldnt help us: weve got to address the question of what type of Brexit is acceptable to Parliament, what type of way forward Parliament can agree on so that we can avoid what would be an economic catastrophe of a no-deal exit and also what would be a very big challenge to confidence in our political systemwe didnt exit at all.\"While he stressed he continued to support the PMrsquos deal, Mr Hammond also said that MPs had to look to compromise on the way forward and, interestingly, described a second EU poll as a ldquoperfectly coherent proposition.Mr Duncan Smith possibly gave Mrs May a reason to hope her deal might sneak through when the Scot, who has twice voted against it, said he was ldquokeeping my options open.The former party leader also decried those Cabinet ministers briefing against the PM, saying it was ldquoappalling and ldquodisgusting and suggested they should be sacked.Lord Howard, another ex-Tory leader, who has opposed Mrs Mayrsquos deal, said he had now reluctantly concluded that, on an assessment of risk, he was supporting it becauseit did not go through, then the country would be faced with a withdrawal ldquomuch further away from the kind of Brexit I wanthellipand possibly even no Brexit at all.One Scottish Tory MP stressed that the Chequers meeting was crucial as getting Mrs Mayrsquos deal through at the third attempt would only happen with the support of Brexiteers and Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists.ldquoShe may have to state very clearly what her timetable is for stepping down before they will even begin to consider voting for the agreement. She can still be PM and get the Withdrawal Agreement and Bill away but itrsquos pretty clear to me that she is going to have to step down from the leadership so that the Government can be reset for the next phase of the negotiations.He added: ldquoIrsquod like her to be allowed the respect of leaving office with dignity she deserves that."},{"url":null,"title":"art events at heritage centre","story":"The Garioch Heritage Centre will host exhibitors during the North East Open Studios art festival for the first time in September .The decision comes following the hugely successful Gordon Art Exhibition.The Centre will welcome the public to meet the exhibitors and view their works between Tuesday  and Sunday  September.Exhibitors have to complete their applications to NEOS by the end of March.The Centre will also host thw Exclusively Highlands Art, Craft and Food Fair on Saturday  and Sunday  June.A limited number of stalls are still available and can be booked by contacting Exclusively Highlands at info@exclusivelyhighlands.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Picturedare vice-chair of the IJB, Cllr Anne Stirling, chair of IJB,Rhona Atkinson and chief officer of the Aberdeenshire Health  Social Care Partnership, Adam Coldwells.

In the s, his predecessors in the conservative government then regarded our fishermen as expendable. It is beginning to look like this government has taken the same attitude towards our farmers.”Responding on behalf of the government parliamentary under-secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, replied: “I disagree entirely. The tarf schedule is designed to protect every sector of the economy including agriculture. He then went on to talk about standards, and we are not dropping standards of what we expect in agricultural goods.”Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The minister can disagree with me all he wants, but he can’t dismiss the views of our farmers and crofters. They know what they are talking about and have genuine concerns about whether food standards will be eroded as a result of cheaper imports. The government must start listening to the experts in this area, and the unions who work on their behalf otherwise we risk undermining an important part of our rural economy.“With only nine days left before we could find ourselves falling into a no deal scenario, the government have got to fix these tarf schedules before they do irreparable damage to our agriculture industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, Prospect has indicated that this would not be its members’ preferred option and it does not believe it would address their underlying pay issues.“As it stands the claim from the trade union remains a minimum of a double-digit increase effective from April , . A report compiled jointly between HIAL and Prospect on air traffic controller pay at non-HIAL airports found no evidence of a signicant pay dferential with other comparable airports.“At this point, it has not been possible to reach an agreement with the trade union on their pay dispute. Therefore, HIAL and Prospect have agreed to refer the matter to ACAS in a bid to resolve the matter.”However, David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer replied: #Members demands are reasonable and they need to be addressed. They are not seeking parity with Heathrow or Gatwick but other smaller airports.#“They have received a decade of below inflation pay rises while the rest of the industry, in response to a global shortage of controllers, has moved ahead. The company already struggles to recruit controllers and this is having an impact on services at some airports.“By asking for support from ACAS we hope to find a way forward in these talks. However ministers’ instructions to HIAL severely limit the companies negotiating position, so we also need to see these revoked.”As it stands, controllers at seven of HIAL’s eleven sites, including Kirkwall Airport, are due to take strike action on Friday, April .Industrial action short of a strike was also likely to start in April and continue through until August, and include instruction to work to rosters, refusal of non-medical extensions, an overtime ban, and withdrawal of goodwill.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Representatives from the commission are due to come to Orkney next month to discuss the proposals.Speaking yesterday, Ronnie Hinds, chairman of the commission, said: “We are pleased to begin our consultation on electoral arrangements with the three councils today and I look forward to engaging with them on our proposals.#It is important that electoral arrangements for Scottish councils are effective and that our proposals deliver on requirements for electoral parity and, as far as possible, take account of local ties and special geographical considerations.“We also welcome the flexibility offered by the IslandsAct to use one or two member wards and have used this flexibility as appropriate in our proposals. After completion of our consultation with councils we will be seeking public views on our proposals over the summer.”The  Review of Electoral Arrangements will make proposals for the six council areas specied in the IslandsAct  – Argyll and Bute, Highland, North Ayrshire, Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.The commission is conducting the review in two phases, focusing firstly on Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, with the reviews of  Argyll and Bute, Highland and North Ayrshire to take place after the public consultation in the islands groups takes place.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those behind the charity said it is well-known that men find it harder to admit to problems and seek help at an early stage, but the camaraderie of the Men’s Shed is helping to overcome this resistance.Despite the success of Orkney Men’s Shed and the growing popularity of the movement across Scotland, Mr McArthur suggested that they remain a “largely unsung success story”.  The MSP described the work the organisation does as “le-changing” for its members, providing a sense of purpose and an opportunity to make friends and share company.Speaking after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “The Men’s Shed movement has been a tremendous success over recent years with the number of Sheds and ‘Shedders’ across the country continuing to grow. This is illustrated perfectly in Orkney, where the local Men’s Shed is going from strength to strength, with membership up to  and plans for expansion of the shed in Finstown.“Every Men’s Sheds is dferent, of course, but all provide a place to work and relax, pursue hobbies, share skills, have a cuppa and a chat and get practical help with projects. This should not disguise, however, the real impact Men’s Sheds can and do have. Increasingly it is recognised that these facilities make a tangible dference in efforts to tackle loneliness, social isolation and mental ill health.“Last month, I urged the government to look at the case for allowing Men’s Sheds to bid in for health and wider social care funding. This is the approach in Australia, where the movement started, and there are strong arguments for assessingthe same might be done in this country. This could help sustain and expand Men’s Sheds, providing more people in Scotland with the chance to access the many benefits they deliver”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A total of , out of , participants in the study had developed dementia by . A north south ide in Scotland in the quality of drinking water was also revealed, with the North East coming out worst and the Borders and South West coming out on top. Coagulants such as alumare used to trap impurities in raw water by binding them together to form particles before they are filtered out. Fluoride occurs naturally and is not added to the water supply in Scotland. Researchers say there is some evidence that it increases the human absorption of aluminium. Study author, Dr Tom Russ from the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh, stressed that the low levels of aluminium and fluoride found in the water in Scotland were “very good” in relation to World Health Organisation guidelines. “Everybody included in the study was alive in  and they were all born in ,” he said. “Everybody who subsequently died with dementia was compared with those who died without, and the people who lived in areas of higher levels of aluminium in drinking water were more likely to die than those in areas where the aluminium levels were lower. “We still see this well accepted finding that higher levels of aluminium in particular are associated with an increased risk of dementia. It’s confirmatory rather than anything .”The study published in the British Journal Of Psychiatry, obtained water quality data from the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland for the years -. The DWQR is responsible for regulating public water supplied by Scottish Water, which was established in . Prior to this water quality was the responsibility of separate local authorities. A Scottish Water spokesperson said: “Scottish Water, like other UK water companies, operates in a highly regulated industry where public health is the prime concern and delivering high quality drinking water to customers across Scotland is a key priority for us.“We carried out over , tests in  at customer taps, our service reservoirs and treatment works to ensure customers receive consistently high quality drinking water and more than . per cent of tests at customer taps passed stringent quality standards.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"cargo lift for prestwick airport","story":"Glasgow Prestwick Airport has secured a new twice-weekly cargo service, expanding its freight operation.The deal will see CargoLogicAir operate Boeing  flights on a Monday and Friday connecting with Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Frankfurt Airport.Each service offers  tonnes of freight capacity providing a boost to Scotland’s oil and gas, aerospace and manufacturing sectors.Prestwick chief executive Stewart Adams said: “We’re extremely pleased to welcome CargoLogicAir as the airport’s latest freight operator.“With two weekly services carrying up to  tonnes, this is a tremendous addition to our extensive freight handling offering – a key part of the airport’s overall commercial strategy.“CargoLogicAir has ambitious expansion plans and utilising the services of Prestwick’s heavy-lt infrastructure, we’re excited to develop this partnership in support of its global operation.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit only two weeks to avoid an accidental no deal paris gourtsoyannis","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The UK#s Brexit fate is now in the hands of Remain-supporting Cabinet ministers and the other European Union member statesit is to avoid no deal, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.You wouldn’t normally base your political expectations on a chat in the pub. But when the guy propping up the bar is Theresa May’s top Europe advisor, Olly Robbins – the architect of her strategy in Brussels and the ERG’s favourite hate figure – you should safely be able to draw your Brexit roadmap from it.When ITV reported a second-hand overheard conversation in a Brussels bar where Robbins described how MPs would end up being presented with the option of May’s Brexit deal or a long delay, it seemed to offer a key that would unlock the whole process of leaving the EU.After MPs voted against no-deal last week and for an extension to Article , events appeared to be following Robbins’ script perfectly. The Government had hoped to bring the deal back for a third vote this week, with the threat of ­staying in the EU for anywhere between nine and  months looming over Brexiteers, forcing them to fall into line. Personally, I admit to breathing a sigh of relief at the end of last week’s chaos, thinking that a plan was coming together.But nothing has been more corrosive over the past three years than the illusion of government ­control, and some forces are beyond even Robbins’ reckoning. The fact that his plan was so dramatically derailed this week means that a no-deal Brexit – always the legal default – could now happen by ­accident, unless there is an even ­bigger twist in the week ahead.Rather than taking back control, the events of the past week put May’s fate in the hands of either the EU, or pro-EU Tories who could oust her to defeat her Brexit vision.: No-deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordNo one in Government predicted John Bercow’s intervention ­ruling out a third vote on the Brexit deal unless there was a signicant change in content or circumstances. That in itself is worrying – the convention that motions can’t be voted on twice in the parliamentary session isn’t an obscure one. No one needs more evidence that Downing Street is floundering, but there it is.His critics say Bercow’s intervention was an attempt to block Brexit and allow the second EU referendum he really wants, or at least rule out a no-deal scenario. By ruling out a vote before yesterday’s EU Council summit, the ­Commons Speaker certainly denied the ­Government its best chance of ­getting the deal through.Bercow’s statement forced the EU Commission’s chief Brexit ­negotiator Michel Barnier to come out the following day and say a long extension needed a “clear purpose”. It also gave time for ­Brexiteers in the Cabinet to ambush May and force her to take a request for a long extension off the table.The spectre aimed at scaring Brexiteers was vanquished, ­leaving opposition MPs as the only pool of votes to pass the deal. May’s extraordinary statement in Downing Street, shting the blame onto parliament, burnt that bridge, too.With ious extension plans being discussed during intense talks in Brussels last night, EU leaders appear to have come to the conclusion that May, and her deal, are finished.If she isn’t in control, to avoid a no-deal Brexit the UK is now in the hands of two groups: Remainers in the Cabinet, and the  governments of the EU.A group of pro-EU Cabinet ­ministers have insisted they would do whatever it takes to stop no-deal. They may now have the time to show they mean it.Both Barnier and French president Emmanuel Macron have said there is a way back,the UK is ready for “deep political change”.This could be a general election or a second EU referendum, but what the EU really wants to hear is that the red lines that have made a deal so dficultare going to be jettisoned, either by May, or her successor.The Remain group in Cabinet includes Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who joined Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke in breaking a three-line whip to abstain on a motion to extend Article  last week. With so little time left, resignation isn’t enough. They would have to become the ‘men and women in grey suits’, insisting the Prime Minister abandons her red lines, or ushering her out of ­Downing Street.The likes of David Lidington would need to lead a government of national unity in all but name, getting a Brexit deal through with Labour and SNP votes that keeps the UK in the single market and customs union. It would likely mean the end of the Conservative Party as we know it at the very least, it would leave it to the next Tory leader to put its surviving pieces back together.: Jeremy Corbyn won’t rule out stopping Brexit as PM arrives in BrusselsEven in Brexit Britain, a week can’t possibly hold that much drama, but a longer extension offers the opportunity.Still, EU leaders can’t give the UK something it isn’t prepared to ask for itself. Conservative MPs lost the chance to push May from office when they failed to do the job before Christmas. The UK’s venerable ­parliamentary democracy has shown itself not to be nimble enough for the last-minute pivot needed, and evenit could, its leaders command too little confidence to bring the public along with them.In EU capitals, an election or a new EU referendum looks like a leap into more uncertainty, which the ­continent scarcely needs. Leaders and officials gathered in Brussels spoke openly about the “crisis” in the UK, and don’t want their fragile politics infected by the febrile mood around Westminster.A no deal Brexit could still happen by accident. The only thing that’s certain is that Bercow and the EU have called time on Robbins’ pub blueprint.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why scotland s roads aren t ready for electric scooters alastair dalton","story":"Electric scooters are common in parts of Europe and the US and the UK Government is considering whether to allow them on British roads. Alastair Dalton explains why that would be a mistake.They offer a potentially attractive new way of getting about – but also threaten chaos on Scotland’s car-centric road networks.Electric scooters are commonplace in some European countries and US states, and the UK Government is now considering whether to allow them here too.Ministers announced this week they will “consider options for appropriate testing regimes to ensure any such vehicles on the road are safe and fit for purpose”, which could be followed by localised trials.On the face of it, being able to hop on and effortlessly zip about our towns and cities has obvious appeal – especially to non-cyclists.It is hardly “active travel”, like walking and cycling, but could encourage some to switch from cars or taxis on short journeys.Anything electrically powered, which has no emissions on the street, also has to be a positive as part of efforts to cut urban air pollution.However, letting loose a new form of transport on roads still woefully unsuited for cycles could just make things worse for everyone.That’s not to say there’s not a case for them – but the radical redrawing of road space away from the car should be accelerated first.The brave would take their chances scooting among other traffic, though many are likely to be deterred from sharing roads with lorries, buses and taxis, let alone the cars who already pass cyclists intimidatingly close.: Electric scooters on British roads would create ‘dangerous cocktail’There’s also the small matter of scooters’ in wheels not being pothole friendly, causing discomfortnot danger, as shared transport group Comouk has highlighted.Most who scoot are likely to want to stick to the relative safety of pavements and cycle lanes –that is permitted. But here, a dferent risk is created, of scooters colliding with pedestrians.There are far too few cycle lanes they could use, on roads or pavements, and even fewer segregated lanes, albeit cities like Glasgow are adding more.In addition, there is already potential conflict between walkers and cyclists on shared paths, some of which would struggle to cope with more riders, let alone scooters too.Another concern is street clutter. Recent visitors to Berlin and Brussels tell me of large numbers of scooters strewn across pavements.Technology may now enable scooters to be left “dockless”, but this has caused a big problem in places like San Diego.It’s bad enough trying to negotiate pavements already littered with advertising A-boards, so this could cause another hazard.Karen Millhouse, a resident of the Calornian city, emailed me this week: “I think we have more than , dockless scooters in our fair city, and they just keep coming. It is a nightmare, especially for pedestrians and the disabled.”She said Disability Rights Calornia had even filed a class action against scooters blocking pavements.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialA better plan for Scotland – and the UK – would be to focus on electric bikes first. The main rental schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow are due to add them later this year, along with other parts of Scotland such as Stirling.Electric bikes are equally effortless to ride, but unlike scooters provide nearly as much exercise as traditional cycling, so have much more to commend them.They also encourage people to cycle further, and have a similar topspeed – mph – as has been proposed for scooters.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit nicola sturgeon says theresa may is effectively out of power","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The option of revoking Article  and keeping the UK in the EU is #not off the table#, Nicola Sturgeon has said as she claimed Theresa May was #effectively out of power#.The First Minister said the SNP would push for Brexit to be halted by revoking Article  to avoid a no-deal exit.With ‘indicative votes’ on Brexit alternatives set to be held in the House of Commons, Ms Sturgeon said a single market and customs union deal to leave the EU was “not our first preference”.“At the moment, I think the option of remaining is not off the table and its not beyond the bounds of possibility by any stretch of the imagination,” she said.: Nicola Sturgeon calls on MPs to seize control of Brexit from beleaguered Theresa May“So as long as our first preference remains an option, that’s what the SNP will back.”Ms Sturgeon added: “I would like to see article  revoked.

Organisers claim up to one million took part. The EU has agreed to extend the UK’s originally scheduled departure this Friday, but with May’s deal poised to be rejected again, the situation remains mired in uncertainty.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s absence from the People’s Vote march yesterday was widely criticised and underlined the lack of consensus on a way forward on the constitutional impasse.Sturgeon received widespread cheers as she addressed the campaigners in Parliament Square yesterday afternoon. “Parliament should take back control,” she said.“Scotland – the land where more than  per cent of people voted to remain in the European Union – our voice has been ignored.”Sturgeon added: “Today we make our voices heard. And what our voices are saying loudly and clearly is this: Put it back to the people.”Watson was the only senior Labour figure at the rally and pledged to back a People’s Vote, amid concerns that Corbyn remains unconvinced. “We are one million strong,” Watson said.“Prime Minister, you’ve lost control of this process, you’re plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control.”Khan said it was “time to withdraw Article ”.He added: “it’s time to give us, the British people, a final say on Brexit.”Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson joined protesters, along with senior Tories Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening, as well as Anna Soubry of the recently founded Independent Group at Westminster and Green MP Caroline Lucas.The House of Commons may get the opportunity to vote on a second referendum this week, despite a recent Commons vote which saw the proposalheavily defeated by  votes to , when Labour abstained.However, even with every Labour MP voting in favour, the bid for a new referendum would have failed, meaning Conservative opponents of a People’s Vote must be convinced to change their minds, or at least abstain, for it to have any hope of being approved by Parliament.Senior figures in the SNP and Labour said they have spoken to Tories who previously rejected a People’s Vote, but are now willing to allow it to pass the Commons.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said a number of Conservative MPs had privately told him they supported a second EU referendum, but would only vote in favour once Labour is committed and a People’s Vote is likely to win Commons approval.“It is the right thing to do to go back to the people, and I actually believe thatwe had that unity across the opposition benches, that would put pressure on a number of Conservatives,” Blackford said.“A number of Conservatives say they want that to happen as well, but they do that privately, but they won’t break publicly.”Opposition leaders met with Corbyn this week and emerged disappointed, saying he insisted that a public vote could only be calledLabour’s proposed Brexit deal was on the ballot.A senior Labour MP told Scotland on Sunday that the internal battle over a second referendum was being won by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who back a People’s Vote, over Corbyn and his official spokesman, Seumas Milne – both of whom hold Eurosceptic views.“When it comes to a People’s Vote, it’s Starmer and McDonnell vs Milne and Corbyn. Bit by bit, we’re shting things slowly inside the party so that their views are irrelevant and their position becomes untenable,” said the frontbench MP.They added: “There are Conservative MPs I’ve spoken to who will abstain when it comes to another vote. We can get it through.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"traitor to england ian blackford harassed by brexit supporters in london","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP#s Westminster leader Ian Blackford was harassed by a group of Brexit supporters who shouted abuse at him as he walked down Whitehall.Mr Blackford and fellow SNP MP Stephen Gethins were leaving the Cabinet Office shortly after pm following a meeting to discuss Brexit with minister David Lidington.window.twttr : Brexit: EU leaders open door to long delay as May fails to set out plan B.\u2028A group of around a dozen people followed Mr Blackford, shouting “traitor to England” and “leave means leave”.Media interviews that were scheduled to take place outside the Cabinet Office had to be abandoned.

Koulibaly was sent off for sarcastically applauding the match official, his tormentors continuing to jeer him from the stands.When their punishment did arrive, however, it was swt and severe – Inter were ordered to play their next two home games in an empty stadium, the club and all its supporters held accountable for the behaviour of a vocal minority.It is this strict liability model which some believe could rid Scottish football of anti-social behaviour and its own peculiar scourge: sectarianism.But its introduction – or imposition – would probably be unpopular with clubs and some fans who feel increasingly under attack following the introduction of the Offensive Behaviour Act.Over the past  years, Scottish football’s periodic bouts of soul-searching over sectarianism and fan behaviour have become as predictable as the national team’s failure to qualy for major tournaments.After an ill-tempered Old Firm match in  – the latest in a long line of “shame games” – the Scottish Government took the matter out of the hands of the football authorities, introducing the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act.The legislation achieved the kind of consensus among fans, clubs and politicians that had hitherto proved elusive – nearly everyone hated it.Sir Tom Devine, one of the country’s most respected historians, described it as the “most illiberal and counterproductive act passed by our young parliament to date”.Despite being repealed last year, the legislation has nevertheless managed to leave a toxic legacy among some fans who feel they are being unfairly targeted by the police.Meanwhile, none of the game’s problems have gone away, with a small number of incidents over the past few weeks generating headlines for all the wrong reasons.Last month, Kilmarnock’s Catholic manager Steve Clarke said Rangers supporters had subjected him to abuse from the “dark ages” during a game at Ibrox, while striker Kris Boyd accused Celtic fans of calling him an “Orange bastard” and hitting him with a coin at Rugby Park.Other incidents include a glass bottle being thrown at Celtic player Scott Sinclair during a game against Hibs at Easter Road, a Hibs fan running on the pitch to confront Rangers captain James Tavernier and allegations that Hearts players were subjected to racial abuse during a game with Auchinleck Talbot.Amid all this, one of the country’s most senior police officers expressed concern at the level of sectarianism in the Scottish game, describing it as “almost visceral”.Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr, who began his career in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, said there had been a rise in sectarian abuse and offensive behaviour at football grounds during the past year, although he admitted it was hard to “quanty empirically”.It all means that strict liability, allowing clubs to be punished with fines, stadium closures and even points deductions for the behaviour of their fans, is back on the agenda. Professor Duncan Morrow, who led an advisory group on tackling sectarianism on behalf of the Scottish Government and published a report on the issue in , is an advocate of strict liability, but only as a “last resort”.“Self-regulation is by far the best outcome, but the glaring inconsistency between the way racism is handled and the way sectarianism is handled in Scottish football is now becoming too visible to be overlooked,” he says.“Legislation can be a blunt instrument, but eventually you have to come up with some sort of legislative framework. Strict liability and the way it is approached in other parts of Uefa [European football’s governing body] in relation to racism, has to be on the table.”Morrow’s original report described sectarianism as a “deep-rooted and serious problem” across the whole of Scottish society which was being perpetuated by a “culture of denial”. And in a  follow-up report he accused the football authorities of “frustrating” attempts to tackle the problem.The academic, who is based at Ulster University, says the “normalising” of sectarianism has resurfaced again in recent months, with the political climate around Brexit helping to encourage more extreme forms of hate speak.“The tolerance for hate speech has been made worse by the political climate we’re living in,” he says. “Brexit in that sense is very much the central issue.“The issue of sectarianism isn’t particular to football, but football needs to take a role. The strong preference is that football sets its own house in order. Strict liability is what you get to by default.”Yet Scotland is by no means the only country facing problems over football. In fact, following the game in Scotland is undoubtedly safer than in some other countries in Europe, where serious disturbances remain common.Fan violence has marred recent matches in Italy, Poland and the Netherlands, while Aston Villa player Jack Grealish was attacked by a fan during his club’s derby match with Birmingham City earlier this month.Nevertheless, a  survey by FIFPro, a players’ union, put Scotland second only to Congo as the league with the highest proportion of playerswho had received a threat of violence from a fan on match day.Paul Goodwin, of the Scottish Football Supporters Association, says many law-abiding fans now want the clubs to act.And he says strict liability has been shown to work in tackling problems with racism and homophobia where.“In ious places, from South America to eastern Europe, sanctions have been applied and racism and homophobia no longer surface at football matches,” he says. “Is it still there in places like Russia, Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria  The answer is yes, but football is no longer used as a vehicle.”Goodwin says his organisation plans to survey its members soon on the introduction of strict liability.“We think it’s got to be explored in Scotland. Scotland’s international matches are being played under strict liability, our clubs’ European games are played under strict liability. How can we be happy to play a game under strict liability in Madrid but not in Motherwell  It makes no sense whatsoever.”The charity Nil By Mouth, which was set up following the sectarian murder of Celtic fan Mark Scott in , agrees.“Scottish football has been trying to bury strict liability ever since it was first mooted back in ,” says director Dave Scott. “It scares clubs because they presently enjoy the invisible touch of self-regulation.“No-one is saying that strict liability is going to be a magic bullet, but the choice for Scottish football is stark: be part of the solution or continue to be part of the problem.”For some supporters, however, it is the police that are the problem.There is resentment over the apparently increasing use of filming during matches.And when officers in South Ayrshire last month tweeted about confiscating a few cans of beer and half a dozen bottles of Buckfast from a supporters’ bus, they were mocked by fans from across the country.At an Old Firm game at Celtic Park last season, five people were injured during a crush on the way into the stadium.Eyewitnesses described a sense of panic as thoughts inevitably turned to British football’s darkest day, the  Hillsborough disaster. After the incident, there was criticism of the way Police Scotland responded.When the two Glasgow sides meet again next weekend, Rangers supporters will be required to assemble at the velodrome near Celtic Park by .am before receiving a police escort to the ground.Following the crush, Police Scotland announced an independent review of football policing, although the final report, published earlier this month, made no mention of the incident.Its publication soured relationships between the police and one supporters’ group yet further after the Scottish Police Federation, a staff association, accused Fans Against Criminalisationof being “apologists for criminality” for refusing to engage with the review.In a statement released on the day of the report’s publication, the SPF said: “We concur with [report author] Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts that Scottish football has a hooliganism problem as well as a sectarian problem. “They are both manestations of the same peculiarity – that some supporter groups believe that criminal behaviour is acceptable at football matches.”FAC’s Jeanette Findlay says the relationship between fans and the police has “absolutely broken down”.“There’s a huge class bias here,” she says. “I hear of songs being sung at rugby which I think are disgusting. There are foul, sexually explicit songs sung at rugby and nobody cares about that.”On strict liability, she says: “We think it’s ludicrous to suggest that large groups of law-abiding citizens should be held responsible for the actions of a tiny number who break the law and we don’t think that applies anywhere  in society.“We’re back in the land of ‘something needs to be done’ – we never accepted that in relation to the [Offensive Behaviour] Act, and we don’t accept it now. “In the last few weeks there’s been a whipped-up moral panic that something terrible is happening, but look at how many incidents there have been. I don’t even think there’s been five.”Sectarianism is not a word Findlay uses. She argues Scottish football is merely reflecting society at large.“Wider society bleeds into football,” she says. “Is Scotland an anti-Catholic country  Yes, it is. It has very thinly veiled anti-Catholic and anti-Irish sentiments right through every class and every region and that bleeds into football.”While strict liability has its proponents in Scotland, there remain signicant question marks over its effectiveness.Inter Milan may have been punished for its supporters’ treatment of Koulibaly, but the Italian side has faced similar penalties in the past.Rangers played in an empty San Siro stadium as far back as  after Uefa closed the ground to fans for all of Inter’s group matches in the Champions League following crowd disturbances the previous season.In Spain, where referees have the power to halt games amid racial abuse from the stands, incidents remain depressingly common. During recent matches between Manchester United and Liverpool, fans have been heard singing songs which reference the  Munich air disaster and Hillsborough, while fans of Tottenham, a club with a large Jewish following, have been subjected to anti-Semitic chants from rival supporters.Broadcaster Jim Spence, who covers football for BBC Scotland, is among those who accept there is a problem in the Scottish game, but he remains to be convinced about whether strict liability is the answer.He believes the solution can only be found by the football authorities – the Scottish Professional Football Leagueand the Scottish Football Association– coming together with the Scottish Government to address the issue.“My fear with strict liability is that it takes a sledgehammer to crack a nut,” he says. “There’s no guarantee it will affect what we are seeing, which is basically criminal behaviour.“Strict liability is a nice little earner for Uefa because of the fines it hands out, but it hasn’t actually stopped racist abuse.“These are really complex issues. We’ve had the sectarian stuff in Scotland for a century. What we need is a meeting of minds. The SPFL, SFA and Scottish Government should sit down and nothing should be off the table.”The police are also clear that it will take much more than one measure to rid Scottish football of sectarianism.“The issue of sectarianism is not one you can easily arrest or legislate your way out of,” says DCC Kerr. “Sadly I had a lot of experience of this in Northern Ireland. It’s not on the same scale in Scotland, thank goodness, but it seems to be pervasive in certain elements of Scottish football. “I wouldn’t disagree that there’s a lot clubs can do to address this issue through deterrent tactics, more punitive tactics.“Of course there’s a responsibility on the clubs to do that. But just because the behaviour manests itself in football stadia doesn’t mean it’s only the responsibility of clubs. We all have a responsibility in this.”Asked for its position on strict liability, the SPFL said it would “continue to engage with key stakeholders to help tackle all criminality occurring at SPFL stadia”. The SFA did not respond to a request for comment. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it.

From pizza to pasta, Italian food is right up there with so many people’s tastebuds.As a lover of all things Italian, I was hugely excited when the Balmoral Hotel recently started their ‘Italian Night’, available every Tuesday night from -pm. I am no stranger to the thriving Black’s Road establishment and given the quality of food available in the Lady Anne Bistro and the conjoining Stix # Stones, the special-themed night attracted me to pay a visit once again to the Balmoral last Tuesday night.As ever, we were greeted by a polite and accommodating member of staff on arrival and shown to our table. I was immediately drawn by the décor – a number of Italian flags scattered around the restaurant and a huge blazing fire which was the perfect welcoming as Storm Gareth continued to rage outside.The themed-menu consists of a range of dishes sought to bring out the authentic taste of Italy and I couldn’t wait to peruse my choices. From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment. Warm and friendly staff, quality food and best of all, it’s right on your doorstep. I could not recommend the Italian night anymore. Go and check it out for yourself and tell me you don’t feel like you have been to Italy for the night. I cannot wait to plan my next Tuesday nightvisit.Balmoral Hotel,Blacks Road, Dunmurry, Belfast BT NFTel:    balmoralhotelbelfast.co.u"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"butsy was larger than life and loved by many","story":"BORN on September   the late Pat ‘Butsy’ Butler has been described as a “larger than le figure” and“someone who was known and loved by many”.Pat, who passed away on December  , was educated at St Teresa’s Primary School on the Glen Road, before moving to St Malachy’s College where he completed his secondary education. The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit is not possible to fully consider the merits of the case at this time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down in pole position

The previous year Downpatrick were the winners, making it a great run of success for clubs in the competition.This yearrsquos victory by Drumaness could have created a record, for they went through the entire competition without conceding a goal.In the final they took an early lead when Cyril Lennon thumped a great right-footed shot past the keeper and the winner from Stevie McCormick came near the end..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Julius Caesar swimming way back to full health  ","story":"A LUCKY loggerhead turtle is on the mend after receiving round the clock care by staff at the Exploris Aquarium in Portaferry.Named Julius Caesar because he looked like a fighter, the little turtle appears to be thriving and seems to be enjoying the attention that comes with being a local celebrity.Staff at Exploris say the once sickly turtle, who was discovered on a beach in Donegal in January usually prefers warmer waters of the mid-Atlantic and was a surprise discovery on the Irish coastline.They believe he may have been caught in the Gulf Stream and carried hundreds of miles off course before being saved in the nick of time as he was about to become dinner for some hungry seagulls.JC was treated for lsquocold-stunningrsquo and hypothermia when he first arrived at the aquarium. Since then Exploris curator Peter Williams has kept a watchful eye over the  month-old old turtle.Mr Williams said: ldquoThe loggerhead turtle arrived at Exploris Aquarium in a critical condition from a beach near Rosbeg, Co Donegal.ldquoSince then we have been working tirelessly to slowly raise the turtlersquos temperature by a couple of degrees every day. Our veterinary team also decided to administer a course of antibiotics as an increase in temperature heightened the risk of a secondary infection setting in.He added: ldquoI am now happy to report that JC is making slow but great progress and is feeding well on a iety of fish and invertebrates. He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months. They plan to release him back to his natural environment when he has fully recovered.Loggerhead turtles like JC can live to about  years of age in the wild and usually reach about three feet in shell .Mr Williams says the ultimate goal is to release the reptile back into the wild in warmer waters.This is not the first time Exploris has tried to nurse a lost loggerhead turtle back to health.In January , another loggerhead was found washed up on a Co Donegal beach and was also taken to Exploris suffering from hypothermia.Staff named that male turtle Columba, but sadly it died a short time later, making JCrsquos recovery all the more remarkable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McKinstry is on the mark at Jimmy’s 10  ","story":"THE Beast from the East was well and truly caged this year as the day dawned bright and sunny, although with a noticeable frosty nip to awaken unsuspecting toes and fingers of the small army of East Down clubmen and their cons which descended on the sleeping streets of the county town on Jimmyrsquos Ten Sunday.Their mission was to display the necessary Kilometre markers and warning signs around the soon to be crowded route.Time was of the essence as upwards of , runners and walkers had signed up for the biggest participation sporting event in the district and with the start brought forward to am, to facilitate the festival paradersquos new start time of pm, it was going to be a tight run affair to have all in place before the runners took over.But, as ever, the super team managed it with a bit to spare.It should be pointed out that at am the pathway at the Quoile was water free. Indeed, it was necessary to consider bringing a brush to clear some of the detritus left on the now, superbly-surfaced path, by Fridayrsquos flooding.It could well be that the water, which appeared before the runners got there, was another example of Patrickrsquos Holy Wells springing up to provide soothing cool water baths for warm and aching feet mdash well why not After all, it was St Patrickrsquos Day and it occurred near the spot where the great man first landed in this country.

Next year  Copying Mark McKinstyrsquos front running tactics, in a field of great talent and depth, Kerry OrsquoFlaherty took a leaf out his book from the outset and was cruising comfortably long before half way and took the victory in ..Laura Graham, still on the rise after injury and lay-off, found the last half a challenge, but still laid down a commendabletime of ..

Charlesrsquos mum was in the house when part of it collapsed and had to be taken to hospital.Sr Mary explained the scale of the damage was such that the remainder of the womanrsquos home had to be bulldozed, explaining the plan is to build a replacement on the same site.ldquoI know the lady very well and visited her when I previously worked over there, she continued. ldquoI am in regular contact with her son, who was my administrative assistant.ldquoI hope we will be able to raise the money needed to build the new home so she has her own roof over her head.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard. The proposed hotel development also includes plans to upgrade the Inch Abbey Road junction with the Belfast Road.Lidl submitted plans to secure outline planning permission to redevelop the . acre Shanslieve Drive site in January last year. It plans to bulldoze the existing school to pave the way for the construction of a new , square metre supermarket food store and dedicated centre for the volunteers who run the mountain rescue team.A new entrance via Bryansford Road is proposed, but there will be no access from Shanslieve Drive. The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, had lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners have insisted that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and that there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which could accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.The supermarket giant says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Prenter goals just the ticket  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School produced a sizzling display to get the better of a resolute Cathair Dhoire side in a nailbiting showdown at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Monday.The Red High had to show great fortitude and tenacity in one of the most exciting and entertaining MacLarnon Cup finals in years as the Derry amalgamation threatened to ruin St Patrickrsquos day.The Downpatrick lads werenrsquot found wanting when the chips were down and two goals from man of the match Tim Prenter mdash one in each half mdash was the main dference between the sides.Prenter was a deserved recipient of the award as he continually stalked the Cathair Dhoire defence at every opportunity and had them chasing shadows every time he went near the ball.Loughinislandrsquos Brandon Boyd opened the scoring for the Red High after only  seconds. Club mate Peter McMullan fielded the resultant kick out and released Ronan Connor to make it - to - after less than a minutersquos play.However, Cathair Dhoire started pushing up on the Red High kick-outs and this proved an effective tactic with scores flowing from Cahir McMonagle, Fergal Mortimerand Ben McCarronto take a - to - lead after just five minutes of free-flowing football.It could have been even worse for St Patrickrsquos as Cathair Dhoire wasted two excellent goal chances with superb defending from Bryansfordrsquos Jack Harbinson denying McCarron with a timely block.The Red High started gaining possession in and around the middle of the park, but they definitely missed the ball winning ability of Saulrsquos Ruairi OrsquoHare in this sector, although he did start at full forward.OrsquoHare picked up an injury while playing for the Northern Ireland U- team in a Centenary Shield game against Wales on Thursday night, but his switch to leading his sidersquos attack worked a treat.With seven minutes of non-stop football gone Prenter, a senior county hurler, left three defenders trailing in his wake as he cut through the Cathair Dhoire cover before drilling the ball low and hard into the bottom corner of the net.Not a bad goal considering there was absolutely nothing on when the Downpatrick player received the ball out on the left flank.The Red High now had a grip on the game and OrsquoHare plundered the next five points for his side, two from frees, but Cathair Dhoire kept in touch with two points from McCarron, leaving the Downpatrick school with a - to - lead after  minutes.The Derry amalgamation sensed blood and towering midfielder Oran McGrath plucked the ball out of the air and ended a bustling run with an improvised finish to the net.Cathair Dhoire were far from finished and unanswered points from McCarron, McMonagle and Mortimer had the sides level after  minutes with all to play for.It could have been curtains for the Red High at this stage, but lsquokeeper Eoin Maginn saved his sidersquos bacon with two wonderful saves.Ruairi Quinn edged the Red High back in front just minutes after being introduced and the impressive OrsquoHare made it a - to - game  minutes.Prenter then finished Cathair Dhoire off with a second sensational goal. McMullan converted a late free after OrsquoHare had been sent off and McCarron grabbed the last score of the game for a battling Derry side.St Patrickrsquos: E Maginn, J Harbinson, E Rooney, L Guiness, P McMullan, R Murphy, B Boyd , C Watson, R OrsquoHare , T Smyth , O Cunningham, N Laverty, T Prenter , R Connor , T Savage.

In the Republic, the Irish government may soon have to decide whether to intervene in the case of Lisa Smith, the Dundalk woman who travelled to Syria a number of years ago to join IS.She now has a two-year-old son and the pair are staying in the Al Hawl camp for the family members of Isis fighters.It is sadly too late for Ms Begumrsquos son. But there are countless other children in similar circumstances andnothing , this story should serve as a timely reminder that children are not to blame for their parentsrsquo actions.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However he like myself want a peaceful island with equality for everyone, something that Sinn Fein have shown exists only to those in their own bubble.In reality Sinn Fein could be the biggest obstacle to republicans of all shades to achieve unity and a united Ireland. For me personally no effort has been made to show unionists they would be welcome and equal in a united Ireland rather the rhetoric from Sinn Fein and certain ‘journalists’ is, “A united Ireland is a must whether you unionists or others like it or not”. Clearly some politicians and political parties have learned nothing from the near , deaths in our ‘Troubles’. Not one death justies political aspirations or sectarian bigotry. We all deserve a lot better from these politicians who promote ision and see a united Ireland as the end of our problems and ision regardless of unionists not being convinced of a new Ireland due to the politics of those self serving “leaders” and politicians who have shown no respect to others.I want peace, stability, and a country where my grandchildren are safe and are treated as equals irrespective of religion, colour, gender or political beliefs. Unfortunately watching and listening to Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill I don’t believe that will happen. Maybe the two of them should sit down with Arlene Foster and the three of them can put their hands up and finally admit that the three of them has got it wrong in their own versions of equality and have the courage to admit how arrogant each one is in dealing with the past and delivering a real future for all citizens of this great island.Raymond McCord, Victims campaigner, North BelfastJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/9610254.jpg","title":"news","story":"Leisure Centre making a splash for Red Nose DayAccidentVale charity worker helps refugees in LebanonAccident\"\"\"Vegan Fair held to celebrate Mothers DayAccident\"\"\"Councillor sacked from Vale cabinet roleAccident\"\"\"Couple take on marathon for charity - despite no experienceAccident\"\"\"Two left with minor injuries after four car collision near Dinas PowysAccident\"\"\"School of the Month - A small school with a big impactAccident\"\"\"Students seize control over primary schoolAccident\"\"\"From the Archive: Man makes bid for world recordAccident\"\"\"View from Westminster: Stephen Doughty MPAccident\"\"\"New wellbeing centre - have your sayAccident\"\"\"Penarth, the sea, le and me: Alison PowellAccident\"\"\"Cycle comments scheme amid roundabout rowAccident\"\"\"Parking charges could be on the way to Vale areasAccident\"\"\"Vale mum to star in TV cancer awareness campaignAccident\"\"\"Vale councils help for homeless rewardedAccident\"\"\"Hotel chain plans next site in PenarthAccident\"\"\"Surgeon shares stories of le working in war zonesAccident\"\"\"Divisions cited as Vale council administration suffers budget disputeAccident\"\"\"Plans for new bypass ‘closest in  years’Accident\"\"\"Vale of Glamorgan Council#s new budget agreedAccident\"\"\"Ty Hafn children#s hospice to support community nursesAccident\"\"\"Main road blocked by tree brought down due to strong windsAccident\"\"\"New Divisional Commander appointed for ValeAccident\"\"\"View from the SeneddAccident\"\"\"Library moves to new site during renovationsAccident\"\"\"Man found dead on beach ruled to have drownedAccident\"\"\"View from Westminster: Stephen Doughty MPAccident\"\"\"Nextbikes scheme could be extended to the ValeAccident\"\"\"Twenty is plenty Vale chiefs tell Welsh GovernmentAccident\"\"\"An Inspector calls: Andy RiceAccident\"\"\"Laughter and partying galore as town enjoys Winter CarnivalAccident\"\"\"New trees to be planted at country parkAccident\"\"\"Explorers ready to take on Iceland expedition for charityAccident\"\"\"Special statement made on Vale council budgetAccident\"\"\"Vale of Glamorgan has lowest rate of diabetes across WalesAccident\"\"\"Cancelled bus routes alarm residentsAccident\"\"\"Fundraiser for care home totals up to £,Accident\"\"\"Volunteers start microplastics survey on beachAccident\"\"\"View from The Senedd: Andrew RT Davies AMAccident\"\"\"View from Westminster: Stephen Doughty MPAccident\"\"\"Delight as company scoops major Welsh awardAccident\"\"\"Penarth, the sea, le and me: Alison PowellAccident\"\"\"Cardf  Vale health board launches eating disorder videosAccident of King Street Penarth.

But the consultants draft stage  report clearly states what weve all known for many years ndash which is that a by-pass must be part of any solution.\"There have been those who claim the Welsh Government dont have the funds for a bypass road.

The Caernarfon by-pass cost could spiral from the original pound. million to pound. million.\"Work towards a positive outcome is further forward than at any time since it was first mooted over  years ago.\"There are a number of other steps still to be taken before the cabinet will eventually decide which by-pass route option and other measures should be surveyed and designed in detail in stage .The council has promised a public consultation of the proposals in the future, giving everyone the opportunity to discuss and comment on the project with officials and consultants. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I recognise that there are a number of local and national groups advocating the introduction of such limits on a signicant scale across the Vale of Glamorgan, a number of whom I have personally met, however I am also aware that there are many residents in the Vale who are opposed to the concept.ldquoChanging the minimum speeds in many areas of the Vale from mph to mph as is being suggested by some groups, represents a major decision for this council and one which I feel requires input and guidance from our government due to the lack of evidence available of their success to date, the juxtaposition of our residents, the cost of their introduction, which is estimated at poundk for this council, and the fact that this is a Wales, or even, a UK wide issue.Cardf is the only council to introduce the reduced speed limit in most of its residential streets, compared with more than  in England.Anthony Slaughter, one of the founders of the lsquorsquos Plenty for Penarthrsquo campaign said: ldquoIt is disappointing to see the Vale council avoiding a decision on this vital issue. A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

I recognise that there are a number of local and national groups advocating the introduction of such limits on a signicant scale across the Vale of Glamorgan, a number of whom I have personally met, however I am also aware that there are many residents in the Vale who are opposed to the concept.ldquoChanging the minimum speeds in many areas of the Vale from mph to mph as is being suggested by some groups, represents a major decision for this council and one which I feel requires input and guidance from our government due to the lack of evidence available of their success to date, the juxtaposition of our residents, the cost of their introduction, which is estimated at poundk for this council, and the fact that this is a Wales, or even, a UK wide issue.Cardf is the only council to introduce the reduced speed limit in most of its residential streets, compared with more than  in England.Anthony Slaughter, one of the founders of the lsquorsquos Plenty for Penarthrsquo campaign said: ldquoIt is disappointing to see the Vale council avoiding a decision on this vital issue. A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

Improvements to public transport and cycling and walking routes are also being considered.The council says it needs to engage with Network Rail to understand the potential costs around building the bypass near a railway tunnel, model improvements to the Merrie Harrier junction, and undertake a public consultation.The council is asking the Welsh Government for pound, to complete theWelltag outline business case butthat funding isnrsquot given the authority would find the money.Emma Reed, the councilrsquos head of neighbourhood services and transport, said at a council meeting on March  that a -week consultation could be launched before the summer break in August.Mrs Reed told the Environment and Regeneration Scrutiny Committee: ldquoWe have made great progress on this project over the last couple of years.ldquoWe still need to do this additional work.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.

It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history.
