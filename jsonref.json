Once seen as the heir apparent to the late Yitzhak Rabin, Barak engaged in peace negotiations with the Palestinians during his time as prime minister. But his popularity plummeted after the second Palestinian uprising erupted and he was quickly voted out of office.Supporters view him as perhaps the only figure with the security credentials and gravitas to challenge the long-ruling Netanyahu. But critics see him as a failed prime minister.Barak joins a political field already crowded with former military brass. The Blue and White party, which drew even with Netanyahu\u0027s Likud in the April 9 election, is headed by former army chief of staff Benny Gantz and two other ex-generals.In his impassioned speech, Barak addressed Netanyahu \u0027as your former commander\u0027 and said he \u0027can\u0027t continue and hold on to the reins of power.\u0027         The 77-year-old Barak, who was once Netanyahu\u0027s (pictured) army commander, served as military chief and then prime minister from 1999-2001\u0027For your own good, and for the good of the state and everything you\u0027ve contributed to it during your life, your time as a political leader is over,\u0027 Barak said.After elections in April, Netanyahu attempted to form a governing coalition with religious and nationalist allies, but failed to cobble together a parliamentary majority amid infighting between allies.Rather than give his main rival a chance to build a government, Netanyahu\u0027s Likud party instead pushed through a measure to dissolve the Knesset, Israel\u0027s parliament, and send the country to unprecedented repeat elections in September.Netanyahu now seeks to score a decisive electoral victory in the face of possible indictment on corruption charges. Israel\u0027s attorney general has already recommended Netanyahu be indicted, but under Israeli law, Netanyahu is entitled to defend himself at a hearing before formal charges are filed.Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has scheduled the hearing in October, just weeks after the election. Netanyahu, who denies wrongdoing, is hoping that an election victory will give him enough parliamentary support to win immunity from prosecution."},{"url":null,"title":"BBC bosses admit Newsnight host Emily Maitlis not everyones taste","story":"Share this article In an updated message, the BBC defended Maitlis and said the presenter\u0027s role had been to \u0027seek clarification and direct answers\u0027. \u0027The programme itself wasn\u0027t styled on a typical debate programme, rather a hustings for the candidates and to give the audience a chance to get to know the candidates better,\u0027 a BBC spokesman said. \u0027However Emily ensured that all of the candidates were given the chance to answer the questions and put their views across.\u0027         Some viewers felt Maitlis (left) had \u0027failed to control\u0027 the hustings between five Tory candidates (from second left, Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart)\u0027We highly regard Emily as one of our regular presenters, she is extremely experienced and well versed with dealing with politicians. \u0027We consider that she did a good job during this programme.\u0027 The BBC has already faced one storm over the June 18 programme, after it emerged that an imam who questioned the Tory candidates had sent anti-Semitic tweets. Abdullah Patel asked the five men about Islamophobia, but had previously written about a \u0027Zionist payroll\u0027 and suggested Israel should be relocated to America. After the row erupted Mr Patel was suspended from all duties at the primary school where he is deputy head. Rob Burley, who edited the programme, said Mr Patel\u0027s Twitter account had been deactivated ahead of his appearance on the BBC debate – meaning his tweets could not be read.          A series of vile posts by Abdullah Patel were unearthed moments after the BBC debate he took part in endedBBC Radio 5 Live presenter Nicky Campbell said the imam had made \u0027extremely disturbing\u0027 comments and said he was \u0027sorry\u0027 that the BBC had not found them.  During the debate, Mr Patel had asked the five candidates whether they believed words had consequences. Boris Johnson said he was \u0027sorry for the offence\u0027 his comments about veiled Muslim women looking like \u0027letter boxes\u0027 and \u0027bank robbers\u0027 had caused. Mr Johnson also said he believed his Muslim great grandfather would have been \u0027very proud\u0027 to have seen him become foreign secretary. However at one point he appeared to forget Mr Patel\u0027s name, referring to him as \u0027my friend over there\u0027, before presenter Maitlis interjected: \u0027Abdullah\u0027. The row then deepened after it emerged that another of the questioners was a former Labour candidate. Aman Thakar flew the Labour flag in Borough and Bankside in the Southwark local election last year. "},{"url":null,"title":"Welton primary school bans kids choosing play with","story":"Share this article She said she spent a lot of time researching schools before her child joined last year, but was not made aware of the playground rules from Year 1 upwards and also did not know classes were mixed up each year.She said: \u0027I really don\u0027t know what is going on in the headteacher\u0027s head, saying socialisation is a barrier to to pupil outcomes.\u0027The sentence seems harsh and at odds with children\u0027s need for socialisation and their mental health and wellbeing.

A major focus is on universal credit, the welfare reform that merged six government benefits into one. While it has drawn intense scrutiny and criticism in Britain, surprisingly little attention has been given to what is likely to be its greatest and most enduring impact. What became apparent to us after interviewing leading scholars, digital experts, welfare rights organisations and inidual claimants is that universal credit is not only a massive welfare policy reform it also represents a transformational move towards digital government.The pioneering postwar British welfare state is rapidly being replaced by what we term a “digital welfare state”. This is presented by the government as an apolitical and technocratic fix aimed at making government more efficient and cost-effective. But in some respects it is also a politicised effort to undermine the social rights of the poorest members of British society, while making it ever more difficult to legally challenge adverse decisions.While no one would suggest that it has been a stealth exercise, this radical transformation has taken place without fanfare and with minimum scrutiny from parliament, the media and civil society. At least the government cannot be accused of being coy about its digital ambitions. It has clearly acknowledged that universal credit is a key part of a broader digital approach to government. Thus its 2017 Government Transformation Strategy promised the “total transformation of government” through digital technologies and boasted that it was “the most ambitious programme of change of any government anywhere in the world”. What a pity so few seem to have noticed!But digital by default universal credit is only the tip of the iceberg of Britain’s emerging digital welfare state. Much more serious changes are happening behind the walls of UK government bureaucracies. The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), for example, is busily automating the machinery of the welfare state, including by developing a “fully automated risk analysis and intelligence system for fraud and error”. What that is likely to mean, although hardly anyone outside the DWP seems to know exactly, is that a great many government databases (as well as private social media accounts, apparently) will be matched and analysed by new tech tools.It would be a mistake to think of these as isolated problems. Many other countries are grappling with such digital issues. Commentators have warned that the Danish welfare state might accidentally die by algorithm, and in the Netherlands civil society is litigating against a government data matching system to detect benefit fraud, targeted especially at poor neighbourhoods. While these systems of disempowerment, discriminatory targeting and arbitrary privacy intrusions are for the moment mostly affecting poorer families in the UK and elsewhere, in the end no one will be safe. Why should the government not scrutinise everyone’s social media accounts to try to detect signs of income tax fraud, and why not require everyone to communicate with their GP exclusively via a digital portal?This is by no means to suggest that everything digital is bad, or that fraud should not be exposed. There is actually enormous positive potential for the use of digital technologies in a modern welfare state. Digital interaction with the authorities may greatly lessen administrative burdens – for example, by reducing unnecessary travel to a welfare office or by automatically reminding beneficiaries that they forgot to attach a document to their application.But in the design of universal credit, explicit political choices have been translated into technological design, with devastating effects on inidual lives. And politicisation through technology has hardly been an issue of intense public debate in the UK, in large part because of the veil of secrecy surrounding digital innovation.Crucial new tech experiments, such as the automation of the calculation of benefits in universal credit, remain the bailiwick of civil servants, technologists and big consulting firms advising the government. This partial outsourcing has created serious transparency deficits that the current Freedom of Information Act cannot resolve. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism recently released a report that underlined systemic problems with uncovering even basic information about outsourcing in the area of digital government.In a functioning democracy, political choices about the future of the digital welfare state should ultimately be made by the electorate, not by an engineer, government bureaucrat or private consultancy. But in order to reach the stage of a proper public and democratic debate about the digital welfare state, there is a desperate need for more information about what is actually happening behind the walls of government ministries. It is time for Britons to demand the truth.• Philip Alston is UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.

No matter how long I spend poring over them, painstakingly writing out everything in a black fountain pen and BLOCK CAPITALS, I’m positive I’ve made a mistake. What if, when confronted with one of those “do you consent to this company contacting you” questions, I wrongly ticked the box that allows them to message me via swarms of angry bees? What if, instead of requesting an aisle seat, I’ve mistakenly given my consent to be fired out of the plane via ejector seat if they’ve overbooked the flight? It’s a fear I’ll never get over, especially not after this week, when I learned of the horrifying story of David Smith, a 60-year-old punter from Loughborough, who managed to lose £189,000 on an accumulator by filling out a form wrongly. Move over Best Friends’ Thug Baby – this scenario has replaced all of my nightmares now.Two weeks ago, Smith picked six outside winners on an accumulator that added up to £212,000, a truly baffling amount of money. When he went to collect his winnings, however (presumably with a wheelbarrow, to take it back to a Scrooge McDuck-style vault), he realised that instead of writing “Bialco”, a winner in the 2.15 at Perth, he had put down the annoyingly similarly named Bailarico, third placed in the 3.40 at Goodwood. Personally I’d argue this is proof that horse-owners need to come up with more original names (Philip Seymour Hoofman, Pony Cascarino, Chevalerie Singleton, Horson Welles, anyone?). According to Smith, he had alerted the staff at his local Betfred to his mistake after the 2.15 but before the 3.40 race, and they had assured him that his bet would count. When he checked his winnings, however, the sixth bet was void, meaning that he had lost nearly £200,000, earning him the paltry sum of just £23,000 – a figure that at least could buy him 3,878 of the world’s smallest violins.If you think about it, the story follows a classic “underdog takes on the big bad guy” narrative, where a hopeful punter literally beats the odds to pull off an incredible victory – but then, after overcoming the slings and arrows of misfortune, he’s defeated by something as stupid as an administrative error. It’s like if Rocky ended with Stallone beating Apollo Creed in a stunning victory, but just as he’s about to lift the championship belt he trips over his own shoelace and knocks himself out on the corner cam.But perhaps more interesting than the story itself is how people react to it – and specifically, who they think is in the wrong. On the one hand, you can empathise with the bookie (as much as it’s possible to empathise with a powerful corporation that profits from the addiction and suffering of others) – rules are rules, and Smith did technically place his bet on the wrong horse. On the other hand, it’s clear that’s not what Smith intended, and surely the system has to be flexible enough to incorporate human error. Smith also claims that none of this would have happened if the regular manager, whom he knows well, had been at the shop when Smith noticed the error, as he would have corrected the bet immediately. But then is that really how this system should work? Unbending, unforgiving rules, unless you happen to know people in high places?Both positions, when taken to extremes, are ludicrous – either strictly defined rules control every aspect of our lives and deviation from them means ruin (ie Nineteen Eighty-Four), or rules are meaningless, and one’s stock in life is defined solely by whom one knows (ie Mad Max, the feudal system, or the lives of the shortlisted candidates in the Conservative leadership campaign). The answer is probably a combination of the two, along with a reliance on how things are “usually” done. But we’re entering a scary new world, where those traditions are breaking down, and adherence to rules by our political elites – both legal and unspoken – seems to be optional. We must, it seems, pick sides.Underneath this story about a horse named after a Portuguese folk dance, there’s a binary choice to be made – do we favour the bookmaker, and embrace the tyranny of law, or do we favour Smith, and embrace the anarchy of none?• Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31c869259940032011d4674f7dcd11019410ae1/275_143_1436_861/master/1436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bc5af9826de43d7cc88a96fa024d06e","title":"women on the verge of a cricket shakedown","story":"Being a cricketer and a woman is no easy path. Tasneem-Summer Khan meets a coach, an umpire, and a player inspiring girls and the game to come togetherYou won’t often hear cricket described as trailblazing it’s more commonly thought of as reactionary. However, spurred on by a summer of World Cup and Ashes cricket, women and girls all over Britain are making their mark on the sport.Asma Ajaz-Ali, a third-generation British Pakistani who grew up in inner-city Birmingham, experienced a variety of socioeconomic and cultural barriers to playing the game. Despite this lack of access to the formal game, she taught her brothers to play on an informal basis, then began running sessions for women and girls who had never before held a bat, supported by Warwickshire CC.“People think cricket is all upper middle-class men,” says Ajaz-Ali, who joined the ECB’s ambitious South Asian Action Plan, supported by NatWest, that aims to transform community engagement by recruiting 2,000 female mentors. “I go to mosques, temples, community centres, and get children and women from everywhere involved. Children see their mothers coaching and feel pride. It tells them they can do that too. These initiatives change opportunities and cultural attitudes for generations.”Ajaz-Ali prefers to focus on the future than lamenting her own lack of opportunity growing up. “I can’t bring back that time for me, but I can offer something to these girls,” she says. She sees change happening in the sport and aspires to generate more: “I have women playing in shalwar kameez, I coach asylum seekers. The point is to break down barriers and build inclusivity. Cricket is such a cool sport. It’s vibrant, it’s dynamic, and we have to try harder to make more people, particularly girls of all backgrounds, understand that.”Much like Ajaz-Ali, Laura Caughey found it hard to get a game of cricket. Growing up in Northern Ireland, she attempted to join a team as a child, only to be told she could practise with the boys but, lacking female peers, could not play in matches. “That stuck with me through adulthood and it’s not something I want more girls to experience.”Caughey decided to focus on a different aspect of the sport – umpiring. “I’d watch Simon Taufel and study what he did … he was my cricket idol growing up.” She became Ireland’s second female umpire this year when she was appointed to the representative panel of match officials.Through umpiring, Caughey has met like-minded people and helped to shape the conversation through administrative panels, eventually helping to set up and develop a women’s side at her local Carrickfergus CC. Reflecting on the enduring dismissive attitudes towards women in the sport, she says: “I just want to enjoy my season and let my on-field speak for me.”Ellie Threlkeld has been playing cricket for 10 years. She credits her experiences in mixed-gender cricket for developing skills which saw her move from the age-group county setup to playing for Lancashire Thunder in the semi-professional Kia Super League.Recognising the limited prospects for women cricketers, she opted to study psychology at Loughborough. The university’s enviable facilities and MCCU membership enable her to simultaneously develop her game and prepare for another option if cricket doesn’t work out.Threlkeld – who has ambitions to replace her England wicketkeeping heroes Sarah Taylor and Amy Jones one day – volunteers, coaches, and does ambassador work to grow interest and participation. “Assemblies get a great turnout, and girls can see how good it is to be a cricketer, but kids don’t just need role models – they need more thrown into the game so it’s an actual career.“A lot of women don’t have the option to train full-time – they need to work to earn a living. If there was money involved in the game, everything would improve faster.”With women all over the country dedicating their time and energy to the sport, barriers are shifting – new generations of girls are becoming women under the tutelage of these inspirational characters, and it’s hard to imagine anything but a positive future for British women’s cricket.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

That’s because the film’s subject, the London-born artist Penny Slinger, slinked through all those realms, creating startling work in collage, film and theatre that was both quintessentially of its time and ahead of times to come, prefiguring themes that would crop up again in the shock imagery of YBAs in the 1990s and beyond.This fascinating career re-examination drifts serenely back and forth between archive footage, clips from the films Slinger co-created and performed in (The Other Side of the Underneath, Vibration) and long closeups on Slinger’s 2D work. Interview clips with Slinger herself weave in and out, as well as talking-head snippets from her former partners (in every sense) and collaborators such as Peter Whitehead and Susanka Fraey, as well as assorted explicators such as the writer Michael Bracewell, artists Jane and Louise Wilson, and Antony Penrose, son of the artist Lee Miller and ICA co-founder Roland Penrose, who was a significant patron of Slinger’s back in the day.What’s revealed is work informed by the surrealism of the 1920s and 30s, especially Max Ernst, about whom Slinger wrote her graduate thesis – that highly sexualised and erotic but still provocative and not easily classifiable artist. An art world “It Girl” of her day, the strikingly beautiful Slinger was her own model, subject and canvas, and appears throughout, frequently naked and unafraid. It’s not hard to see how she ended up getting into tantric stuff later in life and more doctrinaire types may feel uncomfortable about how her work cropped up, seemingly with her consent, in straightforwardly pornographic contexts such as Knave magazine, just as easily as it did in Spare Rib, the feminist bible back in the day. Her interest in magic, the occult, and Jungian psychology (there’s a lot of chatter about archetypes) really embeds Slinger in a sinister side of the 1960s, while the predominantly monochrome look of the work and scratchy cinematography, even in the original interviews, makes the whole documentary feel like something dredged up from the archives rather than a work completed two years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c364083bff1475043049648b16a8e737e31e8a60/634_36_2870_1722/master/2870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f721e03d57e4fdfbf56da68e96d9907d","title":"spider man far from home review jake gyllenhaal","story":"Tom Holland swings into Europe on a school trip that sees Prague under attack, Italy in danger – and Jake Gyllenhaal wearing a very weird helmetWell, not too far from home. In fact, we are on pretty familiar ground, despite Spider-Man now going on a hormonally charged school trip to Venice, Prague and other European cities whose national governments have given this film tax breaks.For all these exotic novelties, this is a very mainstream Marvel picture, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers and directed by Jon Watts, culminating in the traditional CGI damage to tourist landmarks in the time-honoured final battle-spectacular. A new character has been perfunctorily added in the form of Mysterio (Gyllenhaal) and the film is certainly nowhere near the envelope-pushingly surreal ambition of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, from last year.But Tom Holland is still very winning as Spidey, still living at home with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) who is embarrassing him with her love life and by referring to her nephew’s spider sense as “Peter tingle”. J Jonah Jameson makes a brief, horrible return as a gruesome Alex Jones-style pundit, and Peter Parker has all sorts of dramatic new problems (it’s important to stick around for those post-credit stings).We are now in the post-Endgame, post-“blip” world where those who were disappeared have now reappeared and Peter Parker is back in high-school, hanging out with his unthreatening wingman Ned (Jacob Batalon) and romantically obsessing over MJ (Zendaya) who is being pursued by a new suitor, Brad (Remy Hii). Peter is planning to tell MJ how he feels in one of the romantic European locations they are due to visit during the upcoming break.But Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) has other plans for him: a terrifying storm-like force called an “elemental” is reducing various cities to rubble and so far the only combatant ranged against it is newcomer Quentin Beck (Gyllenhaal) from another dimension, who wears a helmet like an opaque fishbowl and whom the Italian media fatefully dub: “l’uomo del mistero”. Beck struggles mightily against the shape-shifting typhoon in Venice, causing a teen onlooker to gasp: “He’s kicking that water’s ass!” Fury needs Parker to step up and help Beck, to embrace his destiny and to justify the trust placed in him by the late Tony Stark. Is Spider-Man – that fresh-faced kid from Queens – in fact Stark’s true heir ? Those are some big iron boots to fill.The pieties these teenagers offer to the great generation of Avengers are amusingly drawn, especially the painfully earnest “in memoriam” section of the school’s TV news broadcast at the beginning: we are mischievously allowed us to think that this is going to be the film’s own dead-straight tribute to Stan Lee, before we notice the cheesy production values. Jackson, as ever, puts the ballast of maturity into the movie, needed more than ever now that Robert Downey Jr is now not in the picture. Holland is very good but he needs someone to play against, someone with Downey’s heft. That someone could well be Zendaya, as MJ, the great love of Peter Parker’s life.

It’s another hero’s journey in which women are there to dote, scold and sell outThe premise of Yesterday should be intriguing: what would a world without the Beatles look like? Yet having set the question, director Danny Boyle and writer Richard Curtis don’t seem terribly interested in exploring its logic: if the Beatles had never existed, why are Oasis the only other band erased by this butterfly effect? Why do characters variously reference the Beach Boys and Coldplay, bands whose existence is contingent on that of the Beatles? Why does rabid fandom, ie the long-tail evolution of Beatlemania, remain intact?It’s not that Boyle and Curtis are incapable of holding fast to a central concept: after all, Yesterday has no trouble committing to a world in which music by women doesn’t exist, and in which women themselves are only there to enable male musicians to live out their dreams.When Jack (Himesh Patel) flings his records off his shelf in search of his Beatles LPs, which have vanished thanks to some strange calamity that has torn a Beatles-shaped hole in the cosmos, everything he pulls out is by male artists. As soon as Jack’s moon-eyed frienddevoted manager Ellie (Lily James) appears, it is thunderingly evident (to everyone but hapless Jack) that she is in love with him. He doesn’t love her and his original music is drivel. Yet this is a Richard Curtis film, and so her burden is to love and support him while waiting hopefully for him to notice her. Ellie’s trajectory is so predictable that you wonder if it’s a joke that’s going to pay off later on. It’s not, and it doesn’t. Yesterday is too mush-minded to attempt any narrative volte-face.Yesterday works harder to posit Ed Sheeran – in a typically self-effacing cameo – as the only musician capable of holding a candle to the Beatles than it does to making its few female characters feel like real people, let alone artists themselves. (There’s also Jack’s manager Debra, played by saving grace Kate McKinnon, who is, quelle surprise, an unreasonable nightmare.) It sits at odds with the Beatles’ real-life legacy with women – a conflicted one, certainly, but also one that foregrounded the agency and achievements of Yoko Ono and Linda McCartney. Still, it is entirely in keeping with the recent spate of music movies and their treatment of female characters: as scolds, sellouts and bad mothers – morality tales drenched in running mascara.Most of these women are fictional. (The exceptions offer moral instruction: Elton John’s mother gets a few barbed lines in Rocketman, telling him he’ll die alone. In Bohemian Rhapsody, Freddie Mercury’s ex-fiance’s contentment serves as one of the film’s many indictments of Mercury’s “lifestyle choices”.) The biopic wave has not buoyed real-life female musicians instead, female musicians on screen largely exist as a fictional axes for male auteurs to grind out their grievances about authenticity and fame.There’s Ally (Lady Gaga) in A Star Is Born, her pop success driving Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) to his death suggesting the demise of authenticity in an age where poptimism reigns. In Brady Corbet’s Vox Lux, Celeste (Natalie Portman) survives a high-school shooting and becomes a teen star when her earnest song for her lost schoolmates blows up. Corbet misses the opportunity to interrogate America’s taste for trauma by depicting Celeste as a conduit for destruction: somehow, her losing her virginity seems to bring on 911, and terrorists commit an atrocity while wearing her trademark attire.She is humbled by motherhood, as are Becky Something (Elisabeth Moss) in Alex Ross Perry’s gruelling and debasing Her Smell, and Rose-Lynn Harlan (Jessie Buckley) in Tom Harper’s Wild Rose. Even in Max Minghella’s forthcoming, relatively benign Teen Spirit, TV talent show hopeful Violet Valenski (Elle Fanning) is portrayed as an unstarry alternative to her brassier competition, disdain for pop slithering through a film that purports to celebrate it. By comparison, Ellie’s fate in Yesterday seems like a happy ending – inevitably, Jack sees the error of his ways. But again, she’s a morality check: Jack abandons success and decides to pursue an authentic life of reasonable expectations in Lowestoft. She is, of course, delighted.It is hard enough for real women in the music industry to be seen as autonomous without Hollywood undermining their efforts: minimising their presence, suggesting that female musicians are inherently inauthentic and incompatible with the demands of stardom, and that women in behind-the-scenes roles inevitably want to sleep with the male talent. Imagine there’s no women? We barely have to try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5198c1b602d14c8c1a88ae69842f2f7a207719a2/0_101_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a550322eacc241138fdc6031bad2a3f","title":"how to handle the impossible stress of cooking for other people wine helps","story":"Calmness is contagious, portion size is everything – and a boozy sorbet can perk up the most boring of guestsLast week I ordered a whole salmon but did not specify the size I required, because to have done so in a small family-run fishmonger would have been a jerk move. When it thwacked down on the counter, I’d say it was about the weight of a fully grown human thigh. They had to give it to me in a bin bag and I carried it down the road looking like I’d killed someone. But I had no anxieties about whether I had a big enough pan for it, or how long it would take to cook, or whether there would be enough for everyone I was cooking for, or what it would taste like, because I have been making magnificent large-scale catering errors since the 1980s.The worst thing that can happen when you cook for others is that you don’t make enough: trust me, this is more important than anything related to what it looks or tastes like. With raw animal instinct, everyone can assess instantly that there will not be enough they start polite, taking miniature servings that shame you to the core and trigger a catastrophic psychological reaction in all of them. Now they have had a tiny amount, they are ravenous, and nothing will satiate them. Plus they are quickly drunk, and so are you.Portion size aside, how best can you approach mass catering? The novice entertainer should look no further than Australian Women’s Weekly Cooking for Crowds. I first heard about it in the early 90s, on the radio, where I misheard it as “Cooking for Krauts” and thought “That’s a bit racist, but I’ll give it a whirl.” It teaches you a whole heap of 20th-century presentation faux pas, such as situating an olive slightly too centrally on top of everything, but it offers important lessons on quantity. Because there is also such a thing as too much.I was poaching this gigantic fish, per rule two: nobody comes to your house to watch you running about. There is no good way to do last-minute cooking in front of people. If you get very stressed, that is contagious, and if you don’t get stressed at all, they lose confidence in eating anything. In summer, poach fish, make vitello tonnato for meat eaters and bake savoury tarts for vegetarians. Rick Stein’s is the only hand you need to hold for the poaching of a whole fish, although he tends to mandate a huge amount of wine in the broth, which I always think is a bit Versailles. Vitello tonnato, an Italian dish of cold veal with tuna mayonnaise, sounds mad but is exquisite. I make it with pork and call it porkato tonnato. The best savoury tart book in the world is Tamasin Day-Lewis’s The Art of the Tart, though Yotam Ottolenghi has a roast garlic tart with the superpower of being able to deliver 17 different taste experiences in one go. It is a bit psychedelic, actually. In winter, go full stew, but always do one of those Gordon Ramsay scone or dumpling topping numbers, otherwise it will feel a bit like a school dinner.Opinion is ided about how fancy you need to be. My Mr believes that dinner-party food has to be as good as restaurant fare, otherwise why aren’t you in a restaurant? I believe that it has to be edible and look cute, and beyond that, nobody really cares. He will make a terrine so complicated (Simon Hopkinson) that you have to dismember a chicken and put it back together again in a completely different formation, a mixture of culinary and butchery skills roughly on a par with Hannibal Lecter. It will take four days and that will seem, to him, totally normal. I will make a chicken with 40 cloves of garlic (Richard Olney), which takes seven minutes to prepare, and still be quietly applauding myself the entire night.Back to the fish: my plan was to garland it with cucumber to look like scales, in an ironic nod to the ancient suburban housewife art form. It turns out this is incredibly hard, and you probably have to do an evening class to get it right. In fact, never assume you can do something just because you’ve seen it on TV a few times. Yet this brings me neatly to rule three, which is the critical audience: it doesn’t exist. There is a gratitude that is almost primal when you feed any person who isn’t one of your children: if it collapses, they laugh if it’s a ham en croute that looks like an unexploded parcel bomb, they rejoice. Only once in my life – when I made a potted shrimp (Sainsbury’s magazine, circa 2004) that was too stiff and incredibly packed with butter, and I asked my late uncle whether he’d like some bread, and he replied mournfully: “I suppose that might help” – did I have the trace of a feeling that it wasn’t quite right.If your friends are boring, serve a red wine sorbet at 11pm something about the sugar and the unexpected Dolby-surround-sound effect of red wine from two sources makes everyone perk up. Of course if you’ve got Tories round, you could just give them cocaine for the same effect, but I have no idea about cooking for Conservatives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cb676d4dface4f2f32699a5bd643ed7908dfe2b/2_0_7107_4267/master/7107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087522b3ade19bff44abecca6ecf88b7","title":"sixteen of the worlds greatest kitchen gadgets chosen by chefs","story":"From rice hacks to a 100-year-old rolling pin, cooks and food writers reveal the gizmos they could never do withoutGiven an unlimited budget, a keen cook could drop tens of thousands of pounds on the kitchen of their dreams. Yet often, even in the most smoothly finished set-up, it is tried-and-trusted, bashed-up equipment that we rely on the most. We asked some of our leading chefs and cookery writers to share which old gizmos and gadgets they cherish.Diana Henry, food writer and author of How to Eat a Peach“I’m not into gadgets. Equipment has to earn its space. My brothers gave me an ice-cream machine 26 years ago, when I got married. The marriage is long gone, but the Gaggia Gelatiera is as good as ever. Its white body is yellowed with age and, annoyingly, chunks of caramel and nuts get lodged around the dials, but it’s a workhorse. No parts have ever been replaced. It’s solidly reliable and it allows you to be wholly creative. That is a lot to offer a cook. It’s a bit bulky to hug, but occasionally I pat it and talk to it, willing it on when an ice-cream looks as if it may not freeze (pink grapefruit and basil, and tahini and lime, lately). It cost £240, a fortune then, but it was worth every penny. I will be heartbroken if it gives up the ghost.”Vivek Singh, founder and head chef, Cinnamon Collection, London“My lucky charm is a small, battered, beautiful brass mortar and pestle I’ve used since before we opened the Cinnamon Club in 2001. I use it to grind all spices during service. You don’t need tonnes of shop-bought ground spices. Grind what you need from whole and the flavours are much better. Brass is great: inert and easy to clean.”Sat Bains, chef-owner, Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham“About 30 years ago, I nicked a Sabatier roasting fork from Hotel Ristorante La Gondola in Derby, where I was working. It was a phenomenal place, which later became notorious after it featured on Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares. I loved that fork – I felt like Marco Pierre White holding it. It was quite a magical tool, but I was skint so I appropriated it. At home, I use it to cook steaks on the barbecue and for carving roast joints. It has a dirty wooden handle now and a kink from dropping it, but it’s history. I’ve also got a Dennis the Menace mug the team at La Gondola gave me when I left. Things don’t last 30 years any more.”James Cross, chef-owner, Lake Road Kitchen, Cumbria“When I was at Simpson’s in Birmingham my good friend Paul Insley gave me an old sterling silver butter knife he used for opening scallops. It’s long, flat, incredibly strong and, unlike a scallop knife, its rounded end never tears the scallop. Between us, it’s opened about 110,000.”Ravinder Bhogal, chef-founder, Jikoni, London“Growing up in Nairobi, visitors regularly dropped in and the kitchen was always full of women preparing chai and snacks. “Our guests are our gods,” was my grandmother’s mantra. These snacks included sev: spiced chickpea-flour noodles piped out of a brass sev sancha into scorching oil and fried to an off-the-Richter crunch. The batter sits in a main cylinder, to which you fit discs with various shapes punched into them, then squeeze the dough out using a manual lever. As a child, I coveted it like a toy and as an adult I first pilfered, then inherited it. I rarely use it, but I treasure it. In its patina is my grandmother’s coconut oil scent, her wit, her stories with a million digressions and her lesson in generosity: if you can share your snacks, you can share anything.”Stosie Madi, chef, Parkers Arms, Lancashire“We have a wooden rolling pin that is more than 100 years old. It belonged to Grandma Nolan, my business partner Kathy Smith’s gran. It’s totally smooth and, because we are constantly using it and polish rather than wash it, has an almost natural nonstick surface. No new rolling pin would create such even layers for a cheese and onion pie. We fight as to who gets to use it, but if Kathy is around she gets first dibs. It is irreplaceable.”Sai Deethwa, chef-owner, Buddha Belly, Birmingham“My mum runs a stall at Stroud and Gloucester farmers’ markets and I used to love her noodle wok, which was warped like the top of a heart from being lifted so often full of stir-fried noodles. The handle snapped recently and it’s funny how sad we were. I started out six years ago and my parents bought me a wok – a simple one from a Chinese supermarket I would recommend the chain Wing Yip. Now, after feeding thousands of people, it’s warped like Mum’s. It’s basic, but I cherish mine.”Josh Overington, chef-owner, Le Cochon Aveugle, York“During our research into traditional French cooking, we came across flamboir à lard, where you use a flambadou – a cast iron cone with a long handle heated to a glowing red – to quickly ignite and melt fat. Historically, it was used to sear joints of meat, but they are extremely rare now. We had one made and use it to render lamb fat as we cook oysters and langoustines. The flaming fat gives shellfish a distinct flavour most people haven’t tasted before.”Tom Kitchin, chef-owner, The Kitchin, Edinburgh“I first came across Microplanes when I was working for Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo in 2003 and I’ve used them ever since. They grate impossibly finely and not only are they precise (they zest lemons much more efficiently than standard graters) but they are also much smaller than the old-fashioned box grater – and space is premium in any kitchen.”Nieves Barragán Mohacho, chef, Sabor, London“Jumaco \u0026amp Maestro is a Spanish family business that has hand-built ovens since 1890. I’ve loved them since I saw one in Segovia years ago, but it wasn’t until Sabor that I could treat myself. Ours is a tall, stone, wood-fired cylinder in which food slowly rotates. For our suckling pigs, there is no other oven that treats meat so gently whilst achieving that crispiness you want on the skin. It’s the jewel of our kitchen.”Saiphin Moore, co-owner and head of food at Rosa’s Thai Cafe, nationwide, and Hoh Sek and Lao Cafe, London“In Thailand, parents hand down handmade bamboo pots and steamers to their daughters and my dad made loads of different sizes, which I brought to England. I’ve got some at home and the bigger ones at Lao Café. As a little girl, I remember eating sticky rice cooked in similar pots my mum had, but I also use the steamer to cook vegetables, chicken and fish. It’s a little taste of home. I love the subtle bamboo flavour and smell you get from steamers. They make everything more fragrant.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The Croat spent last season on loan at Stamford Bridge and, as part of that deal, is allowed to join the club despite a transfer ban.Fifa has handed Chelsea a two-window transfer ban, starting this summer, after a lengthy investigation into how they have registered players at their academy over a number of years. Chelsea have denied wrongdoing.The club appealed against the decision to the court of arbitration for sport this month but the ban has not been frozen.Chelsea signed Christian Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund in January but loaned him back to the Bundesliga club until this summer and Kovacic is ready to join the USA international as Chelsea’s second, and in all likelihood last, purchase before the new season.Kovacic made 51 appearances for Chelsea last season but failed to score. He joined Real Madrid in 2015 after two years at Internazionale but failed to hold down a regular starting place at the Bernabéu.Eden Hazard has left Chelsea, joining Real Madrid for an initial £88.5m in a deal that could rise to £130m. The club are hoping to appoint Frank Lampard as their manager this week, replacing Maurizio Sarri, who has joined Juventus.The new manager will have the chance to work with some of the club’s younger players, who have in the past been loaned out, and the striker Tammy Abraham is one of those hoping to get a chance.“This year is the most important year for us. It is now or never,” said the striker during the Under-21 European Championship. “There will never be a better time to play the youngsters.

It is in the name. How it promotes that message is the unique part. Between 27 June and 1 July, with the Women’s World Cup heading towards its climax, it will attempt in Lyon to break the world record for the biggest football match.This will be its third attempt at a world record. The campaigning collective holds the record for the highest altitude football match, on Kilimanjaro, and the lowest, by the Dead Sea in Jordan. This though, is another level entirely.“It’s a completely different challenge, in a way,” says Equal Playing Field’s Maggie Murphy. “At the top of Kilimanjaro, it was literally difficult to breathe. But in some ways, it was down to our training and our sheer will and teamwork.“With this one, because we are trying to expand beyond a set of 30 interesting women and we’re trying to now embrace a city, a location, fans from around the world. We’re trying to complement the Women’s World Cup, we’re trying to engage media, we’re trying to work with coaches, referees – so many more moving parts.”The task is massive. It needs 3,000 people to play and estimates it will take five days, playing non-stop day and night, with no half-time and with roll-on, roll-off substitutions for the duration. “When you actually start to break down 3,000-plus players, we’re looking at around 270 inidual 30-minute time slots,” says Murphy. “When you think about the substitutions, never before has a fourth official worked as hard as they will do during our game. Because literally every half an hour there will be upwards of 15 to 20 substitutions.”“We have some girls aged five that would like to come and play with their parents. And we have a couple of women in their 70s who have signed up as well. So all ages, all skill sets. We have pro players that are coming. We have complete beginners. And we have the UK parliamentarian women’s team that will be playing on Saturday.”Lyon, the biggest-spending women’s football club, pioneers and hosts of the World Cup semi-finals and final, have handed over their training ground to the event and Twitter and Adidas are on board as sponsors.“Maybe one of the challenges that we face is we’re not a big glossy charity event, we’re not a corporation,” Murphy says. “This isn’t a PR exercise. We’re literally asking for people who believe in the project to come join us.”Countries where Equal Playing Field have run football camps – including Palestine, Jordan, Lesotho, Costa Rica, Vietnam and Greece – are seeking sponsorship or fundraising to be part of the attempt. Alongside it, they have access to workshops and skills and coaching sessions.Adidas are funding the participation of five teams from five continents and the Association Football Development Programme is supporting the Costa Rican and Jordanian teams taking part.Equal Playing Field, in conjunction with Fifa, is running a five-day training programme for referees wanting to break into international officiating.These will run alongside the world record attempt, as will a series of workshops which will culminate in a summit on 5 July to look at the risks and benefits of the commercialisation and professionalism of women’s football, women in governance, women in coaching and many other aspects, drawing on the lessons of the week.“We’re not trying to break a Guinness world record for the sake of breaking the Guinness world record – we’re trying to inspire,” says Murphy. “But also equip those players, coaches and referees with some practical skills so that when they go back home they also feel a little bit more empowered to take action to level the playing field themselves.“So we hope that will inspire some players to go home and put themselves on referee courses or just to try out for the first team. But we also hope to inspire them to take action for others. So that might be to set up the girls’ team in the local school or help out with coaching at a local club. And just to get more involved and more committed to furthering the game.“We’ll show that when the World Cup finishes, and the cameras stop running, that thousands of people will still be continuing to push the agenda and make sure women’s football doesn’t slide off it for another four years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34241d7a958a24bc0a52be6a3ba502580b55aae8/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29099b8b43e65da8f49d78a88564c97f","title":"tell us about the one lifestyle change that worked for you","story":"As part of a series exploring how one change can make a profound personal impact, we want to hear from youWhat is the most impactful lifestyle change that you have made that has improved your health and wellbeing?

The series, based on the real-life adventures of the Yorkshire vet James Herriot, originally ran on BBC1 from 1978 to 1990, and is now being given a fresh interpretation by Channel 5.The six-part series, a co-production with the American broadcaster PBS, is due to start shooting on location in Yorkshire this year. The series, which includes a Christmas special, will air next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the original publication of Herriot’s much-loved books.Sebastian Cardwell, the digital channel controller at Channel 5, said: “James Herriot has a special place in the heart of the public and the commission of this iconic drama series, against the stunning backdrop of the Yorkshire Dales, is set to bring joy to a new army of TV viewers.“The original books affectionately captured a unique slice of British life. In challenging times we hope the charming and heartwarming stories of community and compassion will resonate with new audiences.”The production has not yet announced the casting for the lead role. Christopher Timothy played Herriot in the original series, which also starred Robert Hardy, Peter Davison, Lynda Bellingham and Carol Drinkwater. At its peak, All Creatures Great and Small pulled in audiences of more than 13 million.The new series will be created by Playground, the production company behind the hit dramas Howards End and Wolf Hall, with a promise to remain faithful to the books of Alf Wight, James Herriot’s real name.“It is a responsibility we take very seriously,” said Colin Callender, chief executive of Playground. “The series will embrace the fun and nostalgia of revisiting the England of the past, while celebrating Herriot’s values that, despite all our current upheaval, still underpin British life today.”The bucolic depiction of country life seems a far cry from the Channel 5 of old, the former home of Big Brother. Its schedule was once described as “films, football and fucking”.However, the broadcaster has made a return to quality drama in the past year under Ben Frow, Channel 5’s director of programmes. This includes Cold Call, which is set in a woman’s prison, and 15 Days, a murder mystery set at a Welsh farmhouse.In 2010, the BBC commissioned a three-part series, Young James, based on the earlier years of Herriot’s career. It was filmed and set in Glasgow, the city where Wight learned his trade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184e36b21e830f84edabaa23c9795090adaec1c1/770_666_2412_1448/master/2412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37135ced12922af69d9b94c92b80ea10","title":"thom yorke amina review","story":"The Radiohead frontman gives a glimpse of his fun side on this intriguing, infuriating solo album. But you’ll have to listen closelyIn one sense, Thom Yorke’s new solo album makes for an intriguing study in contrasts with its predecessor, Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes (2014). That album was quietly slipped out one Friday afternoon accompanied by a press release that concentrated less on the music itself than its experimental delivery via pay-gated BitTorrent files and what that might mean for the industry. Five years on, Anima arrives on an old-fashioned record label, preceded by a lengthy interview in which Yorke detailed the album’s themes (“a sense of anxiety … expressed through a dystopian environment,” he offered, blindsiding anyone assuming Anima would offer more of Yorke’s carefree party anthems), and by an accompanying film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.It’s tempting to say that’s where the differences between Anima and its predecessor end. You could reasonably ask, without being snarky, what the point of a Thom Yorke solo album is. After all, Radiohead are a pretty expansive band. They’re evidently not under any pressure to knock out hit singles, they pack out stadiums while playing pretty anti-stadium material and, while resolutely not a one-man show, they’re clearly driven by their frontman’s artistic vision. So what’s the itch that can’t be scratched within their confines? Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes suggested Yorke’s solo albums are largely a repository for electronic material that isn’t focused enough for the day job, and this one follows suit.The gulf between Anima and Radiohead’s most recent official release, the Moon Shaped Pool outtake Ill Wind, certainly isn’t one of mood. Both are twitchy, paranoid, filled with dark intimations about the future. Both take what you might call the Yorke worldview: that life is a waking nightmare and everything is completely and perhaps irreparably screwed. In fairness, Yorke has been carrying on like this for decades, over the course of which he has gone from a grumbling Jeremiah to a man dealing in irrefutable truths.Instead, the differences are largely down to structure and melody. Ill Wind has a beautiful tune floating over the song’s jazzy changes. By contrast, Anima’s nine tracks were constructed by Yorke sending sprawling electronic jams to producer Nigel Godrich, who edited them down.Fans might note that this process is not dissimilar to the one used to make Amok, the solitary album by Yorke’s side project Atoms for Peace, and, as with Amok, you can tell. There’s a preponderance of dance rhythms – post-dubstep beats and bass behind Traffic’s massed samples of Yorke discordantly harmonising, two-step garage periodically galvanising the meandering Runawayaway, whispers of drum’n’bass breakbeat on Twist. And yet there’s very little of dance music’s propulsive dynamics. The songs tend to settle on one point and stay there, layering on intriguing sounds without moving forward.Sometimes this works. Last I Heard (He Was Circling Down the Drain) becomes an oddly tense experience as it appears to build up to a climax that never comes. Sometimes it makes tracks seem scrappy and underdone: Not the News clatters to a halt just as it appears to be getting started. The Axe’s repetition of “I thought we had a deal” is the closest Anima comes to anything as vulgar and crowdpleasing as a hook or a chorus – for the most part the melodies feel fragmentary and vaporous.That said, Anima packs plenty of nice moments into its nine tracks – among them the point midway through Twist where it appears to become a different song entirely, its fidgety agitation giving way to something both calmer and more eerie, linked to the first part by only the slenderest musical threads. The music on Dawn Chorus, meanwhile, is almost as lovely as the real thing – lovely enough to make you wish it was topped with something other than a monotonal sprechgesang vocal. The bassline on I Am a Very Rude Person is a fantastic, serpentine thing. Moreover, from its title down, it offers evidence of Yorke’s sense of humour. “I’m breaking out the turntables, now I’m going to watch your party die,” he sings, neatly surmising his fabled DJing appearance on the web series  Boiler Room, where he seemed to be enjoying his own selections considerably more than anyone else in the club.There are clever sounds and intriguing samples: the muted double bass that underpins The Axe, the mass of chaotic orchestration that briefly overpowers Not the News, the dubby bassline of Impossible Knots. Among the extraneous stuff accompanying its release, the fact that Anima’s deluxe vinyl edition comes hardback-bound seems fitting. This feels like a glimpse through an artist’s sketchbook, interesting rather than essential.Burial – ClaustroBreakneck UK garage recast as something simultaneously floor-filling and eerie – its female vocals and poppy hook set amid crackle, distortion and unexpectedly ominous chords."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37c968420d61b01edbd8281a7d523c991e1db28/0_0_4869_3317/master/4869.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=783e65767359c6b937390d826637cc3c 1760w","title":"welcome to glastonbury 2019 in pictures","story":"Wednesday saw the early arrivals, a dazzling fireworks display – and the first night of after-dark debauchery "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0b7cd86e3e7bda5ed22c75821e7ef99c498270/0_207_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14cd8904226a1e646f99813b958d695","title":"ebola is back can it be contained podcast","story":"The current outbreak of the deadly virus in the DRC has been called the most complex public health emergency in history.

A parliamentary standards committee deemed it “serious misconduct”.A recall petition in September narrowly fell short of the numbers needed to unseat Paisley. The latest allegation will test the loyalty and forbearance of his constituency and his Westminster colleagues.Paisley has made no public response to the report, which raised the number of visits he is known to have made to Indian Ocean resorts over a three-year period to five.The BBC reported last December that Paisley took a complimentary holiday with his family to the Males in 2016 after advocating on behalf of its government, which has been accused of human rights abuses. He did not register the holiday in the parliamentary register of interests.Paisley said it was paid for not by the Malian government but partly out of his own pocket and partly by a friend, who he declined to identify.This week’s follow-up report cited three sources, including a resort owner, who identified the benefactor as Shainee, who was then a minister.The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, urged the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, to sanction the MP. “Ian Paisley’s Males jetsetting has already disgraced his office and earned him a record suspension from Westminster. These new revelations further degrade his reputation and they degrade trust in politics,” Eastwood said.

It will be up to my successor to take this forward, to find the majority in parliament that I was not able to find on this issue and to deliver the decision of the British people in 2016.”A late-night altercation between Tory leadership favourite, Boris Johnson, and his partner, Carrie Symonds have changed the dynamics of Johnson\u0027s campaign. He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.His bizarre claim to make model cardboard buses has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson’s character – he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life – would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that late-night police visit will have on his chances.\u0026nbspHe has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was \u0027eminently feasible\u0027, although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was \u0027do or die\u0027.He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects – London’s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted \u0027Boris island\u0027 airport – perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on \u0027global Britain\u0027, it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats – both UK and foreign – and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman\u0026nbspNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeIt is highly unlikely there would be a majority for a no-deal Brexit, with several Conservative MPs, including Ken Clarke, Philip Lee and Dominic Grieve, committed publicly to voting against a Tory government in a motion of no confidence, if that were the only way of preventing it.Asked whether she could understand their motivations, the prime minister said: “This is an issue on which people feel strongly.”His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an \u0027underestimated\u0027 entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the \u0027Theresa in trousers\u0027 nickname among some Tory MPs.His campaign team have decided to take the fight directly to rival Boris Johnson though, with Hunt taking part in a Twitter Q\u0026ampA session as a direct response to Johnson\u0027s refusal to appear on a Sky TV head-to-head debate. The hashtag: #BoJoNoShow.He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than rival Boris Johnson.Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. He has argued that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far.Hunt backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for \u0027sensible tax incentives\u0027 to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this.A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson. This has been a key part of his pitch.But she added: “As far as I’m concerned, I believe there should be a Conservative government in the UK, because a Conservative government is better for the people of the UK.”The prime minister was speaking to journalists en route to the G20 summit in Osaka – her final major international meeting before she leaves 10 Downing Street next month.She resisted expressing a preference between Johnson and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt.But she repeatedly used the formula that whatever happens next in the Brexit saga must be “good for the United Kingdom”.That would appear to rule out a no-deal Brexit, which she has warned in the past would be damaging – and declined to pursue earlier this year, when her own deal was rejected.The race to succeed the prime minister has been dominated by the risks of a no-deal Brexit – with Johnson backed by many of the “Spartans”, who are relaxed about the prospect, which they regard as a way of escaping the controversial Irish backstop.Both Johnson and Hunt have insisted their first course of action would be to seek changes to the backstop, with Johnson also suggesting he would “disaggregate” the withdrawal agreement, and withhold the £39bn financial settlement until after Brexit.But May appeared to cast doubt on the likelihood of those strategies being successful, saying: “The EU has made its position clear. We negotiated a good deal with the EU.”The prime minister was left with little choice but to resign, after the withdrawal agreement her government painstakingly negotiated with the EU27 was rejected three times by parliament, and talks with Labour failed to yield a way through the deadlock.Asked whether she would do anything differently if she had her chance again, she said: “I did what I believed to be right in the interests of the country. Sadly, when it came to it on three occasions, I was not able to achieve a majority in the House of Commons for that decision. I think it’s right that somebody else will now take up that mantle and lead the country forward.”May said she intended to stay on as the MP for Maidenhead after stepping aside and did not rule out standing as a candidate in the next general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ff89b03f2db556d742fccc2a0b736918bbe344/0_28_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83b648114a1b399bc8661a8d3bff7bc","title":"female jockeys took cheltenham glory but underestimated punters horse racing","story":"• Research reveals backers’ bias against women riders• Parity in rides for men and women at least 50 years offThe betting public is behind the times in its assessment of female jump jockeys according to a statistical analysis of 1.6 million rides over the last 18 years which was released by the British Horseracing Authority on Thursday. The study also suggests that while female riders outperformed their male counterparts at the Cheltenham Festival in March, parity in the number of rides for men and women will not be achieved for another 50 years on the Flat and almost a century over jumps.“This analysis seems to suggest there is a significant difference between the material performance of female jump jockeys and the public perception of their capability,” Cashmore said.“The betting public consistently underestimate these jockeys. This could be an indicator of negative public opinion about the ability of female riders but also ensures there is value to be found in backing horses ridden by female jockeys in Jump races. I hope this research can move us another step closer to altering attitudes towards female jockeys and more importantly, driving behavioural change.”Three female jockeys – Bryony Frost, Lizzie Kelly and Rachael Blackmore – rode winners at this year’s Cheltenham Festival, with Blackmore adding a Grade One success on the 50-1 shot Minella Indo in the Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle to her win on A Plus Tard, the 5-1 favourite for the Close Brothers Novice Handicap Chase, on the opening day.Tallulah Lewis, the chair of Women In Racing, said on Thursday that WIR is “delighted to be able to support Vanessa as she continues her ground-breaking research.”Lewis added: “Riding a racehorse requires a high level of skill and strength which are abilities that can be developed by both sexes, with opportunity being the crucial final component. Vanessa’s research makes clear that if women have the same opportunities as their male counterparts they can compete very successfully as jockeys, just as they can in any other sphere in racing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f13703a90c30ca467b852da93396a445e8217841/0_241_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0238b4b85dbaa4050d56b2e6e4de9f4","title":"muirfield golf club invite women join first time 275 year history","story":"Female members have been formally invited to join the world’s oldest golf club at Muirfield for the first time.The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who are based at the East Lothian Links, voted to change their controversial membership policy barring women two years ago.

But both those options have downsides: if tracking is turned off entirely, some Google products and services no longer work, while deleting activity manually can be a chore, particularly for users with more than one Google account.In May, the company launched the ability to delete saved information automatically after a fixed period of time (three or 18 months are the only options). The feature initially only covered “web and app activity”, but now, Google has announced its expansion to location history.Again, users have been able to delete location history manually through a fairly hidden setting on the Google Maps timeline, where an unlabelled trashcan icon in the bottom right of the screen will clear history. But this marks the first time a user can easily track their movements in the short term while regularly cleaning their records.The setting is not yet available on the web, but users of the iOS and Android Google apps will start to see the setting as it “rolls out”, the company says. That should allow the best of both worlds, allowing users to gain some of the benefits of location history, like looking up the name of that nice cafe they wandered into last week, without the risk of building up a long-term record of their every movement.Other activity records still need manual attention. The company allows users to manually delete recordings of their voices made by the Google Assistant, and their search and viewing history on YouTube, but will not yet automate those deletions, although users can again opt out of storing that information entirely.And all of those settings only affect Google’s consumer-facing records and personalisation. The information the company collects for adverts is a mandatory part of using Google services, although a separate setting allows users to turn off ad personalisation.“You should always be able to manage your data in a way that works best for you – and we’re committed to giving you the best controls to make that happen,” Google said in a statement when it first announced the new controls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5efc8557ee4dc3bdea20de9dd833060d93c16e7/545_1728_2898_1739/master/2898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3274e09c214f81ff03ba903dab8cc7e","title":"whats the best cheap tablet or e reader for pdf files","story":"Thomas needs a device to read A4 PDFs of technical papers that is cheaper than a good laptopI am looking for an e-reader for technical papers. These are usually only available in fixed, non-reflowable, PDF format and sized for printing on A4 paper. They cannot be read on a typical e-reader such as a Kindle because the text is too small. I don’t need the fancy note-taking capabilities of options such as the Remarkable PDF reader. Can you recommend something that doesn’t cost as much as a decent laptop? ThomasThe main attraction of Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) is that people can read the files on almost any kind of device. The corollary is that almost any device will work as a PDF reader, including smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops running almost any operating system. Indeed, so many people need to read PDF files for business and educational research purposes, there are e-readers designed for the task.Your challenge is to balance things like text clarity, screen size, portability, battery life, ease of use, versatility and price to arrive at the best choice for your personal needs.Most of us prefer versatility. A smartphone is not the best camera, notebook, word processor, audio recorder, radio, MP3 player, map reader, pedometer and so on, but it is good enough replace numerous separate devices for most people most of the time. In this case, you seem to want a dedicated device, where the extra features of, say, convertibles running Microsoft Windows 10 are more of a drawback than a benefit.However, dedicated devices need to outperform general-purpose devices to find a market, and they will still sell in much lower volumes. As a result, they will be relatively expensive.If you are buying something for business purposes, reconsider your approach to pricing. I calculate the number of hours of use per week, and the number of years of use, to get a cost-per-hour. I compare this against the cost of labour (salary plus overheads), and calculate benefits such as time savings and the ability to work when it would otherwise be impossible.When people are earning £25,000 to £250,000 a year, it’s generally easy to demonstrate the economic value of expensive devices. Even if you’re a student and not earning anything, you can still value your time.Mass market e-readers such as Amazon Kindles are designed to replace printed books, so they tend to be around the size of a novel, only thinner. They have E-Ink screens that – unlike laptop screens – are readable outside. They don’t require much battery power, so they can run for many hours between charges. They are exactly what you want, except for their screen sizes.For your purposes, the best screen size would be 210 x 297mm, which is the same as A4 paper. This has a diagonal of 14.3in, so a 14in screen would be closest to life size. However, a 12.3in to 13.3in screen should be perfectly acceptable.The other key point is the aspect ratio of 1:1.414. Since you can’t get A4, the best match would be a device with a 3:2 screen, such as a Microsoft Surface Book or a Google Pixelbook. These screens have an aspect ratio of 1:1.5.The next best would be either 4:3 (1:1.333), which was used by traditional TV sets, or 16:10 (1:1.6), as used by, for example, Apple’s MacBook Pro. The 4:3 format lives on in screen resolutions from 640 x 480 (VGA) to 1440 x 1080 and 1920 x 1440, while 16:10 resolutions include 1440 x 900, 1920 x 1200 and 2560 x 1600.However, E-Ink screens are much easier on the eyes.The reMarkable PDF reader is really targeted at the digital writing market, rather than the digital reading market, though most serious e-readers support pens for annotations and signatures. Instead, consider the Onyx Boox range, which includes seven e-readers with larger screens. The top models – the Max 2 ($749) and Max 2 Pro ($849) – would be best for your purposes, because they have 13.3in screens. The 10.3in Note Pro ($599), Gulliver Note ($449) and 9.7in Euclid ($319) are cheaper but smaller options. As you know, reducing the size of PDF images makes them harder to read.According to the the-ebook-reader website, Boyue is about to launch a Likebook Alita which “looks strikingly similar to the Onyx Boox Note Pro. Their shameless copying of Onyx is starting to get kind of creepy. Half their software features were taken from Onyx’s software and now their hardware is a near replica too.” Judging by comments, Boyue has some software problems, too…The Onyx Boox and Likebook ranges are based on Android 6.0.1, and therefore might be able to run alternative PDF readers from the Google Play store. Check first if you intend to try this. However, most Android apps are not designed to run on high-resolution e-ink screens.As mentioned, you could buy a more versatile device such as an Apple, Android or Windows tablet. These have more features than e-readers, but they don’t havee-ink screens or such good battery life. Worse, if you buy one with decent screen resolution, you may not save any money over an e-reader.Android tablets are cheaper, and worse, but you could buy a 10.6in Huawei MediaPad M5 for £299. Its 2560 x 1600-pixel Quad HD screen – which has a 16:10 aspect ratio – might make this the best, cheap PDF reader without an e-ink screen.Obviously there are much cheaper Android tablets with 10.1in screens, such as the Lenovo Smart Tab P10 (£199) and the Acer Iconia One (£129). However, you pay the price in terms of lower screen resolution. Lenovo’s P10 has a 1920 x 1200 screen, while Acer’s Iconia is down to 1280 x 800 pixels. Both of these are 16:10 ratio screens.Google’s 12.3in Pixel Slate offers 3000 x 2000 pixels, which is nice, for £749, which is not. No wonder Google is getting out of the tablet business.Have you got a question?

There are dorms sleeping 4-6, or single and double en suite rooms, some with a terrace. There’s also a communal kitchen, games room, cinema and a multi-use venue, which hosts live music, karaoke, comedy, workout sessions –you can even “perform for your dorm” if you are a musician, and stay for free.• Dorm beds from £20pp, doubles from £67, room only, steelhousecopenhagenThis hostel sits on a hill in the quiet medieval village of Torre del Colle in the Umbrian countryside. It’s split across several buildings, including a 10th-century former school, with accommodation ranging from dorms to en suite rooms with terraces. There’s an outdoor pool on a raised deck and gardens hosting communal barbecues. Breakfast comes with views of the Assisi valley and Monte Subasio in the Apennines, and the kitchen serves plenty of pasta dishes at other times.

Last year, she narrowly missed out on winning I’m a Celebrity … in which the Inbetweeners actor “found some new love and respect for myself”, presumably not while Holly Willoughby was panic-flicking giant cockroaches off her body with a cue card. Since then, her Instagram followers have grown in number from 70,000 to 1.4 million, she has done standup about her roaring 20s, has released a clothing range and is writing a book, which I can only assume is about how Atack found new love and respect for herself in the jungle, the standup tour, the clothing range and the book. You might ask what is left. A preposterously overpaid column in a rightwing newspaper? Leader of the country?No, the inevitable consequence of all this is Emily Atack: Adulting (W), a reality TV series in which Atack, with the help of family, friends, and that most trusty of agony aunts, social media, sets herself a bunch of “adulting challenges”. These are less about putting on the Fill Your Face helmet in the Bushtucker trials and more like taking her cousin’s stepdaughter to soft play – which many find more terrifying than a kilogram of mealworms heading up their nose holes.At this point, it is worth issuing a warning that, if you find the concept of “adulting” – which essentially means the completion of such quotidian tasks as working, laundry and taking care of oneself what the rest of us call living – as infantilising and sexist as I do, you might want to bugger off and do some quiet, unscripted adulting of your own right now.If, on the other hand, you embrace the toddlerisation of everything from politics to smoothies, this is all “very relatable”, to use the appropriate reality-TV terminology. Off Atack bounces to show us the house that she has somehow managed to find since leaving the jungle, which most adulting adults will never be able to afford. Here is the bed that she chose on account of it having a massive television hidden in the frame, which sounds both cosy and like a Trumpian nightmare. The problem is that it is way too big for the space and didn’t actually come with a telly.“It’s a disaster!” Atack wails. At which point, I started fantasising about the mirror image of this series, in which a naughty woman over the age of 60, such as Miriam Margolyes, gads about kidulting: playing Twister and throwing enormous tantrums about putting on her shoes. I know, it is never going to happen. But we said that about so many things.Mostly, instead of considering the issues millennials face – being unable to afford further education, or fending off constant carping about being snowflakes – Atack ponders how she would look with a baby bump and makes a feeble gag about her “hungoveries”. She asks Instagram – that well known moral influence on young women – whether she is ready. (The answer is … cruel.) She goes to visit her mother, the actor Kate Robbins, most famous for doing the female voices on Spitting Image, who recalls Atack’s brother being more than 10lb when he was born. “Was that uncomfortable?” Atack wonders. “Why do you think I haven’t got any boyfriends,” her mother bats back. And they laugh.Finally, because it is not truly revealing unless you invite the camera behind the curtain to film a scan of your uterus, Atack goes to see a fertility doctor. The good news is that she has average fertility for a 29-year-old, can have children and isn’t going to worry about it any more. The bad news? Adulting proves that, along with the Spice Girls, Tony Blair and a whole host of other pretend-good 90s ephemera, the ladette is back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0bd1ee209cf6cbc3a4669c849b0b02b767a20/0_11_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f5c82086065fccbde3fd5d4433d97","title":"why are we like this the psychology of procrastination","story":"From deleting social media apps to setting limits on your screen time – here’s how to deal with the existential malaise of putting off the important thingsYou know that thing you’ve been putting off doing? Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible.

One anonymous writer shares their experiences of navigating the claim gameEveryone hates doing their expenses. It can feel like the admin equivalent of purgatory. So perhaps it’s no surprise that some of us employed in the creative industries have been known to extend our creativity to the task of claiming expenses.We’re not talking about nefarious fraud or fiddling, of course – typically it’s just about deploying a little imagination to avoid the boredom of doing them diligently. (Mind you, filling in overtime sheets for the hours spent poring creatively over an expenses claim could appear like gaming the system.)The trouble is, there are lots of grey areas. So when a car hire company chooses to reward a frequent renter with a red-blooded sports machine instead of the decidedly ordinary vehicle booked at the same price, that’s perfectly OK, right? Except that the snarling beast, even if driven at puppy-like speeds, uses twice the fuel. I must admit I felt a little guilty when I put in that claim for petrol.Ditto when I claimed for the cost of fuel for a work trip, without specifying that the petrol was high-grade aviation gas for refuelling a small plane, rather than supermarket-pump unleaded for a car.The UK’s HMRC collects some of the most outrageous attempts by taxpayers to claim spending as legitimate business expenses. My current favourite fail is insurance for a pet dog, at more than £750 for a year.One of the most common abuses is padding out expenses, usually by putting through additional claims for mileage because it’s so difficult to track and report on accurately.But some companies don’t exactly help themselves. A manager at a magazine house I worked at decided to circumvent his bosses’ ban on extra payments for overtime by telling the hard-working staff to put in fake expenses claims. Amazingly, that overflowing gravy train continued on its phantom branch line for years before it hit the buffers.I’ve also known managers to start bargaining over the percentage of a particular claim they are willing to allow, which just creates moral confusion over whether the expense is legitimate or not – and therefore undermines the credibility of the entire system.Other companies use archaic or cumbersome expenses software that is so time-consuming and difficult to use that it invites claims that are rounded – usually upwards, of course – or generously misremembered.A colleague tells me he feels no guilt at putting in claims for a few hours of renting light planes to keep his pilot’s licence – needed for work – alive. They may be enjoyable, sun-filled low-level jaunts over delightful countryside, but they are also vital for his job.I’ve also known people to claim for the rental of a fast car, along with the fuel and the necessary hotel stops, for a continental trip instead of taking an airliner – on the basis that it worked out at roughly the same cost. But this was before the days of ultra-low-cost airlines.And even before the recent moves to crack down on bribes, small gifts to ease the flow of commerce or information would routinely be described on expenses claims as “drinks”. Obviously, some of these actually were drinks. But the moral difference can sometimes feel murky when you start pondering whether buying multiple rounds of whisky for someone is substantively different from giving them a bottle of whisky.The question of what constitutes a legitimate expense is often far from straightforward. For instance, I once found myself facing a tricky moral dilemma when a speed-gun-wielding traffic policeman demanded a fine that was almost exactly equivalent to the cash float I had for upcoming expenses. In the end, I put it down to experience and did not doctor a claim to recoup the money. But I could have elected to do the opposite.It works the other way round too, though. The first time I went to Tokyo I was so appalled by the price of food that I didn’t eat for the first two days, despite being able to claim any such expenditure back.And I’ve never put in a claim as breathtakingly bizarre as some of those from British politicians that were revealed during the MPs’ expenses scandal that broke in 2009 – just a few examples of which include a duck house and £30,000 in gardening costs, two toilet seats, and labour costs to replace light bulbs. When lawmakers flout the rules, it does rather encourage lesser mortals to adopt a jaded view of the morality of keeping to them.According to a research paper on expense compliance issued in 2019 by software company SAP Concur, a fifth of employees found exaggerating claims acceptable, with those aged 18 to 24 even more likely to regard making false claims as normal. Fortunately, it’s now easier for businesses to manage the risk of fraudulent claims and ensure compliance with the help of automated expense management technology, such as Concur Expense. Technology can also make it much harder for employees to pad out mileage Concur Drive, for example, can track mileage while you’re driving and automatically populate an expenses claim.The rot can start early. I remember, as an impressionable teen, my then-girlfriend’s father telling me that when he was studying at Cambridge he was kept on an extremely tight financial leash by his father, who demanded to see minutely itemised accounts of his spending. Only after a couple of years did it dawn on the holder of the purse strings that his son was consuming an inordinate number of cream teas per week. In fact, roughly as many as the pints of beer any other student might consume …Fortunately my girlfriend’s dad went on to a glittering career in academia, so never had to revisit his talent for creative accounting. But the issue is still pertinent: the research found that low pay was one of the four main reasons given for guilt-free expense fiddling.My favourite story, though, involves a crisis of conscience by a foreign correspondent working for a national news organisation (not this one) in a country far, far away. He made so much money massaging his expenses that, on leaving the post, he felt he should present the office fixer with a car. He didn’t, however, tell the delighted recipient that it was paid for with just a small part of the hack’s pile of guilt-tinged lucre.SAP Concur provides intelligent solutions to help your business automate expenses on the go – giving you more freedom and the visibility you need to run your business more effectively.

Footage showed Merkel being offered a glass of water, which she declined with a shake of her head.A photographer for the German news agency dpa said the politician looked better after she began to move again.Merkel, 64, was attending an event marking the departure of the justice minister, Katarina Barley, who is leaving to become an MEP, and the swearing-in of her replacement, Christine Lambrecht, also of the Social Democratic party.The chancellor’s plane to Osaka took off from Berlin’s Tegel airport at 1.17pm CET. Over the course of a packed three-day summit, Merkel will be taking part in talks on free trade, climate change and regulation around artificial intelligence, as well as seeking bilateral talks with French president Emmanuel Macron about the vacant role of the new European Commission president.On 18 June Merkel was seen shaking during military honours for the visiting Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Temperatures had been slightly cooler on Thursday morning, with around 17 degrees at 10 am CET.Apart from annual fixtures like the summer walking holiday with her husband Joachim Sauer and a visit to the Wagner festival in Bayreuth, Merkel has kept a consistent line in separating her public persona from her private life.In keeping with that line, most German media outlets have reported on Thursday’s public event but refrained from speculating in detail about the cause of the shaking bout.“Those who try to find political meaning in Merkel’s shaking,” wrote centre-right broadsheet Die Welt last week, “distract our attention from her politics, which are hard enough to decode as it is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb01e68abff84444f7a4901e48c18ef1fc3703c6/755_40_3801_2282/master/3801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c3f9174469b8b7dc6c2b0292c59acb0","title":"dutch railway to pay out 50m over role in holocaust","story":"State-owned operator transported 102,000 Jews to Nazi death camps The Dutch railway has accepted a recommendation that it pay up to €50m (£45m) to relatives of thousands of people it transported to Nazi death camps during the second world war.Roger van Boxtel, the chief executive of the state-owned Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), said it was time for the company to make a gesture to those “directly involved” as he reiterated an apology first made in 2005.A commissioned report recommended the railway make an offer to about 500 survivors of the camps and 5,500 next of kin.The decision marks the end of a three-year battle by 83-year-old Salo Muller, a former physiotherapist at Ajax football club, whose parents were transported from Amsterdam to the Dutch transit camp Westerbork, from where they were taken to Auschwitz and gassed.Muller wrote a book, published in 2017, titled See You Tonight and Promise to Be a Good Boy, in memory of the last words his mother said to him as she dropped him off at kindergarten before she was picked up that day by the SS.Despite its expression of regret 14 years ago, the railway company had rejected the idea of compensation until Muller threatened legal action, supported by a prominent Dutch human rights lawyer, Liesbeth Zegveld.The Nazis paid NS a sum equivalent to £2.2m in today’s money for delivering 102,000 Jews to concentration camps across Europe. The last train left on 13 September 1944, shortly before a large part of the NS staff went on strike in an attempt to hasten the end of the German occupation.Westerbork, whose inhabitants included Anne Frank before she was moved to Auschwitz, was established by the Dutch government in 1939 as a refugee camp for Jews fleeing occupied Europe but it was taken over by the SS after the German invasion.Under the compensation plan outlined by the commission and accepted by the railway company, offers will be made of €15,000 (about £13,400) to each survivor, €7,500 to widows or widowers and €5,000 or €7,500 to victims’ children. The company expects to pay out between €40m and €50m.The commission’s chairman, Job Cohen, said deciding on the sums had been “extremely complicated”.In 2014, the French railways operator SNCF agreed to pay £40m in compensation for its role in moving approximately 76,000 Jews to Nazi camps during the Holocaust."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/562b9e09288e2938a853741bbe2ca7ff51022e42/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=287ec8ad97782c81c31ca030fed65148","title":"libya un recognised government captures gherian","story":"Strategically significant victory in Gharyan puts pressure on General Haftar’s backers Egypt and UAEForces loyal to Libya’s UN-recognised Government of National Accord say they have captured a strategic town from General Khalifa Haftar, the warlord mounting a deadly siege of the capital, Tripoli.GNA forces were shown on social media celebrating in Gharyan, a town 50 miles south of Tripoli that served as a supply line for Haftar. The GNA’s air force chased convoys of soldiers from Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) leaving the city, and inflicted further casualties.Although frontlines have swung back and forth in Libya, Haftar’s forces appeared to acknowledge a reverse, reacting angrily and claiming a counter-attack was already under way.The LNA reverse, if it holds, appears to have been preceded by a series of local tribes demanding an end to the fighting or specifically calling on Haftar to retreat. The development places pressure on Haftar’s international backers, primarily Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Until the frontlines supplied overseas have largely held, or positions recaptured soon after they were overrun.The change in the military climate appears to be matched by a diplomatic upswing for the UN-backed government, including a GNA decision to resume cooperation with France. The GNA had ended cooperation, accusing the French president, Emmanuel Macron, of covertly backing Haftar. France, especially the foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has been accused of seeing Haftar not as an autocrat but as a bulwark against political Islam and Islamist militia that dominate the weak GNA forces. The reconciliation occurred following meetings in Tunisia between the GNA and France.Haftar’s attempt to capture Tripoli has been seen by Italy, and to a lesser extent the UK, as an attempt to destroy elaborate efforts by the UN special envoy, Ghassan Salamé, to form a genuine government of national unity leading to elections.The LNA forces appear to have misjudged the degree to which militia inside Tripoli would switch sides and join Haftar once he appeared at the southern gates of the capital.The UN has said nearly 700 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced since the attack was launched on 4 April.A fortnight ago the GNA prime minister, Fayez al-Serraj, revived a version of the UN peace plan including a national forum and elections by the end of the year. Serraj ruled out Haftar joining the reconciliation process.There have also been talks between GNA members and the UN over a UN-led audit of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL), seen as one means of ensuring a better distribution of resources between east and west of Libya.The head of the CBL, Saddek Elkaber, met the deputy UN special envoy in Libya, Stephanie Williams, to discuss the match between revenues submitted by the Libyan National Oil Corporation and the figures audited by the CBL.Salamé himself met Haftar this week in a move that was criticised by Tripoli-based forces, some of whom accused him of corruption.Haftar for his part has given a relatively rare interview insisting he is not an anti-democrat, and would only take power on an interim basis to prepare for these elections."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Judge says he will inquire into why attempt to seek wardship was not complied withFinance minister stands over appointment of Gabriel Makhlouf despite NZ inquiry findingTomasz Paszkiewicz admits stabbing Marek Swider with knife used in job on meat plant \u0026lsquokill floor\u0026rsquoSolicitor for Bar BQ Tonight on Clanbrassil Street says incident led to regularising of workersAnnouncement from Department of Agriculture follows RT\u0026Eacute revelations on greyhound industryZoo part of European breeding programme for endangered western lowland gorillasIncident closes two lanes of section of northbound motorway, hugh tailbacks resultPaul O\u0026rsquoBeirne and Jeffrey Morrow on trial for 2016 murder of 25-year-old in FinglasPeamount Healthcare apologises for failings in care of Kathleen Leech (68) in nursing homeFianna F\u0026aacuteil, Sinn F\u0026eacutein critical of ministers over spending on children\u0026rsquos hospitalDaniel De Jong alleged pines on college grounds put his property at risk from falling debrisFire warnings issued as Thursday forecast to be hottest day of the year so farPdforra tells Oireachtas committee members \u0026lsquowant to see report good, bad or indifferent\u0026rsquoSandycove, where algal orange slick was spotted, to remain closed for another dayGarda\u0026iacute appealing for witnesses to early morning single-vehicle crash near LoughreaHealth authority claims planned investments in new facilities now impossiblePaul Reid appears before PAC says if projects affected it\u0026rsquos likely to be those slated for 2020-21UN data shows street price of heroin in Ireland in 2017 was \u0026euro136 per gramUnion in dispute with Government over pay rates for support personnel in health service"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3939404.1561640948!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"immediate review of issuing of knackery licences to be held","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister of State at the Department of Agriculture Andrew Doyle said there needs to be proper traceability of dogs similar to databases that exit for cattle. An immediate review of the issuing of licences for knackeries will be conducted, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture Andrew Doyle has said.The announcement comes after an RTÉ Investigates programme on Wednesday highlighted the practice of some knackeries euthanising greyhounds for as little as €10 to €13 per animal. Knackeries are not allowed to kill greyhounds.The programme also exposed that the greyhound industry is overbreeding by a factor of 10 and many greyhounds, who do not perform, are being shot illegally.The programme highlighted an unpublished report commissioned by the Irish Greyhound Board (IGB)and carried out by Preferred Results which revealed that of 16,000 greyhounds are born in Ireland every year.About 6,000 are killed because they failed to make qualification times or their performances declined.Mr Doyle told RTÉ radio’s News at One that it was not acceptable in any sort of civil society to have animals treated in this way.However, he said that the majority of greyhound owners loved their animals and would not condone such behaviour. “This is a minority that have tarnished the entire sector.”As a farmer and a person who cares for animals himself, he found the details revealed on the programme “totally revolting,” he said.

He said that since he took up his position in 2016 the industry has gone through a number of reforms and more will come about because of the Greyhound Racing Act of 2018.There needs to be proper traceability of dogs similar to databases that exit for cattle, he added. Mr Doyle said there is no doubt that the sector will come under pressure to make changes, there will have to be assurances from the industry that they are determined to improve their reputation and that “the people who treat their animals like this are exposed.”It had been “horrific” to see footage of animals “being treated like that in this State.”There will be an immediate review of the issuing of licences to knackeries, some of which will be revoked “if that’s what it takes,” he says.

Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill Temporary swimming bans at Seapoint and the Forty Foot in Dún Laoghaire have been lifted by Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council. However, a ban at Sandycove Beach remains in place after test results showed elevated levels of E.coli and enterococci. Results form further sampling will be available on Friday, the council said. Sandycove beach was also the location of an orange slick on Tuesday, which the council later said was a naturally occurring algal bloom, caused by nutrient rich water and warm temperatures. The council said the algal bloom did not test positive for sewage. Partially treated waste water was released to Dublin Bay by the Waste Water Treatment plant at Ringsend. The discharge followed heavy rainfall on on Sunday and Monday last . Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council said “it should be noted that all other bathing areas in the area such as White Rock and Killiney Beach continue to be open, safe for swimming and unaffected.”Dublin City Council said it expects results of testing of water samples from Dollymount beach on the northside of the bay on Thursday afternoon. It will then make a decision on whether to lift a bathing ban there. Following the discharge, Green Party Leader Eamon Ryan said 30 million litres of sewage had been “pumped into Dublin Bay”. He said it was shocking that “people cannot enjoy the beach or go for a swim in the summer because it has been polluted to an unsafe level.“This contamination of our beautiful beaches and pristine water has been continuing unchecked - Dublin Bay is recognised by UNESCO as an internationally important biosphere but the Government is not protecting it.”Former Cathoairleach of Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Ossian Smyth took issue with the length of time required for testing. He called for “same day water quality testing, pre-emptive warnings following heavy rain and major sewage system upgrades to make sure people know that swimming in these conditions is unsafe and to prevent this happening again”.In north Co Dublin, Fingal councillor David Healy the pollution was is “the result of decades of under investment in our sewage infrastructure”. Mr Healy was echoing the words of Irish Water spokesman John O’Donoghue who said the utility was playing catch up, in modernising the infrastructure after years of underinvestment.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignComment: Never underestimate Jeremy Corbyn, or the cowardice of the Labour MPs who oppose himTory leadership race: Commit to no-deal Brexit or don’t serve in my cabinet, Boris Johnson threatens French nudists and burkini bathers in heatwave pool standoffNigel Farage tells European Parliament that undeclared donations were to help him become US TV star American woman killed by sharks while snorkeling in Bahamas with her familyFirst British female climber to lead two successful expeditions on Mt Everest reflects on the peak\u0026#39s \u0026#39dark side\u0026#39Libyan government forces take strategic town in battle for TripoliConcern over Angela Merkel\u0026#39s health as German chancellor seen shaking for second time this monthComment: Boris just might have the answer to Britain\u0026#39s immigration troublesPolice officer killed as double suicide blasts rock Tunisia capitalMuirfield Golf Club finally admits its first women members, 275 years after it openedBoris Johnson\u0026#39s no-deal Brexit stance: from \u0026#39do or die\u0026#39 to \u0026#39one in a million\u0026#39Public at serious risk from failure of police to take DNA in sex and violence cases, warns watchdogComment: Plotting no-deal chaos shows how desperate Remainers are to be right about BrexitThe true story of why this single mother was beaten to death in her South African homeBoris Johnson’s Australian-style points system unlikely to bring migration numbers down, MPs warnBoris Johnson: I have a very good relationship with Ruth Davidson and will strengthen the UnionTheresa May warns Boris Johnson against suspending Parliament to deliver no-deal BrexitTheresa May warns Boris Johnson against proroguing Parliament to get Brexit doneWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/28/TELEMMGLPICT000194102761_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_nrDFz5WxMWkdtNYw7K1ZWo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"women want get pregnant should move countryside improve fertility","story":"Women who want to have children should consider moving to the countryside to improve their fertility, scientists have suggested following a new study.Research in Italy found women living in polluted areas are likely to have a shorter window in which to conceive due to the damage done by toxic particles to their ovarian reserve.The results showed a “reproductive disadvantage” even in areas significantly less polluted than the official European limit, which some parts of the UK regularly breach.They corroborate recent research from the US which indicates that smoking can hasten the menopause by as much as two years.Professor Antonio La Marca, who led the new study at the University of Modena,...Register for free to read this article, or log in to your  accountThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

as a method for controlling bad behaviour.  Almost all (95 per cent) of nursery teachers said they are not even allowed to call a child “naughty” in their nursery.Danielle Butler, a director at Tommies Childcare which runs nurseries in  Coventry, Derby, Kenilworth and Nuneaton, said they adopt a “holistic” approach to managing behaviour. “The term ‘naughty’ is one that has held negative connotations particularly in an Early Years context,” she said.“There is the potential for children to be labelled with this term, without them being able to understand why their behaviour is unacceptable.”   Ms Butler said that word “naughty” is not used her nursery, adding that she discourages any words “that label children’s behaviour in a negative way”.  Matthew Byrne, director of Crafty Wizards pre-School in south-east London, said that they do not call children “naughty” on the basis that “it can negatively impact on how others see that child, from their peers to the adults around them”.He added: “The child might not be following adult instructions, playing within social norms of behaviour but they are not intrinsically naughty.”Amy Alderson, a director at Tops Day Nurseries, said they believe in “promoting good behaviour through positive re-enforcement”.She added: “We avoid secluding or reprimanding children for undesired behaviours and refrain from labelling children’s behaviour as ‘naughty’.“If a child was throwing hard blocks in the classroom, we would help them identify the impact of their behaviour and they would be re-directed to throw the bean bags in the throwing zone.“Re-direction enables children to practice the skills they need to develop in a way that is socially appropriate.”She said that repeat incidents of bad behaviour can, as a last resort, lead to children having “thinking time”, where they reflect on their behaviour.Tory leadership race: Commit to no-deal Brexit or don’t serve in my cabinet, Boris Johnson threatens French nudists and burkini bathers in heatwave pool standoffNigel Farage tells European Parliament that undeclared donations were to help him become US TV star American woman killed by sharks while snorkeling in Bahamas with her familyFirst British female climber to lead two successful expeditions on Mt Everest reflects on the peak\u0026#39s \u0026#39dark side\u0026#39Libyan government forces take strategic town in battle for TripoliConcern over Angela Merkel\u0026#39s health as German chancellor seen shaking for second time this monthComment: Boris just might have the answer to Britain\u0026#39s immigration troublesPolice officer killed as double suicide blasts rock Tunisia capitalMuirfield Golf Club finally admits its first women members, 275 years after it openedBoris Johnson\u0026#39s no-deal Brexit stance: from \u0026#39do or die\u0026#39 to \u0026#39one in a million\u0026#39Public at serious risk from failure of police to take DNA in sex and violence cases, warns watchdogComment: Plotting no-deal chaos shows how desperate Remainers are to be right about BrexitThe true story of why this single mother was beaten to death in her South African homeBoris Johnson’s Australian-style points system unlikely to bring migration numbers down, MPs warnBoris Johnson: I have a very good relationship with Ruth Davidson and will strengthen the UnionTheresa May warns Boris Johnson against suspending Parliament to deliver no-deal BrexitTheresa May warns Boris Johnson against proroguing Parliament to get Brexit doneWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/11/01/TELEMMGLPICT000145122476_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGQR7TMwEvfaYG0TH6J-Ry5xWLfs5mAvkbXYQqrLnBas.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"extra 1000 ivf actively harms chance having child many couples","story":"Louise Brown, known for being the first human to be born through IVF One of the most popular forms of IVF which costs £1,000 extra actively harms the chance of having a child for many couples, according to a new study.Britain’s leading fertility experts have condemned unscrupulous doctors after a study indicated the technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) makes parenthood less likely for half of all couples.Developed in the 1990s, the method involves injecting a single sperm cell into an inidual egg, rather than simply mixing sperm and eggs in a dish, as happens in standard IVF.The £1,000 uplift comes on top of the roughly £3,500 couples are charged for IVF if, as is happening more frequently, the NHS refuses to pay.Register for free to read this article, or log in to your  accountThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

We need to remember and respect those that still remain on Everest the trauma for those families whose loved ones who never return.“Ms Gilbert, who is based in Grantown-on-Spey in the Highlands, summited the 8,848m (29,030ft) peak from the TibetanChinese side days after a photograph emerged showing dozens of climbers queuing on the busier Nepal side.The congestion during this year’s pre-monsoon climbing season was blamed on the deaths of two climbers who had a long wait at more than 8,000m, in the so-called “death zone”.As the number of climbers on Everest increases, so too does the death toll, amid calls on Nepal and China to limit permit numbers.According to Ms Gilbert, an expedition leader for the Lake District-based company Adventure Peaks, the queue was not remarkable, it just so happened that someone was able to take a picture of it.On her own expedition she believes she may have passed as many as 50 dead bodies.She writes that the accolade of making a piece of British mountaineering history is a “distraction”, and the real motivation behind her story is to share her thoughts on a side of Everest rarely talked about – “the cost of human life” and its impact on those who climb.She recounts the “humiliation” of going to the toilet at altitude where “everything is on display”, the necessity of being joined at the hip and sharing a sleeping bag with your Sherpa.Before the final push she shared life and death advice, in broken English, that she exchanged with her sherpa Phirinhee: “If you cold, we turn around. If me cold, we turn around.”They passed parties of people who had summited, who she described as “walking wounded” and her heart sank when they approached the first steep wall and saw a stationary head torch illuminating a lone body, which slowly moved into an upright position.The female climber had lost a glove and Ms Gilbert realised with a shock: “Oh God, we knew her.“I shouted at her to fight for their life, I checked her oxygen which was still good and glanced for the lost glove but no joy.“Kirsty (a doctor an member of her group) unclipped herself from the rope, shuffled along the ledge and reinforced everything I said. Fight for your life and keep moving. Fight for your life and keep moving.“As we left I couldn’t help asking myself if I should have done more, this was a decision that plagued me for the next few days, let alone hours.”After that she started counting the dead bodies. “The first was sitting down just off the path, knees bent, and head slumped. I felt sick. They kept on coming. If you shone your head torch off the path you would see another body.“They were wedged down rock crevasses, on ledges and next to the path. Nobody spoke. It came to the point that I became too frightened to shine my head torch off the path in fear of seeing another body.” As they approached a “famous ladder” on the second step to the summit their head torches illuminated another body, hanging from ropes, that they would have to squeeze past.Ms Gilbert said her tears welled up, and she was sick in her mask. She mistakenly thought she knew the dead climber.She adds: “I pulled myself together and continued up with the rest of the team, desperately trying to not shine my torch at the empty shell or touch him. “We summited at 0600 on the 24th in perfect conditions. The Weather Gods took pity on us for once. Strangely enough none of our team felt like celebrating and we probably spent no more than 10 minutes failing miserably to take photos since our camera batteries had frozen.”The next day, at advanced base camp, their Tibetan cook had walked up with Coke and Sprite that she described as the best liquid they had had in days.She adds: “Over the next few days at base camp and on our way back to Lhasa, the team slowly started to speak about summit day and start to experience the joy that an expedition like this should provide. We all needed time to re-adjust and reflect on what had been a very intense experience.  “As I write this, I have been back in Scotland for a week. I’ve cleared the desk from the admin that these expeditions generate and spent hours in my garden. I’m still trying to process everything that happened and rationalise my decisions. “I’ve probably come across as dismissive to friends who asked me about my latest adventure and been reluctant to speak too much about it. When you speak about it you must relive it which can be hard.“Over time, the trauma will heal, and the joy of success will shine through. We need to remember and respect those that still remain on Everest the trauma for those families whose loved ones who never return.”She recalls, when asked why she keeps returning to high altitude that she once read that “without death, life has no meaning”.“In my experience, there is nowhere else that you experience death first hand like on Mount Everest.“Life isn’t a dress rehearsal and by pushing myself to the limit every now and then I appreciate my life so much more. I appreciate the little things in life and I fill my life with people that inspire me. I love the explosion of my senses when I return from barren places and I want to share these feelings and emotions with kindred spirits. Team members and Sherpa’s alike who share the Everest experience together will have a bond between them, a bond that can’t be explained, replicated or broken.”Comment: Never underestimate Jeremy Corbyn, or the cowardice of the Labour MPs who oppose himTory leadership race: Commit to no-deal Brexit or don’t serve in my cabinet, Boris Johnson threatens French nudists and burkini bathers in heatwave pool standoffNigel Farage tells European Parliament that undeclared donations were to help him become US TV star American woman killed by sharks while snorkeling in Bahamas with her familyLibyan government forces take strategic town in battle for TripoliConcern over Angela Merkel\u0026#39s health as German chancellor seen shaking for second time this monthComment: Boris just might have the answer to Britain\u0026#39s immigration troublesPolice officer killed as double suicide blasts rock Tunisia capitalMuirfield Golf Club finally admits its first women members, 275 years after it openedBoris Johnson\u0026#39s no-deal Brexit stance: from \u0026#39do or die\u0026#39 to \u0026#39one in a million\u0026#39Public at serious risk from failure of police to take DNA in sex and violence cases, warns watchdogComment: Plotting no-deal chaos shows how desperate Remainers are to be right about BrexitThe true story of why this single mother was beaten to death in her South African homeBoris Johnson’s Australian-style points system unlikely to bring migration numbers down, MPs warnBoris Johnson: I have a very good relationship with Ruth Davidson and will strengthen the UnionTheresa May warns Boris Johnson against suspending Parliament to deliver no-deal BrexitTheresa May warns Boris Johnson against proroguing Parliament to get Brexit doneWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/27/TELEMMGLPICT000098467844_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqe5jTtuvhyhg4PHi86V8a0uHC4uooAYptTLzL00kNATY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"muirfield golf club finally admits first women members 275 years","story":"Opening its doors: Muirfield will admit its first women members in JulyThe first women members are to be finally admitted to one of the country’s most historic golf clubs, more than two years after it was decided to allow them to join.Muirfield Golf Club announced yesterday that a dozen women will become members next month for the first time in its 275-year history, following its decision in March 2017 to reverse a previous ban on female membership.But the club, home to The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, defended the two year delay in inducting women, saying it was in fact quicker than the usual waiting time for would-be members.Muirfield came under increasing pressure to admit women as full members after the R\u0026ampA took it off the list of venues with the right to stage the Open, following a vote in 2016 which failed to reach the two thirds majority required for a rule change.Scotland\u0027s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Muirfield\u0027s position at the time as simply indefensible.The blacklisting of Muirfield by the R\u0026ampA forced a second vote in 2017, when members at the privately-owned club voted by more than 80 per cent in favour of admitting women.The first will walk through its doors next month to coincide with an extensive refurbishment of the club, including improvements to the women’s locker room.Alistair Campbell, captain of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, said: “This marks a milestone in the Club’s illustrious history, and we look forward to welcoming all of our new members to share in the great values and traditions of our club.“This year marks the 275th anniversary of the club’s first recorded golf competition. We are proud of our club’s rich history but equally excited for its future and the part all of our new members will play in the club’s cherished traditions.”Sources at the club suggested that far from facing a long delay to become members since the vote gave the go-ahead, the 12 had in fact been admitted far quicker than average.They pointed out that it can be a painstakingly long process to gain admission, with prospective members having to be nominated and seconded before going into “the pool” or waiting list, with an average waiting time of six to seven years. During this time they are expected to ‘make themselves known’ to existing members by playing as guest and attending club functions.“It might seem like a long time between us voting to admit women and the first women members joining, but by out standards this is quite quick,” said the source. “Some candidates have even had to wait up to 12 years.”The clubhouse has had some significant work done, adding a new Ladies Locker Room and new roof terraceThe twelve women, two of whom are overseas candidates, have now successfully progressed to this final stage of the approval process and have now been formally invited to join.The issue has split the world of Scottish golf, with several women players deeply critical of “entrenched” sexist attitudes in the sport towards their participation.Writing anonymously in Golfworld magazine under the name Holly, a single-digit handicap player and long-time member of two Scottish clubs said: “In the more historic and entrenched clubs there is still a resistance. At those, I am regularly asked why I’m not home doing the cooking and the cleaning. That would be funny if those men were joking. The older generation is dominated by dyed-in-the-wool misogynists.“Disappointingly, albeit from a small number, I still see chauvinism in younger male golfers. Mostly though, the juniors and younger boys are far more advanced when it comes to gender equality.”Writing about Muirfield, Holly added: “The course is great, but the club not so much. That it required the second vote to allow female members hints to what women are walking into. However, there is a principle at stake.”The renovated Muirfield Clubhouse, which was originally built in 1891, houses an enviable display of the sport’s  history and memorabilia. This includes the ’13 Rules of Golf’,the earliest known written rules of the game, which were drafted by the club in March 1744.Comment: Never underestimate Jeremy Corbyn, or the cowardice of the

evil almost beyond compare and we had to be apologetic about the British Empire, for all eternity, even during ITV’s Sunday night pm to pm slot.Latest result of this self-loathing is Beecham House, a lavish and expensive, not to mention dreadful, new ITV drama which is supposedly set in  Delhi but can be far more accurately carbon dated to the early st century period between March , when Poldark took his top off, to .pm on Christmas Day, .That was when the last ever episode of Downton Abbey finished, ITV execs panicked and suddenly thought: “Oh s***. We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island. If Joe and Lucie were “Jucie” and Jordan and Anna “Jordanna”, did that make Elma and Scottish Anton “Elma Fud” NEVER a good sign when you can tell a show’s going to be a disaster just from the furniture.But that was the case with last Tuesday’s big political bun fight, on BBC, which looked more like a dating show or fire sale at Louis Walsh’s gaff than a debate to decide Our Next Prime Minister.It sounded like it as well, from the way host Emily Maitlis kicked off, barking: “Five men. One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry. Stop the game” – and told host Richard Ayoade: “You must be clever ’cos I’ve got the mind of a genius and you’ve made me laugh.” She also attempted to create some sort of mystique around “The GC” tag, claiming it was nothing to do with her initials and inviting alternative suggestions from Carol, who remained diplomatically silent, evenI’d swear you could see in the thought bubble above her head  . . . “Gigantic consonant vowel consonant consonant.”THE Real Chernobyl proving the perfect accompaniment to Sky Atlantic’s show of the year.Susanna Reid’s digestive tract going into deep spasm when Geoffrey Boycott asked her out for lunch, on another unmissable Good Morning Britain.Top Gear’s Chris Harris attempting to drink a glass of water while being electric-shocked by Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness.And Alien Fun Capsule host Harry Hill responding to Stephanie Beacham name-dropping former Dynasty husband Charlton Heston: “Yeah, Charlton Heston. He was slumming it a bit after Ben Hur, wasn’t he ”ITV has just one brilliant comedy show. Harry Hill’s Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by Paul Hawksbee and Dan Maier.Slightly to my surprise, I’ve learned it also has a Head of Comedy called Saskia Schuster, who’s just told something called the Diverse Festival – and what a laugh riot that sounds – she will no longer commission shows written only by men.In the great sweep of ITV history, the possibility exists, of course, that someone has made a more stupid, pointless, self-defeating, virtue-clogged, brain-fart of a commitment than this one.It’s just that I can’t think of it at the moment.LAURA Bassett: “She had her arms by her side behind her body.”Casey Stoney: “Cameroon have got that no-lose attitude, eventhey lose.”Jordan Nobbs: “If England keep believing, the second half will come.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resign!” were directed at the homelessness minister Heather Wheeler.In an email written before she took up the role, Wheeler described rough sleepers in her constituency as “the traditional type, old tinkers”.The words were leaked and, lo, the outrage flowed hot and predictable. The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The respected IFS think tank warned Mr Hunt will either have to raise borrowing or cut spending on public services to afford his lavish promiseshe becomes PM. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson warned there was a piece of the jigsaw missing after Mr Hunt pledged £bn more for defence and a £bn corporation tax cut. He told the BBC: The plans feel incomplete... You couldnapost do all the things weaposve just talked about and still argue youaposre going to have debt falling... and end austerity. It feels like thereaposs a rather large missing part to this jigsaw puzzle.It comes days after the IFS also found Boris Johnsonaposs spending plans wanting.The think tank said his plan to give a tax cut to people on more than £, would cost £bn and mainly benefit the top % of earners.    Todayaposs IFS analysis says Mr Huntaposs promises would exacerbate pressures on public finances. And it suggests the Foreign Secretaryaposs proposals would ultimately require spending cuts, tax increases or higher borrowing. Cutting the main rate of corporation tax to .% would cost £bn a year in the short term, the research says. Even though some of this will flow back to the UK through greater investment, the move will never completely pay for itself, Mr Emmerson said. Meanwhile an extra £bn would be spent on the defence budget in four yearsapos time as a result of Mr Huntaposs pledge to increase spending to .% of the national income. The IFS analysis says Mr Huntaposs proposals would amply the long-run challenges to the public purse.    It comes as the UK is facing spending pressures from an ageing population and rising health costs. Mr Huntaposs combination of policy proposals would exacerbate these pressures and widen a gap in the public finances that will ultimately need to be filled through some combination of higher borrowing, tax increases or cuts to other areas of spending, the report adds. Mr Hunt has pledged to turbo charge the UKaposs economy, partly in a bid to apply pressure on the EU during any post-Brexit trade talks. The IFS says the corporation tax cut from the current level of % would not pay for itself because it is too big for it to be plausible that higher profits could outweigh revenue losses. But reducing it to the level of Irelandaposs could eventually cost less than the prediction as it would probably encourage greater investment in the UK, the report says.

A £ billion increase, alongside the proposed corporate tax cut, would leave no scope to relieve the pressure on other areas of public spending without tax rises or a fiscal stance which risked putting debt on a rising path, he said.

His mum, Meriel and late father Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt had to deal with the tragic death of his little sister, Sarah, when she was just  months old. Hunt, , spoke about the tragic accident when he appeared on ITVaposs Peston last night. He had told ITVaposs political editor Robert Peston he would be happy to talk about the tragedy beforehand. Local newspaper the Kensington Post covered the inquest into Sarahaposs tragic death at Westminster Coroneraposs Court in March . Coroner Gavin Thurston heard how Sarah drowned in the bath as the familyaposs nanny prepared their dinner. Jeremy was in the bath with Sarah when the tragedy happened at the family home in Kensington. The inquest was told how nanny Dianne Brady had left the children in the bath for aposabout five minutesapos. When she ed to the bathroom she found Jeremy, then two-and-a-half, sitting at the end of the bath. Sarah was lying face upwards. Jeremy told Miss Brady: Sarahaposs asleep. Miss Brady tried to revive Sarah but she died on the way to St Charles Hospital in Kensington.  Mr Huntaposs father Commander Hunt praised Miss Brady after the Coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: We have had Miss Brady with us for about six months and we think sheaposs absolutely marvellous and both children absolutely adored her. Giving evidence at the time a distraught Miss Brady said had put the children in the bath in about five or six inches of water and had then gone to their bedroom to lay out pyjamas. Then she went to the kitchen to get Sarahaposs dinner ready. She explained she had dficulty in finding the babyaposs bottle and she also put the spin drier on. She told the Coroner that the drier was quite noisy and that she thought all this had taken about five minutes.  During his ITV show last night ITVaposs political editor Robert Peston said to Mr Hunt: Rather extraordinary about your childhood, which I was completely unaware of, which is that you had a baby sister who tragically died, could you just tell me a little bit about what that was  Hunt replied: Well, I donapost talk about that normally. And actually I wouldnapost say that this is something that has affected me emotionally because she was just a few months old when she died in a terrible accident and I was too young to ever remember it. He added: I do know it affected my parents, before Peston interrupted him to say: But it must have affected you. It must have affected you though, donapost you think  This is the sort of tragedy that has a profound affect on families. Mr Hunt, who has a younger brother Charlie, said: Well I was only two-years-old so itaposs not something I have any memories of. But as I say, I do know it affected my parents. Maybe when I met parents who had lost children in the NHS... maybe that triggered something in me.

Though Clark is a fine scholar, I was unconvinced by his title, which suggested the great powers stumbled mindlessly to disaster. On the contrary, the maddest aspect of  was that each belligerent government convinced itself that it was acting rationally. It would be fancul to liken the ascent of Boris Johnson to the outbreak of global war, but similar forces are in play. There is room for debate about whether he is a scoundrel or mere rogue, but not much about his moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth. Nonetheless, even before the Conservative national membership cheers him in as our prime minister – denied the option of Nigel Farage, whom some polls suggest they would prefer – Tory MPs have thronged to do just that. I have known Johnson since the s, when I edited the Dailyand he was our flamboyant Brussels correspondent.  I have argued for a decade that, while he is a brilliant entertainer who made a popular maître d’ for London as its mayor, he is unfit for national office, because it seems he cares for no interest save his own fame and gratication. Tory MPs have launched this country upon an experiment in celebrity government, matching that taking place in Ukraine and the US, and it is unlikely to be derailed by the latest headlines. The Washington Post columnist George Will observes that Donald Trump does what his base wants “by breaking all the china”. We can’t predict what a Johnson government will do, because its prospective leader has not got around to thinking about this. But his premiership will ­almost certainly reveal a contempt for rules, precedent, order and stability. A few admirers assert that, in office, Johnson will reveal an accession of wisdom and responsibility that have hitherto eluded him, not least as Foreign Secretary. This seems unlikely, as the weekend’s stories emphasised. Dignity still matters in public office, and Johnson will never have it. Yet his graver vice is cowardice, reflected in a willingness to tell any audience whatever he thinks most likely to please, heedless of the inevitability of its contradiction an hour later. Like many showy personalities, he is of weak character.  I recently suggested to a radio audience that he supposes himself to be Winston Churchill, while in reality being closer to Alan Partridge. Churchill, for all his wit, was a profoundly serious human being. Far from perceiving anything glorious about standing alone in , he knew that all dficult issues must be addressed with allies and partners. Churchill’s self-obsession was tempered by a huge compassion for humanity, or at least white humanity, which Johnson confines to himself. He has long been considered a bully, prone to making cheap threats. My old friend Christopher Bland, when chairman of the BBC, once described to me how he received an angry phone call from Johnson, denouncing the corporation’s “gross intrusion upon my personal le” for its coverage of one of his love affairs. “We know plenty about your personal le that you would not like to read in the Spectator,” the then editor of the magazine told the BBC’s chairman, while demanding he order the broadcaster to lay off his own dalliances. Bland told me he replied: “Boris, think about what you have just said. There is a word for it, and it is not a pretty one.” He said Johnson blustered into retreat, but in my own files I have handwritten notes from our poss-ible next Prime Minister, threatening dire consequences in printI continued to criticise him. Johnson would not recognise truth, whether about his private or political le,confronted by it in an identity parade. The other day I came across an observation made in  by Bishop Berkeley: “It is impossible that a man who is  to his friends and neighbours should be true to the public.” Almost the only people who think Johnson a nice guy are those who do not know him. There is, of course, a symmetry between himself and Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn is far more honest, but harbours his own delusions. He may yet prove to be the only possible Labour leader whom Johnson can defeat in a general election. If the opposition was led by anybody , the Tories would be deservedly doomed. As it is, the Johnson premiership could survive three or four years, shambling from one embarrassment and debacle to another, of which Brexit may prove the least. For many of us, his elevation will signal Britain’s abandonment of any claim to be a serious country. It can be claimed that few people realised what a poor Prime Minister Theresa May would prove until they saw her in Downing Street. With Boris, however, what you see now is almost assuredly what we shall get from him as ruler. We can scarcely strip the emperor’s clothes from a man who has built a career, or at least a lurid love le, out of strutting without them. The weekend stories of his domestic affairs are only an aperit for his future as Britain’s leader. I have a hunch that Johnson will come to regret securing the prize for which he has struggled so long, because the experience of the premiership will lay bare his ­absolute unfitness for it. If the Johnson family had stuck to showbusiness like the Osmonds, Marx Brothers or von Trapp family, the world would be a better place. Yet the Tories have elevated a cavorting charlatan to the steps of Downing Street, and they should expect to pay a full forfeit when voters get the message. If the price of Johnson proves to be Corbyn, blame will rest with the Conservative party, which is about to foist a tasteless joke upon the British people - who will not find it funny for long.

But then the family faced another problem as Chloe was given a seat on her own at the back of a plane. The crew had to switch passengers around so the family could sit together.   An easyJet spokesperson told : “ Although Ms Quick and her family travelled on their flight, we are sorryit was not communicated clearly at Bag Drop that volunteers would always be sought at the gatesufficient seats were not available. We are looking into this with our ground handling partners at Palma Airport. Once onboard the cabin crew arranged seating together for the family. We do our best to look after young families, including providing regular and specic information encouraging them to check in online as early as possible so they can be seated together before arriving at the airport. We also send this information to third party bookers, including Thomas Cook and ask them to share this with customers.” As a scheduled airline, easyJet can sell more tickets than available seats on the plane but they must ask for volunteers before offloading people. A spokesperson for Thomas Cook said: We are very sorry that Mrs Quick and her family experienced this issue on theirflight and have asked easyJet to look into what happened.

Having stumped up £ each for the get away, the graduates expected the pad to boast a private pool, barbecue area and gorgeous ocean view. But when they arrived the hovel had a broken washing machine outside, the windows were boarded up and the pool was green and empty. It was also not in the village they thought it would be, but on a remote site eight miles away from the address advertised online.    Criminology student Rachael said the group was assured that everything was fine before they flew out on June  for six days. The -year-old said: “We were really excited to go away and had booked our trip in March. “But we arrived at Villa Veronica in Bulgaria to find it was abandoned and derelict.” The students are set to graduate this summer from the University of Portsmouth. They say they were forced to shell out for a hotel after the travel booking website offered poor alternatives.   And they have slammed Booking for their slow response which they say left them with nowhere to go for  hours.The group had chosen to stay in the villa because of its proximity to Old Nessebar, a Unesco World Heritage Site. But when they arrived at Burgas Airport at am they were told that the address on the website did not exist.    Instead, the real villa was actually in the coastal village Sveti Vlas and up a muddy hill with no shops, beach or restaurants nearby. Rachael said: “It looked absolutely awful when we arrived, our faces just dropped. “The pool was empty and green, the windows were boarded up and there were tools and a washing machine in the garden.    “The front door was obstructed with cable and wood and the barbecue facilities were disgusting.”The group immediately alerted  Booking  and asked them to sort out a suitable alternative.But they were forced to spend the first day of their holiday surrounded by suitcases on a beach jampacked with tourists.    Rachael said: “We rang at midday and they asked us to go back for our original check-in time. “So we paid for a taxi and stood around in the mud and rain to find it in the exact same state unsurprisingly. “But when we rang back, they just said they would start looking for alternative accommodation, which we’d asked them to do ten hours earlier. “And when they sent over some options an hour later, which were all awful, they told us we had to pay the cost upfront.” Eventually, the group took matters in their own hands and booked a hotel themselves, which left them £, out of pocket. The group then began the fight to get an immediate refund on the sham villa. Rachael said: “After asking time and time again to speak to a supervisor, one agreed to send us an email confirming we’d be refunded and receive £ in compensation. “But when it arrived in writing, it said the money would be paid in local currency so it was actually around £.”    The students finally booked into their new accommodation - which didn’t have a private pool or self-catering facilities - at pm that night. Rachael said: “We had to pay for expensive hotel food when we thought we would be able to cook ourselves. “We made the best of it but it cast a shadow over the holiday and left us out of the pocket. “We stressed our concerns even before we left and were not taken seriously before we went or when we got there.” And when the group arrived home on June , they were shocked to find the villa was still available online.Rachael said: “We posted about it on social media and emailed them but the only response I got was on Twitter .“We just want people to know what can happenthings go wrong.” The students have since received a full refund.   A spokeswoman for  Booking  said: “Our overarching aim is to facilitate smooth and enjoyable travel experiences for our customers, empowering them to experience the world wherever and whenever they choose.“As such, we are available   to answer any questions or concerns our customers may have, especially in the very rare instance that something unexpected might occur at the property. “Because we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that this group encountered, we have offered a full refund for their original reservation, as well as covering any relocation expenses incurred as a gesture of goodwill. “Our team is also investigating with this property as ensuring customer expectations are met is one of our top priorities.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons royal baby name","story":"NewsKate Middletons royal baby name blow - as public prefers Zara Tindalls choiceThere is a clear winner between which name comes out on top between Charlotte and MiaShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience WriterAmber Hicks:,  JUN NewsThe name Charlotte ranked number  in the top  names \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKate Middleton has lost out on the most popular royal baby name and been pipped to the post by Zara Tindallaposs daughter.We exclusively revealed this week the most popular baby names of  so far.And while the Duchess of Cambridgeaposs daughter Charlotte ranked  on the list, Zaraaposs daughter Mia got one up on her cousin and scooped fth place.

Chy Wall, , has painfully admitted her le has gone dull since two-year-old son T-Jay Dedman died in November. She had left the youngster for “literally seconds” in an upstairs bedroom playing with her friendaposs daughter, two, when the tragic accident happened. T-Jay fell from the first floor window of a house in Tuebrook, Liverpool, and was found on the pavement outside by a passerby.He died in hospital six days later, reports the Liverpool Echo.Following an inquest yesterday,  which concluded his death was accidental, Chy told how her “bright blue-eyed” little boy brought happiness to every aspect of her le.She said: “He changed my le completely.  “He was a total loony. Mischievous, but not naughty.“Everyone who met him loved him. He made everyone laugh. “We went everywhere together. He wouldn’t even let me go the toilet without him following me.” Senior Coroner Andre Rebello told the court how on November , , T-Jay was found on the pavement outside a house having fallen from a first-floor bedroom.  Just seconds earlier, his mum had left the toddler playing with her friend’s daughter. The toddler was rushed to hospital. However, despite treatment, his condition deteriorated and he sadly died from his injuries. Chy, who lived in Tuebrook but has since moved away, said: “Le has gone dull now. “He brightened up my day.  “The only thing that keeps me going now is watching every memory and looking at every picture I have of him. “That gives me strength to know that he is watching over me. “And I will carry him in my heart until the day I die.”  A police investigation was carried out following T-Jay’s death. It found that the window in the bedroom, where the children had been playing, was faulty and a restrictor - a safety catch to stop the window from fully opening- was broken. The tenant of the house had informed the landlord two weeks prior to the tragic incident, however a date was not arranged between the two parties for repair. The window has since been fixed. Chy, who works as a customer assistant, said her son was her “miracle” baby after being told she could not have children.  She said she clings on to the memories of her pregnancy and the day he was born.  She added: “He was my miracle. “I will never forget the feeling of carrying him and him moving around. “The first time I felt love was when I had him in my arms.  “His big blue eyes could light up a room. “If you were having a dull day he could always make you smile. “Every morning he would always give me a big cuddle.    “I remember one day, I don’t know why now, but he saw me crying and he just came up to me and cuddled me.” Chy said she is reminded everyday of her miracle son and has found solace in the support of her family, including her brother and dad, who were at the inquest yesterday.  She said: “My dad told me that T-Jay is looking down on me every minute of the day.  “He told me not to let what has happened to T-Jay be the downfall of me. “He said ‘ you are about to do something that you shouldn’t be doing think about T-Jay. “Oryou are doing something he would approve of - go and do it. “I know T-Jay is watching over me. “I find little feathers all the time andI see one I will pick it up. “There will be number plates on cars with T-Jay at the end and it will put a smile on my face. “He is always giving me these little signs.” Chy had not been told about the faulty window in the room in which her son was playing. However since the tragic accident, she is urging parents to “ask more questions” She said: “Don’t have anything in the way of a window so a child could climb up. “If something needs repairing, do it. “It took my son falling out of a window to have it fixed. “It could have been both of the children. “And then two families would be grieving now.  “It was just a normal day. “This could have happened to anyone. “No-one would go around a friend’s house checking windows or askingwindows are broken, but just ask more questions.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mums urgent operation relieve immense","story":"NewsMum, , is denied urgent surgery to end her constant pain - because she smokesMum-of-two Bethany Glass, , was told by doctors at the Spire Hospital in East Yorkshire that she needed to be smoke free for six months for the procedureShareCommentsByJoanna Lovell:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsBethany Glass has been told she cant have her gallbladder removed until she has been smoke-free for six months \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-two claims an aposurgentapos operation she was due to have in two weeks has been cancelled - because she smokes. Bethany Glass was due to have her gall bladder removed on July  after doctors discovered three large gallstones which have become infected and are causing her immense pain. The -year-old went for her pre-operation assessment on Wednesday at the Spire Hospital in Anlaby, East Yorkshire, reports Hull Live. There Miss Glass was told by NHS doctors they cannot perform the operation until she has been smoke-free for six months. East Riding clinical commissioning group will not operate on patients who smoke or are obese because they say they are at increased risk of suffering complications during or after their operation.    However, Miss Glass says her care in AE during the next six months while she tries to stop smoking will cost the NHS more money in the long-run. She said: If it was a smoking-related illness Iaposd get it because Iaposd caused it myself, but this is gallstones, this is not caused by smoking, itaposs unrelated and itaposs not like Iaposve caused it myself. Iaposm fuming about the whole situation. I was at my pre-op and they got me in the room and said aposIaposm sorry but we can’t do your operationapos and he said aposbecause youaposre a smoker, the East Riding no longer fund operations for smokers or overweight people. Iaposve been waiting  weeks now for this. It’s all swollen and bruised and infected. Itaposs at risk of the infection spreading to my pancreas which is why I need my gallbladder removing. They said they [my doctor] should never have referred me without telling me,they told me then Iaposd be a lot closer to the six months not smoking by now. But the doctor knew I smoked and the consultant even put it on the form - no one told me until the pre-op.    Everyone needs to know thatthey are ill, unless it’s killing you, you can’t have it done. Ms Glass, who has a six-year-old son and a four-month-old-daughter said during a flare up the pain takes her breath away and feels like sheaposs having like a heart attack. She says she does not think she can cope waiting another six months before she can even be referred again. She said: If I get a flare up again Iaposll I’ll end up in AE, away from my young children over something that could of been resolved in a day. It will cost the NHS more money than what it wouldthey just did the operation. All because they wonapost spend money on a smoker. I think it needs to become public knowledge as people need to be aware thatthey smoke or are overweight they not entitled to medical care, regardless to how fit they are for the operation, they wouldn’t be able to have it unless they pay private.  Ms Glass, who has smoked since she was , said she is willing to try to stop smoking - because she has no other choice. She said: I’m going to have to try to stop, but itaposs not that easy, especially when you have two children. I donapost know what  I can do. Iaposve even messaged my MP. This needs raising, itaposs discrimination, itaposs saying apos you smoke or you’re overweight we won’t help you.apos It’s wrong. Itaposs only the East Riding, its not UK wide.

One quarter even said their child’s school FORBIDS them from wearing sunglasses on school grounds. A spokesperson for monkey monkey sunglasses, which commissioned the study, said: “Parents are consistently telling us that their children are more likely to wear sunglasses on holiday or to leisure activities than at school. We just want parents to be aware that the midday and afternoon sun can be equally strong in the school playground, on the school sports field, or on the walk home from school, as it is on the beach.    Wearing hats and staying in the shade during these times help reduce UV exposure, but are not a substitute for wearing sunglasses with full UVA and UVB protection, because UV rays reflect through cloud cover and reflect off a iety of surfaces.” Researchers also found only  per cent of those polled said their children always wear sunglasses on a sunny day. And one in four said their child aged - doesn’t currently own a pair of sunglasses. Parents of children who rarely or never wear their shades in the sun said their kids find them uncomfortable to wear and so avoid themthey can.    However,  per cent who have bought their children sunglasses checked the specs for their UV protection rating before making the purchase. When asked about their knowledge surrounding surfaces which reflect and increase UV radiation,  per cent of parents who took part in the study, conducted by OnePoll, correctly said that snow reflected UV rays.

But they could be indicators of a food intolerance - and simply by cutting something out of your diet could improve your health and well-being. Experts have now come up with the six most common symptoms that show your body is reacting to a particular food you eat. Often confused with allergies, food intolerances are completely dferent. Symptoms can take up to  hours to present themselves and can y in severity from person to person.    Dr Gill Hart, Biochemist and Scientic Director at YorkTest Laboratories, said: “A food intolerance can occur when your body has trouble digesting certain foods. “When this happens over time, large protein particles from food can enter the blood stream. The immune system sometimes sees these particles as a threat and produces antibodies to ‘attack’ them. “Your body’s immune system responds by creating inflammation. It’s this inflammation which can trigger symptoms which,left untreated, can develop over time and may cause symptoms.” Here are six signs you may have a food intolerance.    . Tiredness or fatigue The most common cause of tiredness is lack of sleep but science has shown food and drink can have a big impact on your energy levels.Dr Hart said: “Many people associate food intolerances with digestive issues such as bloating and irritable bowel syndrome .“However, fatigue and low energy are also symptoms of a food intolerance. “In fact, one in five people who came to YorkTest for testing last year did so because they were experiencing tiredness.” . Itchy skin or eczemaFood intolerances can also contribute to skin related complaints, Dr Hart says. She added: “If you are experiencing prolonged bouts of itchy skin without an obvious cause, it could be a good idea to look at your diet. “People who tend to develop eczema are categorised as being ‘atopic’, which means they have an overactive immune system, causing their skin to easily become inflamed. “If there is something you are eating which is causing inflammation in the body, there is a possibility that this can impact your skin, meaning maintaining an eczema-friendly diet could be key in managing flare-ups.”  . IBS symptoms Symptoms of irritable bowel syndromeinclude abdominal pains, excess wind, bloating and constipation. IBS can be triggered by certain foods which irritate the digestive system and can also be a symptom of food intolerance. Dr Hart said: “Studies have found that irritable bowel is linked to a hypersensitive gut and many people find relief through eliminating certain foods from their diet.”  . Joint pain Do you have general aches and pains that can’t be explained by an underlying condition It might be wise to look at what you are eating. Dr Hart said: “If you experience general joint pain it might be worth considering what part your diet has to play because a food intolerance could be contributing to these problems.”According to the Arthritis Association, what you eat can cause inflammation in the body and joints, which can lead to pain.They say foods that can cause inflammation include sugar, saturated fats and trans fats, which is found in foods such as pizza and cheese.  . Anxiety If you constantly feel anxious it could be worth taking a look at what youaposre putting in your body. Dr Hart said: “Research has shown that gastrointestinal inflammation, one of the most frequent symptoms of food intolerance, is frequently found in those showing signs of depression and anxiety. “The relationship between the gut and mental health is often bi-directional.This means thatyou’re feeling depressed the health of your digestive system is likely to suffer, andyou’re having gastro troubles the chance of experiencing depression and anxiety increases. “Reactions to foods y a great deal from person to person and an ingredient which may cause problems for one person might be fine for another. “We call this our personal ‘food fingerprint’, and this is why food intolerances can be so dficult to pinpoint without help.”  . MigrainesMigraines are throbbing, intense headaches which can also be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light, noise or smell.The University of York conducted a survey to understand the benefits of elimination diets based on the results of a food intolerance test. Out of  people who reported experiencing migraines,  per cent reported an improvement having removed their ‘trigger’ foods.

The couple, with the help of Jessica, went on to re-slice and stack the cakes, before adding decorative frosting and worth of flowers.    Jessica uploaded a picture of the spectacular finished product online, before the post went viral - with thousands being left jaw-dropped at its beauty. Describing how the cake came about, Jessica said she came up with the idea after the bride and groom initially decided to cut costs by baking and freezing cupcakes for the wedding instead of a cake. She wrote: Y’all this DIY cake! It is no secret my bother is frugal...but this wedding took frugality to a whole new level. They bought two @costco cakes, cut them, stacked them, re-iced with buttercream icing, and covered with  @traderjoes flowers.  Boom a  DIY Cake! Displayed on the stand I built using stuff from@hobbylobby ...beautul on a budget! Jessicaaposs followers were quick to praise the family for the amazing DIY skills. One commenter said: I love that they got all of that stuff from those places! Another added: You should totally do a YouTube tutorial of this! This is hella smart.

Bryan, , and Ashley Bullerdick, , wed in  and started married le with two cats, Cinnabun, a rescue cat from the Humane Society, and Ginger, a Himalayan purchased from a breeder. Bryan said: They were very special to us. They started their le with us. The couple decided to duplicate Cinnabun but it sadly passed away in October before its clone arrived six months later.  Incredibly, the new Cinnabun sleeps in exactly the same spot that the original Cinnabun used to slumber, on top of Ashley’s pillow. The couple, from Charlotte, North Caroline, US, said they didnapost consider much of the staggering cost of cloning their aposspecial catapos. Bryan, who owns an aerospace ision business, said: This was a special cat from when we were newlyweds, our kids grew up with the cat, she was important. It is a lot of money but I know people who spend that on vacations all the time. This is an animal that we hope will be with us for two decades. It was a decision that we could afford to make and we still donate money to cat rescue organisation, the Humane Society, every month.  The couple considered cloning Cinnabun after Bryan read an article about pop legend Barbara Streisand cloning her Maltipoo, Sammie. I didnapost know it was possible until I read the article, said Bryan. He shared the idea with Ashley who was at first unsure. She said: “I was never against it but it was definitely something I had to think about.” In August  Bryan purchased a , DNA kit from Texas-based cloning company ViaGen Pets, the same company that had cloned Streisand’s pooch.  ViaGen Pets has been cloning horses and livestock for  years, three-and-a-half years ago they started cloning cats and dogs. Bryan and Ashley’s DNA kit languished in the freezer as they deliberated. “We kept it for months in our freezer while we thought about it,” Ashley said. “Then we just thought we had to do it. Cinnabun was so dear to us. She had unique markings that no other cat would have. “She clung to me, she slept with me at night, by my head on my pillow. She was right by my side throughout the day.” To clone a pet, ViaGen Pets requires at least two skin samples to collect the DNA.  Most skin samples are taken from the belly or the inside of a pet’s leg. These samples are then chilled with ice packs and sent to a laboratory where they are placed in an incubator and cells start to grow. Within two to four weeks, there are millions of cells. The cells are harvested and placed in vials which are frozen in liquid nitrogen tanks before it fuses together with an egg taken from a donor animal. The embryo then is implanted to a surrogate animal who gives birth to kittens genetically identical to the original cat.  As Bryan and Ashley sent in their cataposs samples in September, Cinnabun died on October . The clone was on February  and delivered to the couple weeks later in April. Ashley said: It was a special day of course. I was so excited to welcome her home. She was just two months old but she looked just like her. Even though we got the original Cinnabun when she was nine months old, just seeing the two-month-old Cinnabun overwhelmed me with joy. As far as looks go, they are spot on. Even their personalities are so similar. They are both feisty. The new Cinnabun wants to sleep in the exact same spot as the original Cinnabun - a place that none of my other cats have gone to. She likes to sleep by my head on my pillow and on a particular bar stool in the kitchen. Bryan added: We wanted to call the new cat Bun Bun but when we saw the pictures of her, she looked identical to Cinnabun when she was a kitten so we just kept the same name.

Marshae Jones, , from Birmingham, Alabama, was taken into custody this week over the  death. Jones did not fire the shots that killed her unborn girl. Police initially accused -year-old Ebony Jemison of manslaughter, but the allegation against her was thrown out by a grand jury that decided not to put her on trial. Instead, the would-be mother has now been charged with her unborn daughteraposs killing after she was accused of starting the fight that led to the shooting. Al reports Jones, who was five months pregnant, was rushed to hospital but the baby tragically died.Police Lieutenant Danny Reid said at the time of the shooting: “The investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby. “It was the mother of the child who initiated and continued the fight which resulted in the death of her own unborn baby.” Lt Reid said the fight stemmed over the unborn baby’s father and it was Jones who started the fight, which caused Jemison to defend herself and led to the death of the baby. Lt Reid said: Let’s not lose sight that the unborn baby is the victim here.    “She had no choice in being brought unnecessarily into a fight where she was relying on her mother for protection. Ms Jones is being held at Jefferson County Jail on a ,bond. The case has ided Alabama where activists are accusing conservative lawmakers of giving unborn babies more rights than the mums who carry them. Pro-choice activists view the prosecution of Ms Jones as the latest chilling test of strict laws affecting unborn children.    NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue tweeted yesterday: Today, Marshae Jones was indicted for homicide when someone shot her in the stomach while she was pregnant, ending her pregnancy. They said she aposstarted itapos. The shooter went free. This what  looks like for a pregnant woman of color without means in a red state. This is now. Alabama lawmakers earlier this year passed an amendment to the state constitution to recognise the apospersonhoodapos of a foetus. Alabama passed a bill in May that bans abortion even in cases of rape or incest - and would only be legalthe woman’s le is at “serious” risk.

The man, named only as Alexander, was found by hunting dogs roughly one month after he was overpowered by the predator in Russia’s remote Tuva region, it has been claimed. The emaciated man was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken spine from his fight with the brown bear, say reports. He told doctors a large predator had overpowered him.    “The bear preserved me as food for later,” he is reported to have said. The footage has not been independently veried by the Mirror. He drank his own urine to survive, he said. Medics say it is a “miracle” that he is alive. A group of Russian hunters claim to have found Alexander after their dogs barked and refused to move on from a bear den they passed in the forest in mountainous Tuva. The region is favoured by Vladimir Putin for vacations.    The hunters checked inside the lair and saw what they believed was a human mummy - until they released he was alive. “The man remembers his first name but not his age and was reportedly in the den for around one month - drinking urine to survive,” reported The Siberian Times. A hospital video shows the bearded man opening his blue eyes and confirming his first name. He was described as having “severe injuries and rotting tissue” from lying motionless for so long in the den. “Local medics say they cannot explain how the man survived such injuries,” said the report.  The exact location where he was found has not been revealed, nor the name of the hospital where he was treated. A spokesman at the health ministry in Tuva Republic, a region in southern Siberia, said: “We cannot confirm the case happened in Tuva. “It was not registered by the Ministry of Health, the Emergencies Ministry or any other official body . “Most probably, it happened somewhere outside Tuva.” The man was spoken to by medical staff in Russian rather than the local Tuvan language. Brown bears are known to hide their prey andto feast on it later.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening.

reputation during a successful three years at Livingston, winning League One and then promotion to the top ision before staying up convincingly last season.However, he’s swapped top-flight football at the Tony Macaroni Arena for another go at promotion from the Championship with Dundee.And he has no doubt he’ll be back plying his trade at the top table for the Dark Blues before long.He told the Tele: “Obviously you want to play at the highest level you can butthings go well here then it, hopefully, won’t be too long before we’re back in the Premiership.“Going for the title has to be the aim, I think.“A club the size of Dundee has to be pushing for the league.“It’s, obviously, going to take hard work, it’s not an easy ision, there are a lot of good teams and every point will be

grind out the wins, no one gives you anything for free, so it’ll be a tough challenge but one I am looking forward to.”Byrne revealed it was new manager James McPake who made the dference in deciding his future this summer with Premiership clubs interested in his services as well as Dundee.“I was on holiday and the gaffer text me, he had permission from Livingston to speak to me, so I spoke to him on the phone and then met him when I came back,” he added.“The way he went about it and showed how much he wanted me here and we got it done a few days later.“It all happened pretty quickly.“I could

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The lane floods, so between trying to dodge puddles, you land in dog dirt.I wish they would fix the path because a lot of people use it, some of them pensioners with or parents with prams.Celia MacFarlane, Lochgilphead.Sir,Seven out of ten people with diabetes feel overwhelmed by the demands of their condition and this signicantly affects their mental and physical health.That is why we are calling for new national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health support and to increase support available in Argyll to people living with diabetes.As part of Diabetes UK’s Diabetes Weekwe are urging people in Argyll to #SeeDiabetesDferently and back our campaign for national standards for diabetes mental health support and services.Our recently published research revealed the relentless nature of diabetes can impact people’s emotional well-being and mental health, ranging from day-to-day frustration and low mood, to specic psychological and mental health dficulties including clinical depression and anxiety.The findings, published in the report #Too often missing: Making emotional and psychological support routine in diabetes care#, show that diabetes is much more than a physical condition – and that emotional and psychological demands of living with diabetes should be recognised and support provided.Diabetes Scotland is urgently calling on the NHS to create national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health services. These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

You only have to look round this evening to see that.\"During the  years I lived here I was always overwhelmed by the welcome given to us, and the many opportunities to be involved in all aspects of town le.\"It has been the same in Raploch, even after only six months, anda place is defined by its community spirit, then both Peebles and The Raploch score very highly indeed.ldquoSo I hope you will permit me to say a huge thank you on behalf of myself and my family for the years we have lived here ndash to all I have worked with and met through church, Scouting, Beltane, schools, Tweed Theatre, running and many other ways, thank you, and Peebles will always have a very special place in my heart.Introducing this yearrsquos Warden of the Cross Kirk, Rev Hughes told the congregation of Father Lappinrsquos journey to becoming the Parish Priest at St Josephrsquos.He added: ldquoHis first calling was as a curate in West Lothian and then in  West Lothianrsquos loss became Peeblesrsquo gain.ldquoTony, I know from my friends at St Josephrsquos that you have made a big impact during your first year ndash indeed even before you came here a friend of mine in West Lothian messaged me and said lsquoPeebles is very lucky ndash you are getting Fr Tonyrsquo.\"Speaking to one of your parishioners last week I was told about how the parish feels re-invigorated and everyone is looking ahead with joy.After officially being installed, Father Lappin delivered his address and chose two readings from the New Testament, the first being Luke :-, when Jesus speaks the parable of the Good Samaritan and what it means to be a good neighbour.He said: ldquoDuring Beltane Week, Peebles celebrates being a community, and one of the important aspects of a good and healthy community is our commitment to be good neighbours to one another.\"We are called to do for others, especially those who need a helping hand, what the Good Samaritan did in this reading.The second reading was from the First Letter to the Corinthians.Father Lappin explained: ldquoThis tells us that the Holy Spirit gives us many gts in order that we might share these gts for common good.\"We are told that the Kingdom of God is like a body made up of many parts, with each part needing the other parts so that the body canproperly.ldquoAgain, an important aspect of a good and healthy community is recognition by all its members as to their inidual skills and talents, and then a commitment to share these skills and talents freely in order that the whole community may benefit.\"Peebles is full of people with wonderful things to offer.A selection of children from the local primary schools and unormed organisations spoke about how they contribute to their community.Father Lappin closed with an important message to Peebleans: ldquoAs we go into this great week of community celebration, let us be mindful of what it means to be a good neighbour to others, especially to those who need our help.\"And, to be mindful of our own skills, talents and gts, so that we can share these for the building up of the community and the common good.The rain stayed firmly in the clouds for this majestic outdoor ceremony and that is just where this community wants it to stay until their Queen is crowned tomorrow ."},{"url":null,"title":"trial-told-how-peebles-health-worker-followed-girls-to-watch-them-urinate","story":"THE trial of a health worker from Peebles has heard how he followed young girls to watch them urinate.And one described how he touched her inappropriately.NHS dietician Peregrine Burgess is facing a total of  charges involving  alleged victims -

road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised. In many areas the level of nursery provision simply isnrsquot there and independent nurseries are already struggling financially with the planned

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

The Tories: for failing to deliver Brexit and for wasting three years. Labour: for being hopelessly ided over Brexit and for having a leader whos turned equivocation into a fine art. EvenLabour does a back-flip, and supports a Peoples Vote, it may be too late.

Nicola Sturgeon would surely demand a referendum on independence for Scotland as a precondition for entering any confidence and supply coalition with Labour. ldquoConfidence and supply means that they back Corbyn as Prime Minister, but dont agree to support all his policies. This would be a horrendous situation for the Labour leader.His party is already deeply ided over a possible referendum on Brexit. It would now also be ided over the Union.

But there is no way, after Nick Cleggs disastrous  coalition with the Cameron Conservativesthat the next leaderwould go down that road. But she is almost as hostile to Scottish independence as to Brexit. Its a double headache for Corbyn.Perhaps a leader of political genius, a Harold Wilson perhaps, would be able to keep the non-Tory ducks in a row, but it seems most unlikely that Jeremy Corbyn would have the personality or the negotiating skills, to cope.

It is a moment for reflection. Heaven knows there is plenty to distract us where. Sofagate, photogate, everything-but-the- blooming-garden-gate: these are times of feast for those who like their politics served up as bread and circuses. But let us turn for five minutes from the clash of cymbals and egos at Westminster and consider where we are,  years on from that July day. To borrow a phrase from Monty Pythonrsquos Le of Brian, what has the Scottish Parliament ever done for us : Top official to stand downOne dference between Scotland then and now is that there is a new television channel on which such questions can be asked. On Tuesday BBC Scotland showed the first of a two part documentary, Children of the Devolution, in which reporter Allan Little toured the country posing the Brian question, albeit in his own elegant way. How strange it was to look back on footage of that day and hear Donald Dewarrsquos ldquoA moment anchored in history speech again, an address that Nicola Sturgeon said was one of the finest in modern Scottish politics. With its quiet sense of pride, its grasp of history and hope for the future, it is a speech that more than passes the test of time. ldquoThis is about more than our politics and our laws, Dewar said. ldquoThis is about who we are, how we carry ourselves. Still sounds great.Dewarrsquos speech was almost too good, for it set up expectations that were always going to be impossible to meet. After the soaring rhetoric came the crash to Earth. Remember the great medal stushie  The poisonous Section  debate  And all the while, minute by minute, the cost of the new Parliament building climbed and its completion was delayed. Initially expected to cost poundm-poundm, the final bill was poundm. Even now, that still has the power to shock.As Little looked at how policy had progressed in areas such as land reform and LGBT rights, there was a sense of jobs being half finished and plenty left untouched. Tackling the obscenity of child poverty, closing the attainment gap, ensuring waiting times for NHS treatment are met, improving transport: anyone looking for things to be fixed in Scotland today would be left with a list as long as the Royal Mile.: Diversity concerns over parliamentWe shall leave that there a moment to ponder something  that arose from Children of the Devolution, apart from the question of what the heck happened to half the male populationrsquos hair .More to the point, when and why did the standard of MSPs and debates fall  How did we get from a time of Dewar and Salmond and Wallace, of passionate debate on issues of real substance, to todayrsquos poorly attended parliament in which little of real import happens outwith Budget day  This week, for example, the news from Holyrood was that no Education Bill ushering in radical change would be introduced because, in the opinion of the Minister, John Swinney, it was no longer needed. Really  So the entire exercise turned out to be just a way of filling time  Distributing colouring-in books to MSPs would have been a lot cheaper. The parliament, moreover, goes into recess from next Monday, ing on September . A nine-week holiday. Now that is a very nice way of marking the th anniversary.: Tories out of touch says SturgeonIt is understandable for Scots today, just as it was  years ago, to look at the Scottish Parliament and wish for something more. As Dewar acknowledged, a Scottish Parliament was not an end but a means to greater ends. One of the most telling moments in Children of the Devolution came when Little went back to his old school in Stranraer to ask pupils for their views on the Scottish Parliament. First reaction seemed to be that they were underwhelmed. But then they thought some more, listing a few of the things that had changed their lives for the better, such as voting at  , and what  they wanted to see done, chief among which was closing the attainment gap.As for the future, most saw themselves leaving the local area. It was the same in Littlersquos day, which he seemed to find disheartening. After all,the Scottish Parliament was about anything it was making Scotland as a whole a better place to live and work. But young people will always want to move where it is part of growing up. What I saw when I looked at the pupils in Stranraer was a generation more comfortable in their skin than I ever was. There is a pride in young Scots that goes deeper than  minutes it is in the bones, and much of that feeling is due to the Scottish Parliament being there.Dewar looked forward to the time when July , , would be seen as a turning point, the day when democracy was renewed in Scotland, when we revitalised our place in this, ldquoour United Kingdom. Whether you agree with those sentiments or not, look at what is happening in Westminster and think how much more dispiriting events would be without the knowledge that Scotland has a parliament of its own, ready and waiting to do more. So yes, let us see that July day  years ago as an occasion worth toasting.As we now know, there are worse things than dreaming big."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-marion-fellows-asks-theresa-may-to-crack-down-on-parents-who-dodge-child-maintenance","story":"SNP MP Marion Fellows raised the issue at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, as figures showed arrears under the CMS scheme rose by pound. million in a  months.While the agency is meant to ensure parents take responsibility for their children, Ms Fellows said its bark was worse than its bite.Calling for a crackdown on the enforcement of payments, she said \"children are living in poverty because of a lack of maintenance payments.\"The latest DWP figures show CMS arrears rose from pound million to pound. million between December  and March  ndash an increase of pound. million.Between the same months, pound. million was owed under CMSrsquos Collect and Pay servicendash where CMS monitor and pursue collections ndash but only pound. million was paid.A third of all cases assessed under Collect and Pay have paid nothing while the remaining % can only be guaranteed to have ldquopaid some maintenance.While the UK Government introduced new measures to put pressure on deadbeat parents, such as confiscating passports, in December, the DWP predicts that only  passports will be confiscated in the first year.Meanwhile the UK Government wrote off pound. billion of historic CSA arrears last year, and is seeking to wipe out an additional pound. billion instead of moving thee arrears to the new CMS.Responding, Theresa May said the government wanted to ensure parents \"normally, it is fathers, but sometimes it is mothers\", take their responsibilities seriously.

With the government at Westminster wanting to see the amount of recycled municipal waste rising to at least % by , Topham believes radical action is needed.ldquoScotland has been more proactive in this and England is catching up, he says, pointing to the example of the Scottish Government planning depositmachines to encourage people to recycle plastic bottles.ldquoIt has also introduced an obligation for food waste to be separately collected from households and from business.ldquoAt Bfa, we are now advocating this approach across the UK and the Environment Secretary Michael Gove has included it as one of the main pillars in his own strategy. Topham questions whether enforcement and compliance may be an issue with this policy and adds that there needs to be a financial incentive to encourage good practice.ldquoNevertheless, itrsquos been the right thing to do and I also think itrsquos an area where having devolution is positive, as you get an opportunity to see what works and to copy one another.He also cites Scotlandrsquos proposal to ban biodegradable waste from landfill, though he says there has been some concern that the construction of the required energy-to-waste infrastructure to support this may lag behind the policy, meaning the refuse still has to be exported to England.ldquoIt shows that when it comes to the big picture, everything has to be joined up.Another area where Scotland is leading the way is with its planned depositscheme, which will collect . billion bottles and cans for recycling every year.Consumers will pay a p deposit when they buy these, getting the money back when they are ed. This will reduce carbon emissions by about , tonnes per year.ldquoI think the intent and vision of the Scottish Government is laudable, though it would make sense to put themachines in areas of high footfall such as shopping centres where a lot of people consume drinks on the go, he notes.Topham is something of an evangelist for positive change and for looking at inventive ways of stimulating re-use of materials, saying better organisation of this is of fundamental importance to society.ldquoWe need a system that is environmentally ambitious, easy to use and cost effective.Hersquos also an advocate of a proposed plastic tax on products that use less than % of recycled material in their production, announced in last yearrsquos UK budget.ldquoWersquore not talking about this coming in yet ndash it wonrsquot happen until after about  ndash but just the very prospect of it is starting to change behaviours. Manufacturers donrsquot want to have to pay a penny of that tax when it comes, so they want to be ready.Bfa is making other recommendations to improve recycling, including clarity on labelling, perhaps in the form of a simple-to-understand traffic light system similar to that used for food nutrition that include simplying sorting methods and collection frequency for households not being over-prescriptive for business and recognising there is no one-size-fits-all solution and keeping food waste separate, using it for recycling and regeneration of energy.In another move, the company is looking at its own existing fleet of diesel powered vehicles and exploring the potential for using electrically powered ones instead. It is currently conducting a commercial trial of these in Manchester ndash the first waste company to do so.ldquoIrsquod like to bring on the day when these can be used ndash it would be fabulous, not only for climate change, but also for local pollution, Sadly, wersquore just not there yet with the technology, says Topham.ldquoAt the moment, itrsquos really only feasible for urban, city centre locations where yoursquore travelling quite short distances. But the feedback wersquove had from our Manchester project has been great and we would like the manufacturers to make more for us.ldquoThe big operators must not be laggards ndash we have to force the agenda and make things happen. But at the same time, we must remember that our customers, whether theyrsquore local authorities or businesses, still want value for money. Itrsquos got to work financially as well as environmentally."},{"url":null,"title":"muirfield-golf-club-invites-females-to-become-members-for-first-time","story":"The worlds oldest golfcourse inEast Lothian, which was founded in , has invited women to join the club as members for the first time since voting to change the clubrsquos rules in .Twelve women and three men have been invited to take up membership.It comes after the course was removed as a host of the Open Championship in  by golfs governing body over its stance on women members.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer.

No job, no housing and no money can create a sense of hopelessness that spirals into reoffending.In fact, the current rate of a prison leaver being reconvicted in Scotland after  months is more than one in four.That’s why the UK Government and I want to do something about it.Today I am visiting Scotland’s only all-female prison, HMP Cornton Vale, to explain some changes we’re trialling to the way we support offenders in Scotland as they prepare to leave prison.The women I will meet today are not just statistics, but people who have so much to give to society and to the economy. They’re a Mother, a sister, a partner, a friend, a worker and we need to make the most of their talents.So I want the transition from le in prison to le back in work to be as seamless as possible.: Prisons ‘bursting at seams’ as inmate numbers pass ,: Universal Credit has created ‘emotional distress’ for people with mental health conditionsFor starters, prisoners close to release at HMP Cornton Vale and HMP Perth are set to receive enhanced employment support while in prison in a bid to reduce re-offending rates in Scotland.This means DWP prison work coaches in Scotland will help prisoners get their CVs written, interview preparation done and job hunting underway so they are better able to get a job and hit the ground running when they are released.We know that those who engage with a work coach while in prison get a Universal Credit payment three times faster so the earlier we get people speaking to Jobcentre staff and getting themselves ready for work, the better.As part of the pilot, we’re going to make it possible for offenders to begin their benefit claim in advance, so once a prisoner is released they can be able to access a payment at the Jobcentre Plus on the day of their release.I’m aware that signing someone up to receive benefits won’t solve all their problems. But having some financial reassurance amongst an overwhelming amount of uncertainty will go a long way to landing people safely back into society so they can make a full contribution to everyday le.And it’s not just financial security. We know housing and employment are absolutely crucial to avoid repeat offending. That’s why our work coaches, alongside prison staff, will also be able to identy accommodation for offenders being released and talk about working options.This pilot builds on our existing support for people leaving prison, including encouraging employers to recognise the benefits of employing from this pool of talent. We often see that in their search for stability, people who have left prison tend to stay in a job for longer and have lower rates of absenteeism.As well as highlighting the benefits for business, we have developed advice for employers on recruiting those with criminal records and we champion those organisations offering work opportunities to people coming out the gates by sharing testimonials from businesses who have already hired ex-offenders.The trials we’re doing are all possible because of the flexible support offered by Universal Credit.Universal Credit was introduced to create welfare system that provides genuine safety net for those in need, but also a springboard to help people realise their potential.Over two million people are now successfully receiving the benefit, more than , of those in Scotland. People are moving into work faster and staying in work for longer than under the old system, and by the time it is fully rolled out we project that around , more people across the UK will be in work.Finding work is the best route towards prosperity and we want people to leave prison with a real opportunity to start again.Which is why I am so pleased we are making these changes to provide money and support for ex-offenders in Scotland – so that finishing a prison sentence can truly be the start of a new le.This is all part of the advantages that Scotland enjoys as a result of being in the Union. And the man I am backing to be the next Prime Minister, Jeremy Hunt, will ensure the precious Union will never be broken.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s citizens assembly should not be a stunt leader comment","story":"Scottish Government may need to do more to convince sceptical opposition parties to take part in the Citizens# Assembly of Scotland.It is a simple idea. Bring together  or so honest citizens – free from ambition for high political office and the sinister machinations of party politics – set them to work on the greatest issues of our time and then sit back to wait for a solution so simple, wise and beautul that everyone wishes they had thought of it.Citizens’ assemblies have attracted a host of fans across the political spectrum from former Conservative leadership contender Rory Stewart to French President Emmanuel Macron and a majority of people in Ireland who backed proposals on legalising abortion and gay marriage after one was held on those issues.: Pro-Union parties brand Citizens’ Assembly a ‘Nationalist stunt’: Scottish independence: SNP can bypass election watchdog on referendum questionSo it’s perhaps not a surprise the Scottish Government is setting up a Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland in which  members of the public will be asked “what kind of country” Scotland should be and how it should “overcome challenges” like Brexit. It’s also not so surprising that the Conservative and Liberal Democrats have decided not to take part with Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins describing it as a “Nationalist stunt”, adding wearily that “we’ve heard it all before”. After the isive nature of the  independence referendum, having a citizens’ assembly on Scotland’s constitution future could be a means of healing wounds, helping both sides to see each other’s point of view and to recognise that they are both entitled to it.It could also help flesh out alternatives to independence like ‘home rule’ or ideas around creating a federal system of government in the UK, as recently suggested by Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser. It could also be a chance for unionists to lay out a positive vision of Scotland in the UK and for independence supporters to do the same about Scotland as a separate state.If it is to be an “SNP stunt”, its impact will be much reduced and questions will grow about the use of taxpayers’ money in this way. Indeed, it could turn out to be a political problem for the SNP. Certainly,they cannot be persuaded to take part, unionist parties are likely to try to make it one.Appointing former Labour MEP David Martin was clearly an attempt to give the assembly cross-party credentials but,that attempt is to succeed, the Scottish Government may need to go the extra mile to bring on board those who are understandably sceptical about the process.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"muirfield golf club admits women members for the first time in 275 years","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which has its home at Muirfield, in East Lothian, has invited women to join the club as members for the first time since voting to change the clubrsquos rules in .Twelve women, along with three men, have been invited to take up membership from July  after taking part in the clubrsquos traditional process.: Woman in critical condition after being found with signicant burns in Bathgate car fireThe club has hit the headlines many times for its controversial approach to female membership.In , the golfs ruling body, the RA, removed Muirfield as a host venue for the Open Championship as a result.

Supported by a -piece orchestra, the impressive score will feature all the big numbers including I Still Believe, The Movie in my Mind and the iconic The American Dream.-year-old Aquinas pupil Lára Mulgrew will perform the role of Ellen in the stage show. No stranger to the Grand Opera House stage, Lára performed aged nine the role of Molly in their production of Annie. Lára described the audition process “as very straight forward” and how it will be “wonderful” to portray the role of Ellen come July.“I hadn’t seen the production before but was able to watch it on Youtube. It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"how divine mercy is local turning lives around","story":"FOUNDED in , the Divine Mercy group continues to go from strength to strength.Four years on, the group attracts weekly attendances of up to  people every Friday afternoon at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street.The worship group helps those suffering with suicidalthoughts and addictions, using faith as a form of help.Thomas Stewart, who helped set up the group, explained more about the work the group does.“I set up the group with a friend, who  years ago lost his brother who took his own le through suicide,” he said.“It was a total shock to his family and he felt he needed to do something to help others with similar problems.“We started the Divine Mercy group up in  and it was just three of us. It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le. Ask for help and reach out to the Divine Mercy.”The Divine Mercy group meets every Friday at pm at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street and all are welcome to come along."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"squeeze on school places gets worse","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw says a fundamental reform in the allocation of school places is needed, after figures showed a soaring demand for places in South Belfast,with well over a quarter of applicants now not getting their first choice.Ms Bradshaw revealed statistics released to her by the Education Authority outlining the number over the past five years of school admissions.In ,  pupils living in South Belfast applied for a post-primary place –  pupils were offered a place at first preference whilst  were refused.In , out of a total of  applications,  pupils were offered a place at first preference, with  refused.“The number of pupils seeking places in South Belfast post-primary schools has risen from  to  in the past five years, yet Area Planning seems to have managed to miss this completely,” explained Ms Bradshaw.“This defeats the whole purpose of Area Planning. How can it not already have been known that approximately  more pupils would be requiring places over this period  If Area Planning was unable to monitor this correctly, it is entirely unsuited for purpose. It is a complete failure of the system. “The outcome of this failure is drastic. As a consequence, we now have, for the first time, seven pupils in South Belfast not receiving any offer at all for September . Additionally, the number not receiving their first choice rising dramatically from  per cent to  per cent and this will only rise further.“With more than a fth more pupils seeking places in South Belfast than was the case just three years ago, we should have been taking action to address the shortfall in provision we knew was pending.“The increased intake at Lagan and Aquinas, of  places each, can cover only a sixth of that increase and is nothing like sufficient. So, what we are seeing is a comprehensive failure of the whole transfer system in South Belfast.“With ever more new housing in and around South Belfast, this is only going to get worse in years to come. Where is the monitoring of this  What will the requirement be five years from now  What is being done to address it  “The Alliance Party has called, and will continue to call, for a fundamental, independently-led review of education provision with a view to far-reaching transformation recommend-ations being proposed.“A high priority within this process would be a focus on improving Area Planning, so that pupils and their families are not left in the appalling situation where they are left without a school, with the ultimate solution being more educational provision either within existing schools or a new build,” added Ms Bradshaw."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives finally revealed in report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be.

The continued foreign escapades of the Member of Parliament for North Antrim do nothing to enhance the reputation of the area,\" he said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs Foster must be prepared to take speedy action against the MP. He said: \"Ian Paisleys Males jetsetting has already disgraced his office and earned him a record suspension from Westminster.\"These new revelations further degrade his reputation and they degrade trust in politics.\"Ian Paisley should come forward now and clary the circumstances of these holidays, who paid for them and on what basis. If he does not, then it is for Arlene Foster to take action and to do so quickly.\"TUV leader Jim Allister also called on the DUP to act.\"Whatever Ian Paisleys attitude to transparency, surely his party cannot ignore this further Spotlight expose,\" he said.\"Even by Ian Paisleys standards, the latest BBC Spotlight revelations are shocking. Hardworking people in North Antrim, who pay their own way in le, are unlikely to be impressed.\"My wider concern is the further damage done to Unionism plc. Such self-inflicted injury is not what we need or expect from a unionist MP.\"Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan said: \"The DUP announced in December that it was investigating the first wave of Males allegations but we have heard nothing since then about what actions have been taken to discipline their shamed MP. Another tearful mea culpa apology from Ian Paisley just isnt going to be enough.\"These allegations are gravely serious and they need to be treated as such by the authorities and Ian Paisleys own party.\"Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said: \"If this behaviour is true, and he is found to be guilty of it, Mr Paisley will have once again let down not only his constituents but also himself.\"If we are to regain the trust of the wider public in politics, there must be full openness and transparency from everyone.\" Mrs Foster yesterday said she had so far been unable to watch the Spotlight programme, but that its claims would be investigated by party officers.\"As you know, Ian was suspended for  days last year by the party,\" she said.\"He is now back in the party under sanction and those sanctions still exist. But we will look at that and deal with those serious issues that have been raised by the Spotlight programme.\"In a statement the DUP said: \"We note the serious issues raised in the programme. The party officers will consider these matters within the context of our disciplinary process and any other relevant authority.\"Ian Paisley MP was suspended from the party for  days.\"He was readmitted to membership, with conditions. Amongst other sanctions, was a ban on holding office in the party for  months. That ban is still in place.\"We require high standards from our elected representatives.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt backtracks after saying veterans and provos should be treated the same","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

We made three or four goal chances, we scored one and we missed a number of kickable scores and frees, Tally said.ldquoThe players, though, gave all they had and never gave up on it. Ultimately, against a team like Mayo,you are not clinical you will come up that bit short.Over in Fr Lynch Park in Ballyholland, Down camogs won a hard-hitting encounter with a talented Laois side.Down held a - to - interval lead and then withstood a concerted second half fightback from their visitors, but the Ulster champions did enough to get over the line in a robust and competitive clash.Down now entertain Carlow on July  or ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Special event marking 10th anniversary of new Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospital is  years old.A special event to mark the occasion takes place at the main foyer at the Struell Road facility this Friday at pm, with the birthday celebration attended by past and present staff.Ahead of the event, South Down MLA Colin McGrath has paid tribute to all the staff who work at the hospital and the excellent service they provide.He also described the hospitalrsquos past decade as a ldquorollercoaster which featured many highs and many lows.ldquoThe one constant has been the high quality of care offered at the Downe from a range of health care practitioners and the all-important support and wrap-round staff, said Mr McGrath.But the Assemblyman said he and many others are keen to see theof the hospitalrsquos -hour AE service and dedicated coronary care unit.He said people also have concerns about the loss of the Downersquos coffee shop, praising the the GP out-of-hours service which he believes is a model which could be successfully replicated in other areas.ldquoThis is an exemplary unit and everyone who uses it is happy, he continued. ldquoAdditional regional clinics, including ophthalmology, are now delivered in Downpatrick which has helped generate increased footfall.

It is vital that trips such as this are declared so that the public can have confidence in elected representatives. Yet republicans have clearly been flouting the rules for years.”He added: “Now is the time not just to look at the undeclared trips but, with the renewal of the DUP’s confidence and supply arrangement with the Tories on the horizon, all unionists should unite in calling for the allowances for MPs who don’t turn up to do the job to be stopped.”Sinn Fein said: “Sinn Fein MPs often undertake international visits to promote the Irish peace process and to share the Irish experiences of conflict resolution and peace building ... “These visits are routinely publicised and never involve personal gain or advantage. We recently consulted with the Westminster Registrar and are happy to register all international travel.”try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Video clips from The World at War TV series were screened to remind all of the intensity and magnitude of the period leading up to, during and after D-Day.Overall, the performance lasted almost three hours but for those gathered the time did not seem to matter.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
