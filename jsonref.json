A novella, it is set after the end of the trilogy His Dark Materials, but before the start of Pullman’s recent book, The Secret Commonwealth. The story sees Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon “older and a little wiser, and in search of an answer to a shocking, secret condition – their ability to separate – from the witch-consul, Dr Lanselius”, revealed the publisher, Penguin Random House Children’s.Pullman wrote the story for a charity auction in 2004, at the request of Nicholas Hytner, then director at the National Theatre, during the company’s production of His Dark Materials. The manuscript was acquired for a “substantial sum” at the time, with all proceeds going to charity.“Why are we publishing this story now?” said Pullman. “Because with the development of The Book of Dust, especially after the events described in The Secret Commonwealth, we can see a change in the way Lyra understands herself, and her relationship with Pantalaimon, which is prefigured in this little Arctic episode.“When I wrote Serpentine, I had no idea that I was going on to write another trilogy, showing Lyra as an adult, but she and her world wouldn’t leave me alone. When it comes to human affairs, a billion invisible filaments connect us to our own pasts, as well as to the most remote things we can imagine and I hope that, above all, these books are about being alive and being human.”The story, said its publisher, is “tender”, “revelatory” and “foreshadows Lyra’s future struggles as a young woman”. The actor Olivia Colman will narrate the audiobook edition, and artist Tom Duxbury will illustrate the book.His Dark Materials, comprising Northern Lights – first published 25 years ago this year - The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, has sold 17.5m copies worldwide and been translated into 40 languages, winning prizes including the Carnegie medal, the  children’s book award, and the Whitbread book of the year. A BBCHBO television adaptation aired last autumn, with season two, based on The Subtle Knife, out later this year.Ending as Lyra crossed the boundary from childhood to adulthood in The Amber Spyglass, Pullman followed His Dark Materials trilogy 17 years later with the first in The Book of Dust trilogy, La Belle Sauvage, in which Lyra appears as a baby. The second novel in the second trilogy, The Secret Commonwealth, jumped forward to follow Lyra as an adult and was published last year. The details of the third and final book have yet to be revealed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40bdc1d6a765f88f98c316c3e7e50ca5c29fc50a/504_317_4956_2973/master/4956.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=14c40f2b810ea33e97bb2eefa27dde8e","title":"energy watchdog unveils 25bn uk green investment drive","story":"Ofgem to upgrade infrastructure and cut household bills by £20 a year by restricting idendsHousehold energy bills will drop by £20 per year after the UK energy watchdog unveiled a £25bn green investment plan meant to improve Britain’s energy infrastructure.Ofgem said the five-year investment programme will cover repair and maintenance costs for existing gas and electricity networks and support the growth of green energy. The regulator said it would also aim to keep costs low for consumers, by cutting the amount of money usually pocketed by utilities and their shareholders.The watchdog said it would also cut more than £8bn from company spending plans by setting more ambitious efficiency targets and blocking costs that it said firms have not justified as delivering value for consumers. “It is now up to the companies to come back and provide more robust evidence on why this expenditure is needed,” Ofgem said.The package is meant to save £3.3bn in company expenditure from being passed on to customers between 2021 and 2026. Energy bills are expected to drop by £20 per household per year in 2021, though the long-term reduction in bills could drop to £10 depending on how much is spent on additional green energy projects over the next five years.Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said: “We are striking a fair deal for consumers, cutting returns to the network companies to an unprecedented low level while making room for around £25bn of investment needed to drive a clean, green and resilient recovery.“Now more than ever, we need to make sure that every pound on consumers’ bills goes further. Less of your money will go towards company shareholders, and more into improving the network to power the economy and to fight climate change.”Around £3bn of the £25bn in upfront funding will be used to connect green electricity sources and upgrade the transmission grid, to make sure the network can cope with rising levels of renewable energy as part of the energy mix.Ofgem said it could also make another £10bn available for emissions free energy and and infrastructure upgrades that aim to reduce carbon emissions and bring the UK closer to net zero carbon targets. That is on top of a £630m fund meant to drive research and development into “crucial” green energy projects.“Ofgem will scrutinise every investment and only give the green light to measures that deliver decarbonisation at the lowest cost to consumers,” the regulator said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccfd745970fe683ce74f5773497aefe2de1255b0/0_91_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a594401d8bbdabe6502c5dcff0389b7d","title":"german exports covid 19 economy us jobless business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Germany’s trade gap widensBack in the UK, jet engine maker Rolls-Royce has lifted the lid on the cost of the Covid-19 crisis, and warned that a full recovery could take several years.Rolls-Royce told the City it has burned through £3bn of cash in the first half of 2020. That’s partly due to a fall in new engine deliveries and less need to service engines in service (as many planes were grounded).Rolls-Royce also warned that the “medium-term market outlook for the commercial aviation industry” has deteriorated., meaning revenues won’t recover quickly. Due to the deterioration in the medium-term outlook caused by COVID-19, absent mitigating actions, we forecast a shortfall of US$ denominated cash receipts over the next seven years compared to our hedged position It’s already taking action, cutting 9,000 jobs across the group (3,000 UK staff have applied for voluntary redundancy already, with 2,000 expected to leave by the end of August).The latest inflation figures from China also suggest the world economy is in recovery mode.But other European markets are less buoyant, with UK stocks falling a little:European stock markets are off to a decent start on Thursday, following a couple of days of declines as indices continue to linger close to recent highs.There’s no doubt that the bounceback has stalled but, encouragingly, we’re not yet in reverse despite the growing concerns about Covid second waves. Naturally, the sheer amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus and the promise of more if needed, is giving investors reason to stay strong, despite the economic outlook being far from as promising as what the markets would suggest.German software maker SAP has also reported a pick-up in demand.SAP told investors last night that business activity gradually improved in the second quarter of 2020, with revenues and operating profit edging up from their Q1 slump.Europe’s biggest tech company struck an upbeat tone (under the circumstance)“Software licenses revenue, while still below normal levels, recovered more than expected.SAP is also sticking to its full-year guidance, although it all depends how the pandemic plays out...The outlook continues to be based on the assumption of a gradually improving demand environment in the third and fourth quarter as economies reopen further and population lockdowns ease.Looking ahead, while April was the worst month ever in terms of most economic data releases, the month of May has been one of the best months ever. However, it will need a couple of these ‘best month evers’ to bring the economy back to its pre-crisis level. Particularily the ergence between domestic and external demand is remarkable. While retail sales surged with the lifting of the lockdown measures, the much more muted improvement of industrial production and exports illustrates that the former growth engines of the German economy will continue to stutter for a while.Brzeski has also spotted those regional differences:The different degrees of lockdowns across eurozone countries are also reflected in German export data, with exports to France, Italy and Spain dropping more significantly in April than to most other trade partners. Interestingly, the share of exports to China increased to the highest level ever. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management says Germany’s factories are leading the recovery:German trade data showed exports and imports growing. Services have been hit more than manufacturing by the virus, so trade should outperform the economy for now. Here’s Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics:Today’s trade figures also show that German companies only sold half as much to British counterparts as usual in May, compared with a year earlier.Sales from the UK to Germany also fell year-on-year, but not as sharply.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.As Europe’s powerhouse economy, Germany will play a huge role in leading the region out of its coronavirus slump. And today we can see that exports have picked up sharply as the lockdown eased - although there’s still a long way still to go.Destatis points out that Germany’s trade position is much weaker than before the crisis began:The figures also show that trade with the US and UK was particularly weak in May, while exports to China held up better -- as the Chinese lockdown ended earlier, of course (more on that shortly..).European stock markets are expected to open higher, after China’s equities rallied to another five-year high, their eighth day of gains.The latest unemployment figures from America are likely to show that more than a million people filed new welfare claims last week, extending a grim run which began in March. This ‘initial claims’ figure is expected to dip from 1.42m to 1.37m, still alarmingly high, as some states reimposed lockdown restrictions as Covid-19 cases rose.Euzone finance ministers are meeting today, to select their next leader. Spanish economy minister Nadia Calvino, Irish finance minister Pascal Donohoe and Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg are all in the running to chair the eurogroup.The vote comes at a crucial time, as European leaders struggle to agree the details of a massive recovery fund.

He did it again on Wednesday while unveiling his plan for jobs. “We entered this crisis unencumbered by dogma,” the chancellor told fellow MPs. “And we continue in this spirit, driven always by the simple desire to do what is right.” Fine words uttered in a sympathetic tone. The trouble is, they are not matched by actions. The former investment banker, who can see that the UK is entering a historic economic and social crisis, is grappling with the ambitious politician who doesn’t want to scare Conservative backbenchers. What emerges from this unhappy struggle is the strange alloy offered on Wednesday: sound analysis, sensible priorities but underwhelming, sometimes even wrongheaded policies.Finally, the Treasury is right to focus on preserving and creating jobs. Over the past few weeks, independent economists had speculated that up to 5 million Britons could be out of work by next year even now, it looks quite likely that unemployment could top 3 million within months – a level not seen since Margaret Thatcher was in No 10. Between coronavirus and the turmoil of Brexit, we are almost certainly lurching into a jobs crisis.Yet even as Britons head into a hurricane, Mr Sunak hands round cocktail umbrellas. Possibly his single biggest mistake was to announce that the furlough scheme will come to a sudden end in October – the “cliff edge” that the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and many others begged him to avoid. In its stead will come a retention bonus of £1,000 for each furloughed worker employed until January. This looks less like job creation and more like a handout for companies. Treasury officials have a hidebound prejudice against explicitly supporting particular industries, but it would have made sense for the furlough scheme to be extended for those working in hospitality, culture and other sectors where social distancing makes business as usual a distant dream.It would also have been smart to consider subsidising employees to work fewer hours, as Germany does with its Kurzarbeit programme. The most notable absence of all was anything for the self-employed, for whom it took the government weeks of pressure in spring to devise help. Mr Sunak’s defenders will say that he can always make more announcements, just as he brought out three consecutive budgets in March. But businesses and households need to make plans, and soon. They will already be making investment and spending decisions: keep that office or not? Buy that equipment or pause? Send my child to university or wait and see?The priorities chosen by Mr Sunak are also odd. A few weeks ago, the government dragged its heels over providing meals this summer to hungry children. It took a fervent campaign, an angry press and a Premier League footballer to get Boris Johnson to U-turn and spend the £120m. On Wednesday afternoon, the chancellor committed over four times that sum to giving every family a half-price meal next month. He threw £4bn at the housing market, but offered nothing to renters. The government, which on Sunday evening clapped for carers, showed them an empty hand.This crisis has exposed a bust economic model and a broken social contract. On Wednesday the chancellor showed no interest in changing either, in seriously greening industry or making jobs better. His chief objective was in getting back to business as usual as quickly as possible. Given what lies ahead, he is unlikely even to achieve that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89a46b86d3ad9accc4d3efa83e2a4bc5c4f0b83e/106_0_4608_2764/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c34d9fe72e14f36bc2f24833d8c7ac","title":"us colleges international students ice deportation","story":"New Ice rules will force schools to either reopen, risking Covid-19 exposure, or effectively kick out foreign studentsIf you are an international student planning to study in the United States this fall and your classes are online, you might want to prepare yourself.

But climate scientists also agree that, in addition, massive amounts of CO2 need to be removed from the air to meet the Paris agreement goals of keeping global temperature rise below 2C.The rock dust approach, called enhanced rock weathering (ERW), has several advantages, the researchers say. First, many farmers already add limestone dust to soils to reduce acidification, and adding other rock dust improves fertility and crop yields, meaning application could be routine and desirable.Basalt is the best rock for capturing CO2, and many mines already produce dust as a byproduct, so stockpiles already exist. The researchers also found that the world’s biggest polluters, China, the US and India, have the greatest potential for ERW, as they have large areas of cropland and relatively warm weather, which speeds up the chemical reactions.The analysis, published in the journal Nature, estimates that treating about half of farmland could capture 2bn tonnes of CO2 each year, equivalent to the combined emissions of Germany and Japan. The cost depends on local labour rates and varies from $80 per tonne in India to $160 in the US, and is in line with the $100-150 carbon price forecast by the World Bank for 2050, the date by which emissions must reach net zero to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.“CO2 drawdown strategies that can scale up and are compatible with existing land uses are urgently required to combat climate change, alongside deep emissions cuts,” said Prof David Beerling, of the University of Sheffield, a lead author of the study. “ERW is a straightforward, practical approach.”Hansen, who famously warned the US Senate about global warming in 1988, said improving soil could also underpin food security for billions of people.Other proposed ways of pulling CO2 from the atmosphere at similar rates include using chemical solvents to capture it directly from the air, or growing energy crops, burning them to produce electricity and then burying the CO2 emissions. The new research suggests ERW will be less expensive than either and, unlike energy crops, does not compete with food for land. But the scientists said all approaches may be needed to beat the climate crisis.Planting trees and adding charcoal to soil also remove CO2 from the air, and these approaches could potentially be used in combination with ERW to maximise the impact. “Planting trees is an excellent option for CO2 removal but is not sufficient on its own,” said the scientists.Basalt is preferred for ERW as it contains the calcium and magnesium needed to capture CO2, as well as silica and nutrients such as potassium and iron, which are often deficient in intensively farmed soils.Basalt is one of the most common rocks on Earth, and waste dust from mining could be used for ERW, as could waste from cement and steel manufacturing. This would remove the need to grind the rocks into fine particles, which requires energy. But how big these waste stockpiles are is unknown.Beerling said ERW did not require new technology, and farmers could get behind it, adding: “If you could demonstrate to farmers in China and India, for example, that they are going to get crop yield increases and get paid $100 a tonne for removing CO2, then it becomes really attractive.”Prof Johannes Lehmann, of Cornell University, and Angela Possinger, of Virginia Tech, both in the US, who were not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary on the work in Nature: “Any carbon sequestration involving soils is a formidable challenge because the technologies must be used on vast areas of land that are operated by hundreds of millions of farmers. Farmers must be fully behind such a global effort or it will fail.”They added: “Benefits to crop growth will need to be prioritised, as will financial incentives.” But they concluded that using ERW to “support soil health and crop production could emerge as our best near-term solution to the problem of removing CO2 from the atmosphere”.Beerling said that while the model used for the analysis was sophisticated, it would be important to compare its estimates with real-world experiments under way on 4ha plots in the UK, US, Australia and Malaysian Borneo, and that more research was needed on the detailed soil chemistry. “It is quite a young science,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be286c8c7c64955b5e22d4b143c81dc0c489caa/108_0_3284_1971/master/3284.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ba9a76ac60fa7fff62ec072a5de1723a","title":"entire rare bird colony vanishes baffling new zealand scientists","story":"Experts believe endangered shore plovers – known for their pluck and friendliness – might have flown away or been eaten by predatorsA specialist search and recovery team has been deployed to recapture the last remaining survivors of a flock of endangered birds that absconded from a predator-free island in New Zealand during coronavirus lockdown.There are only 250 shore plover or tūturuatu left in the wild and they are the world’s rarest plover. Conservationists have been painstakingly reintroducing them to the mainland after they were almost wiped out by cats and rats by 1880.The birds survived for another 100 years in a remote colony on the Chatham Islands, 650km west of New Zealand.Shore plovers are endemic to New Zealand and renowned for their “attitude and friendliness” – traits which alongside their ground nests make them highly vulnerable to predators.Mana Island off the coast of the North Island’s Kapiti coast was a successful home to an introduced colony of plovers in 2007. But a few short years after being introduced a single rat wiped out half the population, with the rest dying shortly later due to “complications”.After the 2007 devastation conservationists avoided reintroducing the plover until the pest situation was resolved.But in April and May they again took the plunge, transporting 29 young birds to the island, some of whom required ministerial approval to travel during the Covid-19 lockdown.The birds were colour-banded but not tracked, the department of conservation (DoC) said, and it now appears nearly the entire population has again vanished: either having being killed by avian predators such as rūrū, or having flown off to the mainland.Shore plover recovery group leader Dave Houston from DoC said the birds’ mysterious disappearance was “frustrating”, as substantial time and money had gone into their recovery.Houston said his team were unsure what exactly had happened to 26 of the birds, though it had tracked three survivors to Plimmerton beach on the mainland, with a search and recovery team hoping to recapture them later this week. Reports from the public have been helping DoC keep tabs on the survivors.“The birds haven’t stayed at home like we hoped they would,” Houston said.“We honestly don’t know what is making them leave but it could be that a single bird decided to fly to the mainland and everyone else followed them – it could be random behaviour, we’re not sure.”In past releases shore plovers had been found to fly as far south as Christchurch in the South Island, and despite their small size they showed considerable pluck, Houston said.“It is frustrating, we can give them strict instructions, but they choose not to obey. They are a challenging species to manage, so it’s a great loss to then lose them. But we persist.”If the three survivors are captured they will be returned to Mana Island and held in an aviary for a month rather the usual week to help them establish “fidelity” to the island, Houston said.Radio transmitters would also be attached to the birds so conservationists “can determine their fate … We might not find them at all though,” Houston mused. “They’re not very long-range transmitters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d1dbccfe03ecb632cd957ff3bea6123aeea284a/106_289_2217_1330/master/2217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e51b5a0920d6250119a839e8e64ade4","title":"chanels lagerfeld inspired haute couture shows how luxury can thrive online","story":"Virginie Viard’s strong designs in chic colours shine, despite digital showcase’s subdued vibePre-pandemic, Chanel’s show would be a highlight of any Paris couture schedule – with a set worthy of a movie. Highlights from previous years have included a replica Eiffel Tower, an abandoned theatre and, last season, a library with books lining the walls.By contrast, the brand’s contribution to the first digital couture fashion week was a little lower-key. Debuted on Tuesday morning on its website was a one-minute-22-second film with models Rianne van Rompaey and Adut Akech wearing 30 outfits from the house’s most elite collection.The coronavirus crisis has forced fashion labels to move from physical events to online showcases, as the industry navigates the new normal. This video was showcasing creative director Virginie Viard’s designs to the couture customers who might be tuning in. It contrasted with other brands’ take on going digital, such as Schiaparelli’s film of designer Daniel Roseberry sketching his collection or Christian Dior’s narrative of mythical creatures being coaxed into couture dresses. While the latter film was let down by its lack of ersity in casting, it was probably the most imaginative take on digital couture this week.The Chanel collection was inspired by the life of the late Karl Lagerfeld, with whom Viard worked for over 30 years at Chanel, before becoming creative director after his death in 2019. In a press release, Viard wrote that she was thinking of “punk princesses”. “Karl would go to ‘Le Palace’,” wrote Viard. “He would accompany these very sophisticated and very dressed-up women, who were very eccentric too.”If the presentation perhaps lacked the wow factor of the physical shows, the clothes were strong and looked like the serious luxury that the couture client is looking for. Tweed pieces utilised yarn by Vimar, the high-end thread company that Chanel acquired this month. Jewel-like pinks and greens mixed with silver and inky blue – a colour palette that felt chic but also very wearable, should one have the required budget. A series of tiered gowns in taffeta and velvet, and beaded and embroidered pieces, were particularly sumptuous and ready for black-tie events, whenever they might return to social diaries.This is the second video Chanel has released since the pandemic. The first, for the “cruise collection”, was released on 8 June. The seven minutes of models standing in front of imagined seascapes and on elegant balconies was criticised as not reading the room while the news cycle focused on the emerging protests around George Floyd’s death and cities emerging from lockdown. It was also seen as a bit of an anticlimax after the razzmatazz of Chanel’s physical shows.Acclaimed art director Fabien Baron, speaking to WWD about the cruise show and fashion film, said a “straight” approach is less engaging. “Let’s remember that film is about image and storytelling, otherwise it can be very flat and an easy medium to lose an audience,” he said.Asked about the issue of ersity in fashion, Pavlovsky said it was a priority across Chanel’s business, which was reflected in the ersity of staff in its boutiques across the world. He said this was important for reaching a erse and international customer base. “Our customers are from everywhere – all cultures, all skin colours … As a brand, I believe we need to continue to be very engaged,” he said. “The best team is a erse team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0af09dde4650f4b137fd424c44b84eb7f35247d/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b55605b884b85a23c3bc1ae80ab716","title":"black water abyss review croc reptilian survival horror","story":"It’s hard to muster more than a frisson of fear in this reptilian survival encounter set around a caving tripAbyss? Abysmal is closer to the mark. This survival horror from Australia – pitting man against killer croc – swims in the shallow end of scares. It creates the merest ripples of fear, despite contriving a nightmarish escape-proof predicament for its victims: four friends on a caving trip who become trapped on the banks of an underground lake as it fills with water, a croc the size of a minibus snapping at their feet.We meet the friends – two couples in their early 30s – as they pack, director Andrew Traucki conspicuously paying attention to details that will be significant later. While gung-ho Eric (Luke Mitchell) charges up the head torches, his girlfriend Jen (Jessica McNamee) scrolls through his phone, suspicious that he’s been distracted. Their friends Viktor (Benjamin Hoetjes) and Yolanda (Amali Golden) arrive waving Viktor’s asthma inhaler and they set off. Traucki builds some intensity as the four lower themselves into the cave along with a guide. Claustrophobics will probably experience a prickle of terror here that non-sufferers will be denied by this otherwise unscary movie.When the croc attacks, the gore feels a bit PG. Could it be that crocodiles can’t compete with sharks in the predator stakes? Maybe its grin is too cheesy? Or perhaps Jaws has instilled in us all a baseline fear of sharks? But a couple of immersive scenes might reel you in. In one, Yolanda has to throw the inhaler a few metres across the lake to Viktor on the opposite bank. She hesitates, and in that moment I put myself in her shoes. (Would I fluff the throw? Almost certainly.) The movie becomes less interesting when Jen makes a discovery about Eric that leads to a relationship showdown with the croc looking on with embarrassment. Maybe it, too, is perplexed about how her mascara has stayed put. This is paddling-pool-level entertainment.• Black Water: Abyss is released in cinemas on 10 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d76fff9fc320fa5aaeebd93174f61bacd0693c2/440_90_1170_702/master/1170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c071b8b65a48a9a9dae8be5b30da19dd","title":"david athertons recipe for kronans kaka","story":"This ‘kronans kaka’ is made with potato for a gluten-free sweet treatPotatoes are a great way of adding structure and moisture to a cake.

The arrangement, which will be administered through cleaning agency OCS, also provides back pay for cleaners who were sick or self-isolating after 1 April.The announcement follows  reports in June that the MoJ failed to investigate a potential Covid-19 cluster among its cleaners. The cleaners’ union, United Voices of the World (UWV), warned in April that workers felt forced to continue working despite feeling unwell because they could not afford to losewould have lost money. Those who took time off only received statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week.In May, the  reported that Emanuel Gomes, a worker on the MoJ cleaning team, fell ill and died hours after his shift. There is no evidence Gomes had Covid-19 and a postmortem gave hypertensive heart disease as the probable cause of death.Gomes’s family and United Voices of the World say that he continued working because he did not feel able to call in sick. On the day he died, a colleague said he was so feverish and unwell “he didn’t know where he was”’.“Emanuel went to work feeling sick – but he knew that if he didn’t work … he would get to the end of the month and wouldn’t have enough money,” his brother Leao told the .The MoJ strongly denies cases of Covid-19 were connected to its offices, saying: “It’s simply untrue to suggest there has been an outbreak linked to our headquarters.”In April, testing was not widely available for people who were not hospitalised with coronavirus. OCS told the  that it was not obliged to report Covid-19 cases at the time and had followed public health guidelines and asked iniduals with symptoms to self-isolate.Announcing the new scheme, an MoJ spokesperson told the : “We are extremely grateful to all the staff that have ensured our buildings remain safe for those who cannot work from home.“We hope the fact that OCS colleagues are now able to self-isolate on full pay will provide financial reassurance.”United Voices of the World had been campaigning for full sick pay well before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Molly de Dios Fisher, one of the union’s organisers, said in response: “We wish to stress how deeply angry and saddened we are that this decision has come too late to save Emanuel Gomes. Had this sick pay policy been implemented sooner Emanuel might still be with us today.“We are proud to have finally forced the MoJ to pay full sick pay.

She watched with mounting dread as message after message poured in. First there was the garment worker who had been sacked for demanding personal protective equipment for his colleagues. Then pregnant women and union members started calling for help, saying they were also losing their jobs.As Bangladesh’s garment sector reels from the economic impact of Covid-19 and the shock of  £2.4bn of cancelled or suspended orders inflicted on the industry by overseas fashion brands, a wave of job losses has swept across the country. Moreover, during lockdown hundreds of thousands of workers were not paid for work they had already done.While the Bangladeshi government has rolled out a major bailout package to keep the industry afloat, experts warn that 1.8 million workers are likely to permanently lose their jobs. Already, activists say manufacturers are using Covid-19 as an excuse to weaken unions and purge “undesirable” workers.Since they began tracking cases four weeks ago, Akter’s organisation and others have received reports of the termination of dozens of pregnant workers from more than 30 factories – a number she expects to “increase dramatically in the coming weeks, as workers continue to be fired every day”.One of the sacked workers, Mitu, was three months pregnant when her production manager fired her in late June. Mitu, who asked that we use only her first name, had taken 19 days of authorised medical leave after she became dizzy at work, nearly fainting. When she returned, she overheard the management discussing not wanting to pay maternity benefits. Then they fired her, citing missed work.“My family was depending on my income, and my maternity benefits,” she said. “We have had to take out loans to survive, but soon that will run out.”Another, Morzina, was five months pregnant in May when her manager told her and three other pregnant workers to stay home “for their safety”. When they reported back to work in June, they were told they no longer had jobs. Morzina, who had been working at the factory for eight years, also did not receive the retrenchment benefits – equivalent to nine months full pay – to which she was legally entitled.Since May, she has filed 50 lawsuits on behalf of sacked pregnant workers. In some of these cases, companies had taken workers’ identification cards and forced them to resign, while others simply refused to pay women their maternity benefits.Nazma Akter believes there are many more cases, but with industry-wide job losses, many pregnant workers are too frightened to come forward.“So many women are not getting maternity benefits – the factories are just telling them to leave, and giving them a few days pay,” she said. “Usually we would fight these but with the pandemic, women are afraid. They don’t want to lose their jobs.”Because of the move to remote working, many brands have also stopped carrying out social audits and factory inspections, which has led to an increase in workplace violations, according to Nazma Akter.“Without the monitoring, the factories can do what they want,” she said. “We are seeing a real increase in gender-based violence.”Union organisers are also being targeted, according to Babul Akhter, the president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, who reports anti-trade union activities in a third of the factories where his group operates.“Before, when factories engaged in union busting, we could go directly to the brands and they would help,” said Akhter. “But now that the brands are cancelling orders and fighting with the suppliers, we are on our own.”Mark Sebastian Anner, a professor of labour and employment relations at Penn State University and an expert on the Bangladeshi garment industry, warns that the combination of massive job losses and the purging of union activists could lead to worsening conditions for employees, including forced labour.“This is a profound international crisis that has disproportionately affected the people at the bottom of the supply chain, to the extent that their very survival is at stake,” said Anner. “We’ll be seeing the repercussions for years to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b230465560135235b7af182f7a00a525bd75a916/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150e829355fb869e908e9bcfa3f4ea4b","title":"fix of the trade how google helped a handyman build his business online","story":"Wielding the right digital tools has enabled Will Lingard to thrive, even during lockdownAs with most self-employed tradespeople, word of mouth plays a significant role in Will Lingard’s job as a handyman in and around Wonersh, a pretty village of red-tile cottages and timber-beamed houses a few miles south of Guildford. Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473ddf12486a48df79edc79336b9da1ddb50475/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64d254b4a65ad0ee81b15a92a6965c","title":"we realised we were a necessity how a high street baker used google to keep serving his community","story":"For Sam Mensah of London bakery Uncle John’s, the right digital ingredients equipped his business to rise to the challenge during lockdownThe bright yellow signage of Uncle John’s Bakery stands out like a beacon on West Green Road, in the north London suburb of Tottenham. Famed for its lovingly made Ghanaian sweet bread and other regional specialties such as drop doughnuts and meat pies, the bakery has served London’s African-Caribbean and wider community for 25 years.Sam Mensah took over the family business in 2015. “When my parents came to Britain in 1982, they had nothing behind them education-wise, but they were ready to seize the opportunities life in the UK could provide,” he recounts.“They longed for the comfort of Ghanaian sweet bread, but the available imports were stale on arrival. So they started baking their own, to a family recipe, using somebody else’s bakery after midnight. Soon they started selling it by word of mouth. Then they had it packaged, placing it in Ghanaian shops. Eventually they built up enough momentum to open a shop of their own.“It wasn’t always easy, but whenever things looked bleak, my mum reminded my dad of a Ghanaian motto: obeyeyie – things will get better. I think – and especially now, when people might feel like they need to give up on things – you have to have resilience.”Resilience and persistence is clearly baked into the family DNA, as Mensah too proved when he set aside a successful music career to take over running Uncle John’s from his ageing parents. Tackling a steep learning curve, he not only added two new production units and gained the certifications needed to be able to supply supermarkets, but also comprehensively rebranded the store and built up a digital and social media presence.And as the UK went into lockdown in March, it was this spirit of resilience that made all the difference. Mensah says he did have a moment of panic: “We closed the store for a couple of days. Then we realised the wholesale side was moving fast and that we were a necessity – that people will buy our bread. So we reopened, putting measures in place to protect our staff, and publicised our new opening times on social channels, and above all, on Google My Business.”Using Google My Business – a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including updating opening times on Search and Maps - meant customers could not only see the bakery’s new hours of business, but also that online ordering was available, either for pickup, or for delivery within an eight-mile radius. Uncle John’s also delivered flour – a hot commodity at the peak of the lockdown.If luck is when preparedness and opportunity meet, Mensah had the perfect package at just the right time: an optimised website with Google Maps integration, a strong social media presence, and an informative Google My Business profile. Positive Google reviews further buttressed his credibility, reassuring first-time customers. With all the pieces coming together, what could have been a crisis became a springboard for further growth.Mensah is clear what a lifeline it has proved to be: “With Google My Business, we have been able to communicate our business’ adaptations during this current pandemic, and helped bridge the gap between our business and consumers by keeping customers informed. And in turn, through reviews, we are able to understand what the customer wants and adjust accordingly.”And the effects go well beyond his premises Mensah was also able to publicise his NHS initiative – priority service and free loaves for NHS staff. “Serving our community at this time is more important than ever,” he says. “We’ve given out more than 2,000 loaves so far.”In fact, this community ethos was what drove Mensah to take over the family business in the first place: “What really helped me make that decision was having a daughter of my own. I wanted her to see what legacy is about. I felt that this business was something very important within the community, and for the generation that comes after me.”For Mensah, the way forward is now clearer than ever. “Our goal is to stand our ground among all British companies, not just black businesses,” he says. “And it’s no longer just for us. It’s for all the people who are placing their trust in us.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a371e11d8c0194b16ba2ad85052f592fafd61558/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e65dd308a467c45f3bb10e9faf011db","title":"we sold the most books ever in a month how an inclusive bookseller adapted during lockdown","story":"Lynsey Pollard’s family-run business champions ersity in children’s books. Using Google tools helped Little Box of Books become a bestsellerLynsey Pollard picks up her phone from the kitchen table and pans the camera around to reveal dozens of boxes stacked through the living room behind her. “There’s another bookcase full downstairs and some in the hallway,” she says. “You should have seen it two months ago you could barely move. We even had to store them under the bed.”It’s been a hectic three months for the director of Little Box of Books, a subscription service for children’s books she runs with her partner Neil Langston from their London flat. In mid-March, just before the coronavirus lockdown, they took the risk of ordering a three-month supply of books instead of the normal one-month’s supply.“We had no idea how business would go, how our suppliers would manage or if they’d even exist afterwards,” Pollard says. “We wondered what would happen if one of us got sick. Neil also runs an IT consultancy and we’ve got an 18-month-old and a six-year-old to look after. For a two-person business, it was quite intimidating.”Pollard credits Google tools for the surge. “Google My Business has helped us to help our customers,” she explains. “We could let them know we were still open for business and fully stocked up. It is amazing to have a versatile and visible storefront apart from the website that drives traffic to our products, helping people to find us and trust us.”For Pollard and Langston, who founded the company in 2018 with the aim of bringing greater ersity to kids’ bookshelves at home and in school, this enhanced ability to create awareness of their product and capitalise on it is central to not just their business, but to their mission.Pollard, who previously worked in charity communications, had the idea during a period as a single mum to her eldest son. “I just didn’t see our family in any of the stories I was reading to him.” Now, each month, after scouring scores of publishing lists, she sends customers hand-wrapped books and other learning resources that include characters with different racial backgrounds, disabilities, step-parents, single parents, two mums, two dads and anything else that more accurately reflects the society we live in.Pollard and Langston hadn’t even finished testing their website, but she soon found herself on Sky News discussing the study and her new business. To make the most of the media exposure at the time, Pollard started using Google ads so her website would appear when people searched for more erse books. “It helped bring us our first customers who weren’t friends or family,” says Pollard. “That was such a great feeling, to know that people wanted to buy our product.”“We thought books and learning resources that would transport them outside of their family bubble during this time could be important,” says Pollard. “So we created ads to reference that, and help more people to find us.”Pollard says Google tools have enabled their business to reach an entirely new audience in recent months. “They have brought hundreds of people to us who may not have realised that most children’s books don’t accurately reflect the world we live in today. I love that it’s why we set up the company. I’ll continue to update my Google My Business as another place where people can find our business.”There’s a social element to all that Pollard and Langston do. For every box purchased, they send one to London-based child literacy charity Doorstep Library. And since March, each new order has received a stamped envelope addressed to a care home resident, so children can write letters or draw pictures for older people who are isolated.When we speak, anti-racism protests have spread from the US to the UK, further highlighting the need for greater ersity on children’s bookshelves. Pollard is already noticing the impact on her business. “People want to do better for their kids. Sometimes they just need a little help. We’d love it if all children could see themselves in stories. Then instead of talking about ‘erse books’, we could just talk about ‘books’.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed003cc6f1125e654114e03df8ec27cb0550c947/0_14_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15c80c18f1e2b80cfca7edc06931274c","title":"how to stop your glasses steaming up and 19 other essential facts about face masks","story":"How often should you wash a cloth mask?

In Wales masks are recommended, though not obligatory, on public transport.A mask, says Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, is a “means of reducing the propensity of someone who has got Covid-19 to spread it to others. We’re not talking about protecting yourself by wearing one, but about reducing the risk to other people.” Wearing a mask is just one measure, along with handwashing and social distancing, to try to contain Covid-19, and seems particularly useful for stopping people who have unwittingly contracted the virus, but who are not showing symptoms, from spreading (if you do have symptoms, you should be self-isolating, not going out wearing a mask). “What you’re doing,” McKee says, “is catching all the little droplets that are coming out of your mouth before they can get into the atmosphere, when they can dry out and become very small and float around as an aerosol. There is still stuff that is going to get out, but you are reducing that risk.”With so many of us still coming to terms with this “new normal”, we asked McKee and other experts to answer some common questions.“Indoors,” says McKee. “The risk of transmitting the virus outside is low. The risk is indoors, in crowded situations, where the air is not being filtered out, and particularly where people are speaking loudly, shouting or singing.” People should wear them at the supermarket and while out shopping, says Maitreyi Shivkumar, a virologist and lecturer in molecular biology at De Montfort University, and anywhere you’re “likely to come into closer contact with people you can’t really get away from”. Do you need to wear one while exercising outdoors? McKee says not, but Shivkumar says possibly. “I’ve seen pictures of lots of people running alongside the Thames in London, and in that scenario I would suggest you wear one. Outdoors, if you’re staying away from people, it’s fine, but in large crowds you should wear one.”The one that may provide maximum protection for the wearer, says Shivkumar, is a FFP3 respirator (a disposable shaped mask with a valve that filters air) “but we know that the production of them is more difficult and healthcare workers are not getting access to them, so it is important to reserve those for frontline workers who come into contact with Covid-19 patients”. And anyway, masks with valves – found on dust masks and antipollution cycling masks, for instance – are not thought to be effective at stopping the spread of Covid-19. A study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh into different mask types found that the valves improved breathability for the wearer, but would not stop infectious matter being breathed out. “For the public, cloth masks are fine,” says Shivkumar. “There’s not a lot of data on the efficacy of cloth masks but they’re better than nothing.”Jeremy Howard, a data scientist and cofounder of the campaigning organisation Masks4All, says you should really only wear one once. “They’re not designed to be worn more than once or cleaned,” he says.“They’re not a great choice to use at all,” he adds. “Disposable masks are generally surgical masks: they’re designed to protect from all the stuff that might be coming out of the surgeon’s face during surgery. They have to do so many things that they’re not perfect at any of them. A cloth mask, on the other hand, can have a better fit and more absorbent materials, and can be reused as many times as you like. It really is a better approach.”Some disposable masks come with an expiry date. If you’re planning to wear one for everyday use, is this something to worry about? “Do you want the official answer?” says McKee with a laugh. “I’d have to say yes.” But in reality, he goes on to say, as long as you’re using the mask to nip to the chemists on the bus, rather than caring for Covid-19 patients in hospital, “the risk of using ones past their expiry date, providing they actually look physically all right, is probably fine for this sort of circumstance”.You can buy lots of ready-made cloth masks now, but there are also tutorials online showing you how to make your own. “Nearly any kind of face-covering is effective at blocking droplets coming out of your mouth,” says Howard. “Shortly after they come out of your mouth, they evaporate and become much harder to block, which means it is more difficult for masks to block droplets coming into your mouth.” There isn’t good evidence that wearing a mask will prevent you from getting (as opposed to spreading) Covid-19.Any kind of tightly woven fabric is a good choice, says Shivkumar. “The more tightly woven, the better.” Howard recommends using cotton of 600-thread-count (if you can find this out – it’s the number of threads an inch). “Things such as high-quality bedsheets, for example. Generally, a better-quality cotton is going to have a higher thread count.” The WHO advises a combination of fabrics, with an inner layer of absorbent fabric (to contain the droplets) and a more waterproof outer layer, such as polyester.No, although, says Howard, “it’s better than nothing”. The fabric may be too thin or, if it’s a chunkier scarf, it can be difficult to get several comfortable layers out of it. “There was some data suggesting that bandanas and scarves are not very good because the fabric has a lot of holes in it,” says Shivkumar.The WHO advises a minimum of three, although four layers can be up to seven times more effective than a single bit of fabric. The problem, says Howard, is “you don’t want to go overboard because it reduces breathability”. He suggests two layers of cloth with a filter inserted between them this should be of a different material, such as a piece of paper towel or silk (Shivkumar has heard of people using coffee filters). “I use a piece of paper towel – I’ve got a little pocket for it in my mask,” says Howard. “When I come home after going out, I dispose of that, and put in a new one.”According to the University of Edinburgh study, masks need to have a tight fit to be really effective, though this needs to be balanced with wearability (a looser mask is better than no mask). It needs to be fairly snug to block droplets coming out of your mouth, and even though it has not been proven that a cloth mask (rather than personal protective equipment) protects the wearer from Covid-19, this may change. There is “some evidence that masks might directly benefit the wearer”, according to Paul Edelstein, emeritus professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the authors of a new report for the Royal Society.There are three places to check for fit, says Howard. The first is around your nose. “It’s a good idea to use something with a mouldable nosepiece. If your mask doesn’t have one, you can get a paperclip, a pipe cleaner or even just a piece of aluminium foil that you can roll up, attach to the top of your mask and mould to your face.” It should be snug around your chin, and fit well over your cheeks. “This is where cloth masks can be quite a lot better than surgical masks,” says Howard. “You can get or make a cloth mask that goes further, closer to your ears, and then tie it up around the back of your head. Surgical masks tend not to be as wide.”“Before you put the mask on, wash your hands,” says Shivkumar. “Only touch the straps try to avoid touching the mask area.” Howard is a bit more relaxed: “Surface transmission through cloth is pretty much unheard of for Covid-19. Officially, the medical advice is to take it off from the straps rather than the front, and you may as well do that because it’s easier.”Even if the chance of picking up an infection from your mask is low, you’ll want to keep it as clean as possible – wearing a dirty face-covering isn’t going to be particularly pleasant. “Put it in maybe a Ziploc bag that keeps it away from everything else – that’s what I tend to do,” says Shivkumar. “It’s going to be fine if you put it in your bag and it’s wrapped in a scarf or something.”Howard thinks that, for most of us, one mask a day should be sufficient. “If you’re doing extremely hot work and getting super-sweaty, you should probably change it if it gets very wet,” he says.It also depends on the material – a thin mask, or scarf, will become damp quickly. “Once it becomes damp, it’s not going to be as effective,” says Shivkumar. “But I’m hoping people are going to continue to be sensible and not spend hours together in a situation where they would have to wear masks.” McKee questions whether a damp mask is going to be less effective, but he adds it can cause other problems, such as skin irritation. “You wouldn’t want to be wearing a damp mask.”Treat your face mask “the same way as you treat your socks or underpants”, says Howard – as long as you’re the sort of person who only gets one wear out of their pants before washing. “It’s good to have a spare mask so you can have one being washed and wear the other one the next day.”Howard says you can – as long as the masks have been washed thoroughly.“In our house, we present wearing a mask as something that’s fun and exciting,” says Howard. “We let our daughter pick out which colour she wants.” Explain to your child why masks are a good idea. “We talked about how coronavirus is a disease that can make people sick, and we could even make her grandmother sick if we weren’t wearing a mask.” Make sure you have a mask that is child-sized and as comfortable as possible, “and particularly think about breathability”. In England, the government has said that children under the age of three should not wear a mask, but it is under five for those in Scotland. In England, children under the age of 11 are exempt from mandatory masks in Northern Ireland, it will be children under 13. As with adults, children with breathing difficulties, disabilities or who are unable to put on or take a mask off unassisted are exempt.If you are sitting indoors, should you wear a mask to order from the waiter and then take it off to eat? “I can’t see how this would work,” says Shivkumar. “The thing to remember with masks is: it’s not everything – it is important along with washing your hands, not touching your face and social distancing. It’s part of the bigger picture.”“If it’s a well-aired house, it’s maybe not necessary, but I would say generally if you’re indoors, stay 2 metres away and wear a mask, and that will reduce the risk,” says Shivkumar. “It’s about recognising the risks and working towards reducing them.” It depends on the situation, says McKee. “This is a continuum – trying to reduce it to a yes or no is problematic. If you’re going to be close to them, if you’re going to be there for a long period of time and it’s a very confined space, then you’re moving towards a point where you may think about wearing a mask. If you’re not going to be close to them, or if it’s a large room, then you’re towards the end of not needing to wear one.”As well as younger children (see above), there are exemptions for some people with health conditions or disabilities and people who assist them. For example, if you are travelling with someone who relies on lip-reading, you are not required to wear a mask. “There may be people for whom it may be very difficult,” says McKee. Asthma UK advises people with asthma to try a few different face coverings to see if they can find one that works for them. “We need to think about people who lip-read,” says McKee. “There are transparent masks that may help, but we have to recognise it is going to be a problem. And it may be an issue for people with learning disabilities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff02d590a99ec550c9a855e442e3b1b2477a7dd2/0_215_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=652e3ea770674453653c8e44d9e9fcf9","title":"stamp duty chancellor rishi sunak summer statement","story":"Rishi Sunak has announced a stamp duty holiday in his summer statement. How will this affect you?The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced there will be no stamp duty to pay on property purchases up to £500,000.Stamp duty land tax, its proper name, is a tax paid by someone who purchases a property or piece of land in England or Northern Ireland – Scotland and Wales have their own systems. The tax is paid when the sale is completed and is based on the sum paid.Prior to the financial statement, there were two different points at which stamp duty was payable, depending on whether you were a first-time buyer or a mover. For movers, stamp duty had to be paid on any property costing more than £125,000.For first-time buyers there was no stamp duty to pay unless a property cost more than £300,000. If your first home cost more than £500,000 you paid the same as a mover but if it cost less than that, you only paid tax on the part of the price that fell between £300,000 and £500,000.The cut will make a difference for anyone buying a property over the old thresholds. For first-time buyers, it will generally be those in the south-east and London who stand to benefit, as elsewhere they would typically not be spending more than £300,000.The saving could allow people to move more quickly than planned – instead of needing the money for tax they can now channel it towards their deposit. The tax is paid after a sale is completed, so anyone who is part-way through buying a property will benefit.At £250,000, a first-time buyer was already off the hook for stamp duty but a mover would pay £2,500. They will now pay nothing.An investor spending £250,000 on a property will save £2,500, while one spending £495,000 will save £14,750.The housing market was frozen during lockdown, with buyers and sellers told to stall purchases. Since estate agents reopened there are signs that people are looking again – property websites and mortgage lenders have all reported jumps in interest from prospective buyers but the Treasury is obviously worried that the rebound will be fleeting.While some people are not moving because of immediate financial problems that will be solved by the cut, there will be many others who are staying put because they have lost their jobs, or are concerned about the outlook for the industry they work in. The cut may bring forward purchases but it may not stimulate many extra ones.Previous holidays have focused on first-time buyers and do not seem to have led to a surge in sales. The chancellor mentioned that prices had fallen since the crisis and talked about taking away uncertainty for people, so the move seems designed to support values. Some of the money saved by buyers could go towards their offer for a property and lead to increases in parts of the country where the market is busy. The fact that landlords and investors will also get a tax cut will make this more likely than if it had only applied to homebuyers.Typically, the largest increases come in the run-up to a stamp duty holiday ending, when people are keen to take advantage of the tax break while it lasts, so we could see a bubble next spring.On all purchases there is a surcharge if it is a second home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba1ff33a014ac5f1ba450c4a05d1fcab013bd9ab/0_63_5500_3302/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21f9f879f54fe0e0f0674fe167ab29e6","title":"we didnt expect this kind of treatment from a luxury spa","story":"It has refused a refund after our hen party booking was cancelled because of coronavirusI realise there must be so many people right now who are grappling with refunds for bookings made prior to coronavirus.

Practically, like many other companies, it’s seeing what it can get away with to keep its cashflow going. Its own terms and conditions state that if it has to cancel a booking due to exceptional circumstances it will refund the money. The government regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, has confirmed that customers are entitled to a full refund if their contract is cancelled due to Covid-19, and companies that refuse to pay up may be in breach of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.“We are committed to ensuring we are flexible with customer bookings by making movements of dates to later in the year without charging additional administration fees and providing an alternative to hold the booking in place for 12 months. However, we will not be authorising any refunds across our customer base.”You would have a strong case in the small claims court, or you could attempt a chargeback through your card issuer if you paid by credit or debit card.Champneys, which has closed its phone lines and chatbot, did not respond to my requests for a comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e3bcf27c738c1a9f5621920d46cadf518962d1/0_154_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323b6530364202f602910467e8ef79e7","title":"taking on sir humphrey can the civil service be reformed podcast","story":"Michael Gove has set out his plans for a revolution of Britain’s permanent bureaucracy, the civil service.

From then on, it was this institution, comprising hundreds of thousands of apolitical government employees, that would be tasked with turning the new ideas into reality.  Powell tells Anushka Asthana that it was not easy: many officials are reluctant to run with new ideas, or tend to look for problems rather than solutions. It’s an issue that the current Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has also identified. In a recent speech, he promised to shake things up: move more civil servants out of London, make them take more risks, and become more specialist and numerate.

Instead, he appears to be front and centre again.He and the cabinet minister Michael Gove have overseen the departure of Sir Mark Sedwill, the government’s most senior civil servant folded the Department for International Development into the Foreign Office made plans to cut the government communications team of 4,500 people across more than 20 departments and introduced a White House-style plan for televised briefings.There is more to come, say insiders. Following Wednesday’s announcement that Cummings has been granted permission to visit five of the UK’s top secret security sites ahead of the looming integrated review, he will have a role cutting waste in the ministry of defence.Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union which represents the UK’s most senior civil servants, said: “Dominic Cummings may or may not have the answers to the government’s and the country’s woes, but what appears increasingly clear is that the centralisation of power and policy is the means by which the prime minister intends to execute it.”Cummings’ re-emergence has brought a sense of relief to some close to Downing Street. One source said: “It’s a bit like swimming with a shark – when you can see his fin, at least you know where he is.”Cummings has written extensively about the need to stop wasteful spending in the Ministry of Defence, a department regularly criticised by the National Audit Office for failing to deliver multi-billion-pound schemes on time or within budget.Articles on his blog have argued in favour of using artificial intelligence and drone technology as opposed to traditional defence equipment.So Whitehall officials may be concerned to see that he appears to be spearheading Johnson’s review of armed forces spending.Any attempt to cut the budget or the personnel will face opposition from the military’s top brass and their supporters on the Conservative backbenches.Buried in the detail of Rishi Sunak’s summer statement on Wednesday was £100m of taxpayer backing for a leading-edge green technology known as “direct air capture”.It involves removing carbon dioxide from the air and compressing it into a form that can then be buried or stored. Cummings is enthusiastic about the technology, colleagues say– as is another government adviser, Tim Leunig– hoping the UK could become a world leader in it.It’s just one example of the government’s willingness to take bets on R\u0026ampD with public money and one definition of what Johnson meant when he repeatedly promised to “unleash Britain’s potential” during the election campaign.Cummings is pushing through the creation of a UK version of Darpa, the US Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, set up under Eisenhower in the 1950s, which backs new technologies and helped support the creation of technologies including the internet and GPS. The budget in March earmarked £800m to create the organisation, described as a “blue skies” science research agency. Sajid Javid resigned during the February reshuffle, when he was told that his special advisers – including those dealing with the media – would be combined with No 10’s. Afterwards he joked that he wouldn’t comment on “Cummings and goings” – acknowledging the role of Johnson’s right-hand man in his departure.Last week it became clear that the change was just the beginning of a dramatic reorganisation of government communications, which will put Downing Street in the driving seat.While Cummings remains the lightning rod for criticism, the shakeup is as much the brainchild of Johnson’s director of communications, Lee Cain.Scores of departmental civil service press officers will see their jobs disappear, and those who remain will be line-managed by the Cabinet Office, instead of their own, home departments. Johnson’s team are scathing about the quality of some Whitehall press offices and want to centralise and standardise the messages emerging from government. Critics say it is a further blow to the independence of cabinet ministers.Recruiting scientists – and weirdosThe government announcement on Wednesday, that it had created a new Office for Talent based in No 10 as a way to help leading scientists, researchers and others live and work in the UK, will come as little surprise to those who have observed Cummings closely. His obsession with bringing in scientists and outside talent into the orbit of No 10 has been a striking feature of Johnson’s seven-month tenure.In January, Cummings wrote a rambling blog calling for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to apply for new jobs in No 10. He wanted data scientists, economists, policy experts, project managers, communication experts and junior researchers, one of whom would become his personal assistant. Special advisers, whose contracts have been changed to give No 10 more power over their jobs, have been ordered by Cummings to read books promoting superforecasting as part of a training regime he arranged for the summer.At a recent briefing, they were told to read the 350-page book Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction by Philip Tetlock and High Output Management by Andrew Grove, which claims that “only the paranoid survive”.Cummings’ obsession with superforecasting, which examines how historical patterns can be used to make accurate predictions, was blamed for his recruitment of Andrew Sabisky, who calls himself a “superforecaster”. He was recruited to No 10 earlier this year but quickly stood down after it was disclosed that he had previously praised eugenics and argued that intelligence was inherited."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0748119492880663b2787ec8c35aa95af20337/0_0_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccc933f3d8faabd789a99f0071c9688","title":"young people tell us how rising unemployment rates are affecting you","story":"We’d like to hear from those under 25 who have lost jobs, or are struggling to get work, due to coronavirusThe chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce a temporary job creation scheme which will fund six-month job placements for an estimated 350,000 18 to 24-year-olds.We’d like to hear from those under 25 who have been made unemployed, or are struggling to get a job, due to coronavirus.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Mizzling rain wiped out the first three hours of the first Test and for a spell it looked as if the weather might hold sway all day a cruel joke after a sun-drenched spring and early summer.But come 2pm, after Ben Stokes and Jason Holder had produced a moment of socially distant mirth through an awkwardly duffed handshake at the toss, and players and coaches on both sides took a knee to denote the Black Lives Matter movement, Test cricket’s 129‑day hiatus was over.It has not returned in the same shape but rather as a made-for-TV product in ridiculously pared-back form. No supporters, no corporate boxes, no sponsor activation hubs or programme sellers. Just 13 cricketers and two umpires on a green stage in the Hampshire countryside, with Spidercam hovering overhead and a smattering of workers looking on.The first three overs, before another shower swept in to force another break, gave a taste of what is to come this summer. When Dom Sibley shouldered arms to Shannon Gabriel and the opener’s off stump received the kind of trim his lockdown locks are in need of, the eerie silence was briefly disturbed.International cricket has been played in near-empty stadiums before. But in England? At this point, after a couple of hours drinking in the rain, the home crowd would normally be letting out a collective sigh at Sibley’s misjudgment to go with pockets of cheers from those supporting the tourists. Yet the only sound bouncing around the empty stands of the Rose Bowl was of West Indies players congratulating their now fit-again battering ram and only then through a collection of fist bumps and foot kicks, rather than high fives and hugs.The need for such restraint in the moment was a disappointment but the wicket was a relief of sorts. The setting for this Test may be sterile and the protagonists are coming in slightly underdone but, regardless of the vacuum, Sibley will likely attest to being in a serious battle during the four balls he faced.It has been a fair effort to get to this point. After last summer’s World Cup and Ashes delux combo meal, Steve Elworthy, the director of events for the England and Wales Cricket Board, was probably expecting a slightly quieter 2020 (the launch of the Hundred notwithstanding).But he and his team have been plunged into a world of medical protocols, ground schematics, zones and one-way systems, juggling a headcount of 300 and trying to keep everyone within it healthy. Every element of staging a major match day, something the ECB has had down pat for a while, needed to be broken down and rethought through the prism of Covid-19 in order to get the game back on and, crucially, keep the Sky money rolling in.The so-called “Lord’s hum” on television may help trick minds at home but the measures put in place to receive government sign-off for this series were always going to deliver a slightly dystopian experience in person.Entering the bubble – or at least the outer zone permitted for day workers, such as the 12 members of the written press – actually began a couple of days ago, when one of the ECB’s Covid-19 testers knocked on my front door and stuck a swab in my nose and throat. Not exactly an Amazon delivery.With no news being good news on this front and having spent the previous week filling out a daily health questionnaire, arrival on site was then a case of passing through not one but two thermal scanning units – tents with infrared cameras – before following the one-way system to the new press box.A converted suite in the Shane Warne stand, it has 12 desks spaced at least two metres apart, all of which have face masks and alcohol wipes ready for use. Hand-sanitiser stations dotted everywhere around the ground – including the boundary’s edge – further the feeling of being in hospital rather than hospitality.The players and coaching staff have been living on site and experiencing this weirdness for some time now while the outside world piles back into the pubs and the cinemas, they still find themselves having to stand in the corner of lifts facing away from each other and eating breakfast at separate tables.But the early signs on the field are that they have adjusted to the new normal. Once it fades into the background for the rest of us – and provided the bubble doesn’t burst with a viral outbreak – the contest should become the chief talking point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51445dae50bf11b04c360a591e189d684313023c/68_0_4347_2609/master/4347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c290557f534337f8895b6ff5f0bd72a4","title":"premiership covid 19 tests 10 positive results","story":"Saracens, Harlequins, Northampton and Worcester are among the clubs with confirmed cases of coronavirus following Premiership Rugby’s first round of testing. PRL announced that of the 804 tests, six players and four members of staff have yielded positive results, bringing into sharp focus the main threat to the resumption of the season in mid-August.The identities of the iniduals infected have been kept confidential but Harlequins and Northampton have both confirmed one positive test each, while Saracens have had at least one. It is understood that two members of Worcester’s staff have tested positive but there are no cases at Bristol, nor among the Sale squad.The 12 Premiership clubs this week returned to stage two of testing – which allows for contact training including scrummaging, mauling and tackling drills. But it is understood that they did not begin until the results of Monday’s testing were known.The 10 iniduals to test positive – who have not been named – will now isolate along with their close contacts, but Premiership Rugby faces an anxious wait to learn the results of the second round of testing next week, after contact training has been in full swing.“The most important thing is that rugby does need to get back up and running. The clubs need it, everyone needs it. We need that to be as diligent as possible across all the clubs. Hopefully people will follow protocols to make sure it doesn’t get larger than that.”Players have been training in groups so far but their close contacts will be determined on an inidual basis, using video footage of all sessions and the monitoring of their GPS movements. No timeframe has been set on when the six players or four members of staff can resume – that, too, will be done on an inidual basis, taking into account things such as whether or not they are symptomatic.Meanwhile, Youngs has tipped Manu Tuilagi to make next year’s British \u0026amp Irish Lions tour despite the acrimonious end to his Leicester career. Youngs confirmed that Tuilagi has played his last match for the Tigers after refusing to accept a pay cut and while the scrum-half does not believe the Rugby Football Union should bend its rules to make the centre eligible for England if he goes abroad, the centre has been tipped to tour South Africa next summer.“Manu is an unbelievable, exceptional talent,” added Youngs. “I’m sure he’s got every opportunity of making that tour whether he’s playing in England or not. Do I feel let down by Manu? Absolutely not. He has given a huge career to Leicester and his family has been a dynasty. There comes a time in anyone’s career when you change it up.”Youngs also believes a reduction in England players’ £25,000 match fees is inevitable after the RFU announced plans to make 139 redundancies. He said: “There’s no doubt it’ll be amended and changed,” he said. “I’d be very surprised if it wasn’t the case.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa03c5570d3b4823efc4f318d5ac7d5aba6882f1/158_0_4644_2788/master/4644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cc989709bcefe0d31f1b9f28465ad39","title":"michael holdings eloquence skys unflinching masterpiece on race","story":"Viewers watching England’s first Test of the summer were given an uncompromising alternative to cakes and sixesWest Indies were flying a Black Lives Matter flag from their balcony. It was one of the first things you saw as the cameras panned across the empty ground on the opening morning of the opening match of this strange and delayed cricket season.Later, when they came out on to the ground, you could see their players were wearing one black glove each. Both teams took the knee before the start of play and as they did it West Indies raised their gloved fists in salute, a clear, conscious echo of the protests made by the sprinters John Carlos and Tommie Smith as they stood on the podium at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico.You can’t understand the history of cricket without understanding the history of empire. You can’t appreciate the rivalries between these, and other, teams, without appreciating the relationship between our countries, what’s been given, and what’s been taken.You can’t understand the hostility of Michael Holding’s bowling without understanding what made him so angry, you can’t appreciate Frank Worrell’s grace as a captain without knowing something of the prejudice he faced, you can’t value the violence of Viv Richards’ batting without a sense of what he was fighting against.You can’t separate sport from politics, or have the cricket without the cause. But plenty of people would like to. Sky, to their credit, didn’t let them.Midway through the very first over, their live footage was stuck on a slow-mo of Kemar Roach walking back to his mark, and they were unable to cut away in time to capture his fourth or fifth deliveries. In between his ad-libs describing what we were missing, Holding explained they were having “technical hitches”. Their cameras were down. Imagine the flap. You could almost hear the engineers swearing. They shouldn’t worry because their broadcast won’t be remembered for the little things they got wrong but the big things they got right.During the first of many rain delays, they delivered a brilliant half-hour of sports broadcasting. It opened with a quote from James Baldwin: “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced,” and followed up by making good on the promise of those words.They did it by focusing on the experiences of Holding and Ebony Rainford-Brent. The latter spoke about “the constant drip, drip” of racism she had put up with during her career in English cricket, all the loaded remarks about her hair, her body and her food, “day in, day out”, the way a coach always referred to “your lot” in conversations with her.Rainford-Brent, the first black woman to play for England, is known as one of the warmest people on the cricket circuit. She broke down as she explained how her jovial personality had been shaped by her reluctance to push back against those prejudices.The film included footage of Mike Gatting, the former MCC president and current ECB ambassador, being heckled by anti-racism campaigners for taking “blood money” on the rebel tour to apartheid South Africa. And if the point wasn’t clear enough, Rainford-Brent pressed it by pointing out the structural racism in the England and Wales Cricket Board, and at all levels of the game in England. She bluntly pointed out there are no black members of the ECB board, no black directors of cricket, no black chief executives, and no black captains among the 18 counties and that black participation in grassroots cricket is tiny.Holding continued, live on air, with an extraordinary monologue that took in everything from the recent video of Amy Cooper threatening to call the police on a black man in Central Park who asked her to put her dog on a lead, to the historic representation of Christ as a white man, to the erasure of Lewis Howard Latimer (the black man who perfected the lightbulb) at the expense of Thomas Edison. Holding spoke about research at Yale that revealed the extent of unconscious bias among pre-school teachers and he spoke about research by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that showed how white policemen invariably overestimate the age of black children.It was eloquent, intelligent, and confrontational broadcasting, fiercely uncompromising stuff for an audience who were tuning in because they wanted the comfort and relief of live cricket, of cakes and sunshine and sixes.And it was capped by Nasser Hussain. “People will be tuning in and saying: ‘Not this again,’” Hussain said. “All I’ll say to those people who say ‘not again’ is that a few weeks ago I watched a black man being killed in front of my eyes on Channel 4 news, and my natural reaction was to look away. Next time that footage came on, I forced myself to watch because I felt something inside of myself say: ‘You’ve been looking away too long.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8db5becbbc007399095925c63e25e8da90209537/1034_1681_5149_3089/master/5149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47660606e48213797fa6a337e88c7ef1","title":"77 per cent comedy venues in uk face closure survey emergency arts funding coronvirus","story":"Fears sector will be overlooked when £1.57bn emergency arts funding is allocated Three-quarters of British comedy venues face closure within a year without financial support, according to a survey of hundreds of people in the industry who say they fear the government is ignoring the sector.The LCA, which is a new body set up to represent the sector, said that without help venues would go bankrupt, jobs lost, comics would quit and many would never return. It is calling for comedy not to be overlooked when the £1.57bn emergency arts fund, which was announced by the government on Sunday, is allocated later this year.Unlike theatre, opera or the visual arts, comedy is not supported by Arts Council England and does not receive funding from the Department for Digital, Culture, Music, and Sport (DCMS).The standup Fern Brady has estimated that the Covid-19 crisis has cost her £10,000 in lost income, with panel shows and live gigs stopping overnight when lockdown measures were implemented in March. She said comedy had been “invisible” so far in the debate about saving the arts.“I’m one of the lucky ones because I also do writing work,” Brady said. “I’ve got friends who’ve been comedians for 15 years who have to go back to the job that they did before. Can you imagine writing ‘standup comedian’ on a CV or a job application? A lot of people don’t see this as a legitimate job.”Owen Donovan, the vice-chair of LCA and the managing director of comedy production company Berk’s Nest, said the situation for venues was “incredibly bad” and that they needed help if they could not reopen for several months.Donovan said the comedy sector wanted to have equal access to the emergency arts fund. “When the government talks about key institutions or organisations being saved, all we’re asking is for an eye to also be cast over what those key institutions and organisations are in the comedy landscape,” he said.The comedian Mark Watson said: “This is one of the fastest-growing, most egalitarian and fashionable pockets of the arts, and it produces work on a fraction of the budgets enjoyed by theatre, opera, or anything else. Any rescue plan for the performing arts needs to include it.”“There was already a problem. A lot of middle-class people dominate in the comedy world,” she said. “Perhaps now it’s just going to be Cambridge footlight people who can keep doing comedy and those whose parents pay their rent for them.”A DCMS spokesperson said: “This week we announced the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture to help the industry through the coronavirus pandemic. This funding will provide targeted support to organisations and venues across a range of sectors and detailed eligibility criteria will be set out in the coming weeks.”In March, two days after lockdown measures were implemented, the comedian Liam Williams told the  if he was still relying on live gigs as a main source of income then the situation would have been “absolutely ruinous”.Brady said a generation of younger comics, who are reliant on live gigs to make money, could leave the industry and not return. “Established comedians like me are fine, I’m going to do a podcast till the end of the year. But there are brilliant comedians just under me, who were just kind of getting started, and I don’t know what’s gonna happen to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4aa2f75b6c5bbc22e1254adf8c785dd313670a4/84_45_1364_819/master/1364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87f256246f9ac134e5d5d567c159ff70","title":"helen mccrory interview national theatre stream deep blue sea rattigan","story":"As the National Theatre streams a bold revival of Terence Rattigan’s The Deep Blue Sea, its star discusses a potent mix of sensuality and tormentDirector Carrie Cracknell described one day in rehearsals with you as an “almost spiritual experience”. How would you define your collaborative relationship? We first worked together on Medea in 2014. We took Ben Power’s new adaptation and delivered an all-singing, all-dancing production of a Greek tragedy set in the 20th century on to the massive Olivier stage in six weeks. So ours was a collaboration formed in the furnace. We worked together at breakneck speed. So when we came to work on The Deep Blue Sea, the task seemed much simpler.I hope I speak for Carrie, too, when I say we now have an implicit trust and respect for each other. Carrie possesses a rare quality that all the best directors have: no ego. The best solution in the rehearsal room is used, she has no concern who it belongs to, just that the play is served. She encourages everyone to trust their instincts and never attempts to dominate but quietly edits, taking ideas and losing others. The Deep Blue Sea was one of the most profoundly happy experiences I have ever had in a rehearsal room. She has a gentleness and non-judgmental quality that make you feel you could do anything. I hope we have the opportunity to do it again.How does this production upend expectations about how Rattigan is done?Carrie definitely threw the dust sheets off how Rattigan should be produced. First, she worked with Tom Scutt, designing the inside of a postwar London boarding house as an open set, a skeleton of a building where each sound was amplified, where the tenants all heard each others’ footsteps, arguments and secrets. All washed through with the colours of a deep blue sea. I then played most of the performance in my slip and dressing gown. I wanted to feel that this world was a woman’s private space, constantly invaded by others and a woman whose sexuality had driven her to a very dark place. Lighting and sound design were then used to create the outside world that broke into the interiors in a sharp, discordant way. The result was almost expressionistic.Rattigan’s writing can be incredibly subtle and full of subtext. Is there a specific line or moment that you think encapsulates your character Hester’s position?“When you’re caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, the deep blue sea can seem terribly inviting.” It could have been written by Tennessee Williams and some nights I played Hester with that heady sensuality that Williams’s characters can possess. In the NT Live recording we started 15 minutes late so I remember having a brusque, brittle quality that lying under a blanket backstage in the dark and cold can give you! But it’s valid, she has many qualities and different ones dominated on different nights. That’s the fun of live performance – it really can change radically from night to night.Hester is desperate. How important have the arts been in raising awareness of mental health issues, both in the 50s and now?Hester is suicidal, something that Rattigan understood implicitly as the play is based on his own experience of losing his lover of 10 years to suicide by gas poisoning. The entire play can be seen as a love letter to him, asking him at the end of the play not to succumb to the deep blue sea but to live. It has a poignancy and heartache throughout, on one hand understanding the fragility, anger and shame that can drive someone to the brink of suicide but on the other asking that sometimes you have to put one foot in front of another and keep walking on even when you feel no sense of hope or purpose because you mustn’t give up. It has a beautiful wisdom and simplicity. I don’t think I’ve ever heard the term “mental health issues” in a rehearsal room. Actors tend to see all reactions as part of the human experience. We don’t say this is normal, this is not normal, as a social worker or a psychiatrist might because the actor must always empathise with the character in order to portray them and everything is encompassed within that. Perhaps that attitude destigmatises human behaviour and helps an audience to question why someone might be behaving in a certain way, rather than are they “right” or “wrong” to do so. Because change can only be brought about through understanding.You can almost smell the damp and the cigarette smoke in the production, partly thanks to Tom Scutt’s green-tinged set. Did that mood, and Hester’s troubled character, affect your life off stage?Once the curtain’s down and I’m out of the shower, that’s Hester gone. If you’re ever looking for a fun crowd after a show, find a company that’s just done an emotional performance. All we want to do is laugh, dance and be merry. It’s that comedy lot you want to avoid ...Very early in your career you had a lead role at the National in Trelawny of the ‘Wells’. What are your memories of that time?They are very, very happy and very, very vague. I remember I played footie in my obligatory Doc Martens (well it was the early 90s) with the stage crew before the show as my warm-up. I had the most incredible ball gowns that we got me into in 47 seconds (my quick change between act one and act two used to get its own round of applause, I was thrilled). I remember working with the great Michael Bryant, whose ashes now lie under the stage at the National. (I’m not sure if that’s true or just an urban myth, but I always say hello to him every night before I warm up.) And I vividly remember enthusiastically congratulating a young director in the bar one night after the show, on his great achievement of directing at the National. It turned out the young director was Richard Eyre, head of the National and my boss. He was completely charming and didn’t say anything so as not to embarrass me. Happy days.You set up a scheme to feed the NHS at the start of the pandemic – what are your current plans for the scheme and how has it gone?FeedNHS joined up with MealForce and BaxterStorey and was, at its peak, feeding 45,000 meals a day to over 100 hospitals across the nation. We have wound down now, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who donated and also to say despite having to design websites (like having teeth pulled), spending days on calls which all began by screaming “Can you hear me?!” before losing connection as wifi dropped out again, learning that the NHS is a series of trusts all of whom must be contacted independently, Damian (Lewis, McCrory’s husband), John Vincent (head of Leon) and I met the most inspirational philanthropists, hard-working NHS staff, altruistic chefs, kind and selfless delivery people and a wealth of good-hearted people. It was a wonderful experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bab77f7f8846477f069c3ddcbee43dd52059f59/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acc5a8bee8efc0f6d9f437993168e90a","title":"roger stone facebook pages accounts","story":"Company says fake accounts promoted Trump ally’s books while material tied to Bolsonaro spread isive messagesFacebook has suspended numerous pages linked to the longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone as well as a network of accounts associated with Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, in separate moves to tackle disinformation and fake accounts on the platform.The company on Tuesday took down 50 personal and professional pages connected to Stone and his associates, including a prominent supporter of the rightwing Proud Boys group in Stone’s home state of Florida, saying they had used fake accounts and followers to promote Stone’s books and posts.Facebook moved against Stone on the same day it took down accounts tied to employees of Bolsonaro’s family, which it says were used to spread isive political messages, as well as two other networks connected to domestic political operations in Ecuador and Ukraine.The company said that despite efforts to disguise who was behind the activity, it had found links to the staff of two Brazilian lawmakers, as well as the president and his sons, the congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro and the senator Flávio Bolsonaro.The allegations by Facebook add to a burgeoning political crisis in Brazil, where Bolsonaro’s sons and supporters have been accused of running a coordinated online campaign to smear the president’s opponents.Researchers at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, who spent a week analysing the activity identified by Facebook, said they had found five current and former political staffers who registered and operated the accounts. Some of those accounts posed as fake Brazilians and news outlets to spread “hyper-partisan views” supporting Bolsonaro and attacking his critics, said the researcher Luiza Bandeira. Their targets included opposition lawmakers, former ministers and members of Brazil’s supreme court.More recently, the accounts amplified Bolsonaro’s claims that the risks of the coronavirus pandemic are exaggerated. The disease has killed more than 66,000 people in Brazil and Bolsonaro himself tested positive this week.“We have known for a long time that when people disagree with Bolsonaro they are targeted by this machine that uses online disinformation to mock and discredit them,” said Bandeira.Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, said there was no evidence the politicians themselves had operated the accounts. “What we can prove is that employees of those offices are engaged on our platforms in this type of behaviour.”Gleicher also said that, in the case of Stone, the removals were meant to show that artificially inflating engagement for political impact would be stopped, no matter how well connected the practitioners.“It doesn’t matter what they’re saying, and it doesn’t matter who they are,” Gleicher told Reuters before the announcement. “We expect we’re going to see more political actors cross this line and use coordinated inauthentic behavior to try to influence public debate.”Facebook officials said they took down Stone’s personal Facebook and Instagram pages and his Stone Cold Truth Facebook page, which had 141,000 followers. A total of 54 Facebook accounts and 50 pages were removed for misbehavior, including the creation of fake accounts. The accounts spent more than $300,000 on advertisements over the past few years, Facebook said.Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, was briefed on the actions beforehand, officials said.The removals risk further angering Trump and other conservatives who accuse Facebook of suppressing rightwing voices. Facebook last month took down a Trump re-election ad that included a Nazi symbol, and it pledged to steer users to facts on voting when Trump, or anyone else, touches on the topic.Facebook is under pressure from civil rights advocates and allied groups as well, and hundreds of advertisers have joined a boycott demanding the company crack down on hateful and isive messages.Stone was convicted last year for witness tampering and lying to Congress as it investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. He is due to report to prison next week. He did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.In search warrant documents released this April, the FBI said a Stone assistant told interviewers in 2018 “that he purchased a couple hundred fake Facebook accounts as part of this work”.Facebook said its investigation was influenced by the April search documents. But the company said that its unit guarding against coordinated inauthentic behavior had already been looking into Stone’s pages after a referral from a separate Facebook team monitoring dangerous organizations, which was tracking the Proud Boys.Ben Nimmo, a disinformation specialist at Graphika, said the Stone network had been most active in 2016 and 2017, among other things promoting stories about the Democratic emails published by WikiLeaks as part of the Russian interference effort.Many of the accounts were later deleted, and in recent weeks they have mostly reflected Stone’s quest to receive a pardon from Trump for his crimes, according to Nimmo.“The inauthentic accounts were amplifying various Stone assets, like his page, or advertising one of his books,” Nimmo said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b840bb547121bdb6f30b0a06b2a8f0f3ff3b4e80/290_0_4939_2963/master/4939.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=fa2801710018359715221b7538fc1a9c","title":"dell xps 13 2020 review a fantastic but flawed laptop","story":"Cons: short battery life, only two USB-CThunderbolt 3 ports, softwareBIOS issues, expensive, mics not great for video conferencing at a distance, speakers are shrill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f8cb347985fe249f3bf2fca02053e345aa0f32/0_49_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f24890e21cf7b0302467f910958bd22","title":"post lockdown camping its a taste of freedom","story":"On a first foray out of London, our writer kicks up her heels with a stay in a (freshly sanitised) yurt, boating on the Norfolk Broads – and drinks in several pubsWe arrived at our yurt and said hello to our next-door neighbour, who was stretched out on a deckchair. He replied with a grin and one word: “Freedom!”It was Saturday 4 July, the first day that campsites were allowed to open in England after lockdown. My partner and I had left our homes for the first time in nearly four months and driven to the Waveney River Centre in Norfolk, a campsite and marina, to find out what “the new normal” means for campers.We were greeted by a battalion of beaming staff, all happy to get the summer season going at last. The first of many hand-sanitiser points was outside reception, which had a one-in, one-out policy and social-distancing markers. Other than that, check-in proceeded as normal. We were staying in one of seven yurts, all fully booked for the weekend, as were the 14 caravan pitches and six camping pods. Only the 45 tent pitches had deliberately not all been filled, to keep numbers at a manageable level. (There are also 35 self-catering lodges on the site.)As is the case at many campsites, most of the facilities were open, but with some alterations. In the toilet block, alternating cubicles and sinks were taped up so people couldn’t get too close. Staff were stationed at the showers all day, ready to clean them after each use. The main shop was closed, but basic items had been moved to the ice-cream kiosk. The play area was open, but the indoor pool was sadly shut, as per (baffling) government guidance.Liam Holmes, Waveney’s general manager, said early feedback from guests had been positive, with people feeling particularly reassured by the visible extra cleaning.The campsite borders the River Waveney, and we were the first passengers on the newly reopened foot ferry. The service, which dates from the 19th century and was revived in 2012, originally carried south Norfolk villagers to Lowestoft fish market. These days, it takes visitors to Carlton Marshes nature reserve, just across the Suffolk border. We wandered around the marshes, meadows and pools, and spotted birds including a little egret and a marsh harrier. The wide-open space was a balm after so many weeks spent in my tiny London garden.Back at the campsite, we exercised another regained right and went to the pub. The Waveney Inn had a one-way system with separate entrance and exit, and we had to give our details for contact-tracing purposes. It was table-service only, with contactless payment for our Southwold bitter, fish and chips and ploughman’s salad. No one seem deterred by the new measures: the pub was full of families enjoying themselves.A cold wind had whipped up by bedtime, which gave us a good excuse to light the woodburner in our yurt. The yurt smelled freshly sanitised (the particular antiviral spray used is specified on the website) and was comfortable, with double bed, sofa and electric lamps guests bring their own bedding.The next day, we hired a day cruiser from the on-site marina to explored this section of the Broads. Several campers were doing the same – there was a queue for the boats. Again, social-distancing measures were in place, with customers fitting their own lifejackets and staff issuing instructions from the bank, rather than boarding boats.We went as far as Reedham, a riverside village about two-and-a-half hours away, for a pint at the Ship Inn, then stopped halfway back at the Bell Inn at St Olave’s for lunch (a generous seafood platter). Staff at both pubs were cheerful and welcoming, and the manager of the Bell – “Broadland’s oldest recorded inn” – thanked us for supporting them. After months of nothing more exciting than a daily walk, a day’s boating on the Broads seemed like a real adventure.Back at the marina, we handed the cruiser keys back and walked a few minutes up the lane to St Mary’s church, which has a thatched roof and a ziggurat-style tower. More substantial walks include one to Oulton Broad, via the foot ferry, and on to the sandy beach at Lowestoft. More beaches are a short drive away at Great Yarmouth and Southwold.We ended the day with a barbecue on the deck outside our yurt. By the time we were ready for bed, a low moon was hanging over the river and the sky was full of stars.

Facebook groups full of intense discussions about imminent civil war.Over the past year, online conversations about the “boogaloo”, an ironic term for a second civil war, have begun to coalesce into the beginnings of an actual movement, according to experts who monitor American extremists. Facebook has designated a network of “boogaloo” groups as a dangerous organization similar to the Islamic State, and banned them from both Facebook and Instagram. At least 15 arrests and five deaths have been publicly linked to “boogaloo” rhetoric, including the murders of two law enforcement officers in California.But there’s still plenty of confusion over how to accurately label this still-developing ideology. Here’s a guide to what we know, and what we don’t, about the politics of the “boogaloo”.In response to a news story about the potential threat “boogaloo” attacks posed to people in Washington DC, Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sent a tweet denying that the “boogaloo” is “a leftwing OR rightwing” movement, and claiming: “They are simply violent extremists from both ends of the ideological spectrum.”One CNN article on “boogaloo” supporters at protests included an interview with a man who claimed to be a “left anarchist”.But extremism experts agree that “boogaloo” ideology overall is, in fact, rightwing.How do they know? For one, they look at images of the “boogaloo” flag, which is sometimes emblazoned with the names of rightwing anti-government martyrs, including Americans killed in infamous standoffs with the police at Ruby Ridge in 1992 and during the occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016.“The way we know the ‘boogaloo’ movement is a far-right movement is because they draw a line directly from Waco and Ruby Ridge,” said Alex Newhouse, a digital researcher at the Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism at Middlebury Institute for International Studies.“They hold up things like the McVeigh bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building and the armed response to Ruby Ridge as heroic moments in American history,” where citizens stood up to government oppression, Newhouse said.Like the rightwing anti-government militia and Patriot movements of the 1990s and 2000s, many “boogaloo” supporters see the current federal government as illegitimate, while remaining deeply patriotic. They revere the constitution and see themselves as the true descendants of America’s founding fathers. In their view, current US lawmakers are the equivalent of occupying British forces during the revolutionary war. Among the “boogaloo” merchandise for sale online are images of George Washington armed with a modern, AR-15-style rifle.Another clear sign that “boogaloo” boys are rightwing is their decision to show up with guns to guard private businesses, first during demonstrations against public health shutdown restrictions, and later during the protests over George Floyd’s killing, Newhouse said.While “boogaloo” supporters showed up to George Floyd protests saying they wanted to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter protesters against police violence, some also described going to protests to “defend businesses – including big national corporations – against looters and destruction”.Showing up with guns to protect big corporations from property damage is not something that most leftwing protesters would do, Newhouse said, since leftists would be more like to view corporate stores such as Hobby Lobby or Ross as “part and parcel of capitalist exploitation”.This emphasis on the importance of private property is part of what makes the “boogaloo” “very much an extreme right libertarian ideology”, Newhouse said.Support for unfettered gun rights, and fierce opposition to most or all gun control, is also central to “boogaloo” supporters, with some pro-gun advocates using the term “boogaloo” to refer specifically to the civil war that will break out if Democratic politicians ever try to confiscate Americans’ guns.While some anarchists have embraced “boogaloo” rhetoric, these are primarily are “rightwing anarchists”, who believe in “unfettered capitalism”, not leftwing anarchists, said Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism.The Department of Homeland Security’s claim that “boogaloo” is not a rightwing movement is “playing politics”, said Daryl Johnson, a former DHS analyst who was forced out of the department after Republican backlash against a prescient briefing about the growing dangers of rightwing domestic terrorism.“This is an ultra-nationalist primarily white movement of people who belong to the militias,” he said. “Could there be somebody that has different sympathies that’s part of it? Sure. It’s predominantly rightwing.”There’s no question that some “boogaloo” supporters are explicit white nationalists and neo-Nazis who use the term “boogaloo” as a synonym for a coming race war.But there’s real disagreement, even among experts who monitor extremist groups, about whether the “boogaloo” movement as a whole should be described as “white supremacist.”Analysts from the Anti-Defamation League and Middlebury’s Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism have argued that a significant number of “boogaloo” supporters are genuinely not white supremacist, and that the movement in fact has two wings, one advocating for race war and one obsessed with societal breakdown and rebellion against the government.Arguments over white supremacy have played out on public “boogaloo” Facebook groups for months, the analysts said, with some “boogaloo” supporters, particularly group administrators, denouncing white supremacists and saying they want to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, even as other members of the groups made racist and antisemitic comments and mocked moderators for trying to be politically correct.Tensions within the movement over supporting Black Lives Matter and pushing out overt white supremacists have been playing out for months, according to the first in-depth profile of the movement from journalists at Bellingcat. Some “boogaloo” memes and versions of the movement’s flag name black victims of police violence, including Oscar Grant and Breonna Taylor, among the movement’s martyrs. At the same time, some of the recent pro-Black Lives Matter statements on Boogaloo pages may have been motivated by group administrators’ desire to avoid a crackdown from Facebook moderators, Newhouse said.Other experts say that lip service from some “boogaloo” supporters about wanting to be a multi-racial movement should not be taken seriously.“We’re equivocating for the sake of an imagined audience,” said Joan Donovan, the director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School.“The idea that you would dismantle the US government at this stage is to undo the protections that have been granted to black, people, queer people, disabled people, to stop foreign policy related to immigration,” Donovan said. “There are always racialized and eugenic sub-themes in these groups. That’s what war is, at its base. It’s about who should live.”“I don’t think you can get away from the ways in which the rhetoric supports a white supremacist ideology, once you start talking about the kinds of policies or strategies they think need to be implemented.”One way to capture the complex dynamics of “boogaloo” ideology is to label it as a broad anti-government movement that is full of white power activists, said Kathleen Belew, a historian of the American white power movement of the 70s, 80s and 90s.Because there are many Americans who believe in white supremacist ideas, but have never make an explicit effort to advocate for the cause, it’s more accurate to label people involved in racist movements as “white power activists” rather than as “white supremacists”, Belew argues.Like the militia movement of the 1990s, not everyone who participates in “boogaloo” events or groups is necessarily a white power activist, Belew said. But it’s important to understand that many explicit supporters of race war are operating under the cover of a slightly more mainstream anti-government movement, she said, and that this is a deliberate strategy.“Not all the people in the militia movement would be categorized as white power activists, but most of the white power movement was located inside the militia movement,” she said. Money, guns and people routinely moved between more mainstream and more underground, explicitly violent groups, she said, and that same pattern is likely repeating today.For the Americans who are encountering armed men with Hawaiian shirts at protests in their hometowns, nuanced distinctions may not be that helpful.On the ground, experts said, there’s really no way to figure out in real time if an unknown man in a Hawaiian shirt is a neo-Nazi looking to start a race war, or an anti-police libertarian who sincerely believes that he is not a racist. Asking “boogaloo” boys about their beliefs directly is unlikely to clarify much, since neo-Nazis and white nationalists routinely lie and claim not to be racist.“No matter what your beliefs are, if you show up at a Black Lives Matter protest as a white man armed with a bunch of guns, that’s a white supremacist act, even if you don’t mean it to be,” said Emily Gorcenski, the creator of First Vigil, a project that tracks far-right iniduals and groups. “Fundamentally, it will instill fear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a868caea2dfc44ec1ffc2a70b36fd3814e92e83/0_88_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58d19adf0c64132b946ae9bbaa942090","title":"indigenous americans polynesians dna 800 years ago","story":"Indigenous Americans and Polynesians bridged vast expanses of open ocean around the year 1200 and mingled, leaving incontrovertible proof of their encounter in the DNA of present-day populations, new studies have revealed.Whether peoples from what is today Colombia or Ecuador drifted thousands of kilometres to tiny islands in the middle of the Pacific, or whether seafaring Polynesians sailed upwind to South America and then back again, is still unknown.But what is certain, according to a study in Nature, is that it took place hundreds of years before Europeans set foot in either region, and left iniduals scattered across what became French Polynesia with signature traces of the New World in their DNA.“These findings change our understanding of one of the most unknown chapters in the history of our species’ great continental expansions,” the senior author Andreas Moreno-Estrada, principal investigator at Mexico’s National Laboratory of Genomics for bioersity, told AFP.Archeologists and historians have tussled for decades over whether Oceania islanders and Indigenous Americans crossed paths during the Middle Ages, and how, if they did, that contact might have unfolded.In 1947, the Norwegian explorer and writer Thor Heyerdahl went so far as to build a primitive raft – which he called Kon-Tiki, after an Inca god – and sailed from Peru nearly 7,000km for 101 days before crashing into Tuamotus in French Polynesia.As it turns out, that is one of the islands where snippets of New World DNA showed up.Heyerdahl was convinced that people from Peru had populated the remote Pacific islands, and wanted to show it was possible. But he only got it half-right, it seems.“It is more likely that Polynesians reached the Americas, given their voyaging technology and demonstrated ability to cross thousands of miles of open ocean,” the lead author Alexander Ioannidis, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, told AFP.Travelling in outrigger canoes, Polynesians established settlements across a vast area inside a triangle formed by the Hawaiian Islands, Easter Island and New Zealand.Up to now, probably the most compelling evidence that pre-American and Polynesian cultures intersected was the sweet potato.“It is native to the Americas, yet it was also on islands thousands of miles away before European contact,” Ioannidis said.Moreover, Polynesian words for the sweet potato are similar to those in Indigenous American languages in the Andes.But sceptics pointed out that sweet potato shoots might have made it halfway across the Pacific on their own, on a piece of driftwood, for example.To look for possible points of convergence, researchers collected genetic data from 15 Indigenous American groups along the Pacific coast of South and Central America, and from 17 Polynesian islands – more than 800 iniduals in all.“We looked for long sequences of DNA with exactly the same code,” said Ioannidis.The match-up with indigenous groups in Colombia and Ecuador was unmistakable, confirmed both by traditional statistical methods, and new “big data” machine-learning techniques.The genetic material also revealed the timing of the encounter.With successive generations, DNA inherited from each parent undergoes “recombination”, whereby pieces of DNA from the mother and father are broken off and fused together.“By measuring the length of the small Native American pieces of DNA in Polynesians, we can estimate how many generations ago the contact occurred.”The date that emerged was 1200, around the time Genghis Khan invaded China and the crusades sacked Constantinople.Among the longstanding articles of belief dismantled by the new findings is the contention that Rapa Nui – better known as Easter Island – was the first place where the two cultures literally came face-to-face.New computational methods will help scientists and scholars uncover previously inaccessible stories from the past, said Moreno-Estrada.“Much of history has relied on written accounts, which are generally controlled by, and focus on, those who rule,” he said. “Genetics and data science are now allowing us to tell the perhaps even more incredible – and no less true – stories of the rest of humanity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209c090ed11aab21e1f185892858fbf039849ea5/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7319e7b804d1734975b2c3771450ac3","title":"mama boko haram nigeria maiduguri","story":"Aisha Wakil knew many of Boko Haram’s fighters as children. Now she uses those ties to broker peace deals, mediate hostage negotiations and convince militants to put down their weapons – but as the violence escalates, her task is becoming impossible. By  Chika OduahIt was another scorching afternoon in Maiduguri. In the west of the city, in Nigeria’s north-east, 51-year-old Aisha Wakil sat in her office talking to a jihadi fighter named Usman. Wakil was draped head-to-toe in fine sequinned chiffon a niqab covered most of her face, leaving visible only her dark eyes. Ka’aji, a sweet, woody incense that Wakil kept burning in a corner, perfumed the room.Wakil and Usman kept their voices down. They were hashing out a secret plan to free a 16-year-old girl who was being held hostage by Boko Haram. It was May 2019, 10 years after the Islamist group had begun terrorising Nigeria as part of a jihad it was waging against the government. The violence, which had spilled into neighbouring countries, had left more than 30,000 people dead.Over the years, Boko Haram had become notorious for kidnapping women and girls. The most infamous instance came in 2014, when its fighters captured 276 schoolgirls from a secondary school in the remote village of Chibok. But there were abductions before Chibok, and dozens after. Some of those captured were forced to become suicide bombers, and Boko Haram has used more than 460 female suicide bombers, more than any other terrorist group in history. The teenage girl who Wakil and Usman were discussing was one of the group’s latest victims. For months, Wakil had been pleading with Boko Haram fighters to free her.With soldiers and local vigilantes trying to hunt them down, the group’s members had largely fled Maiduguri, the largest city in Borno state, and the other cities in the region. They set up camps tucked away in the arid bush land stretching across northern Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Some fighters went to live in hideouts in the vast former game reserve of Sambisa forest and on the remote islands dotting Lake Chad, where they kept thousands of hostages – women, girls, men and child soldiers forced to join their ranks.After annihilating villages, the fighters would slip back to their camps. Nigerian soldiers scrambled after them, but the army’s heavy vehicles would get stuck in the spiky shrubs and the soft, sandy ground of the Sambisa. They couldn’t venture far into Lake Chad’s swampy coast, especially during the rainy season. The insurgents were swift, cruising over the land in convoys of motorbikes, and then disappearing like smoke.Wakil was one of the few people outside Boko Haram who could reach its members. She was in touch with senior fighters and, in her office that day, she was using that access to negotiate freedom for the hostage. The girl was Christian, and in interviews with the local media, her parents had been asking the Nigerian government to rescue her. Wakil wanted her out safely. She believed Usman was the right person to get the job done. He was, after all, a Boko Haram militant – a mid-ranking one, who travelled between the bush and the city for special assignments.To get to Wakil’s office, Usman had to pass through the city without attracting attention. The streets were crawling with security personnel – soldiers, police officers, intelligence agents, volunteers from the Civilian Joint Task Force, a local paramilitary vigilante group. At the time, Boko Haram attacks were on the rise again and locals moved about with caution. So did Usman. With his frayed clothes, scratched-up hands and lean frame, he fit the physical profile of a Boko Haram fighter perfectly.Usman wanted to do some good. He had decided to cooperate with Wakil, relaying her messages to the mujahideen back in the camp. Their meeting ended on an optimistic note. It seemed possible that the hostage might be freed.Maiduguri is situated within what was the longest-standing kingdom in African history, a powerful pre-colonial Islamic state known as the Kanem-Bornu empire. Established by the ancestors of the modern-day Kanuri people, the empire lasted from the eighth to the 19th century. At one point, the empire’s territory stretched east from modern-day Nigeria through Chad, to Sudan and north to Libya. The empire’s kings – first known as mai, then later as shehu, a derivative of the Arabic title sheikh – were among the first monarchs to practice Islam in sub-Saharan Africa.For a long time, Maiduguri was regarded as the “home of peace”. Life there revolved around Islamic traditions: the call to prayer echoed from mosques. On Fridays, the streets were packed with people making their way to jum’ah prayer thousands of boys sat under trees, reciting verses from the Qur’an under their teachers’ gaze.From the Sahara Desert, cascades of sand blow into the city, covering the terrain in fine layers of dust. At midday, Maiduguri is blindingly hot. It has a particular kind of dry heat that prickles the skin. At night, the heat eases off a bit, giving way to breezes rising over the murky Ngadda River, rustling past neem trees scattered across the land.Wakil moved to the city in 1989, to enrol at the University of Maiduguri. Unlike many of her fellow students, she wasn’t a member of the indigenous Kanuri people – she was Igbo, an ethnic group whose ancestral land lies in the south-east of Nigeria. It was there that Wakil was born, in 1968, and where she grew up, as the country was trying to reconcile and rebuild in the aftermath of the civil war, which ended in 1970.Wakil came from an Igbo family of devout Roman Catholics and she, too, had been deeply devoted to the faith. It led her to God, she said, and throughout her youth she took to reading her Bible and praying for hours on end. It was not until the early 90s that she converted to Islam, after meeting the man she would marry, Alkali Gana Wakil. He was Kanuri and Muslim. “According to the tradition, the woman should follow the man’s religion. I did it to maintain that culture, for peace to reign in my matrimonial home,” Wakil told me.Her relatives back home in the south were deeply disappointed with her conversion, and the fact that she, a “southerner”, had gone off and married “a northerner”. She changed her name to one of the most revered in Islam, Aisha – after the favourite wife of Muhammad and “mother of the believers”. (Today, Wakil refuses to reveal her original Igbo and Christian names.) She and her husband moved into a quaint bungalow close to the most sacred place in Maiduguri – the Shehu’s palace and adjacent mosque complex.The first time I met Wakil, in 2018, she grinned and embraced me tenderly when I told her that I was also Igbo. “It’s like being with my sister,” she said, giggling, and lifted her niqab to let me see her face. Wakil had done her best to adopt Kanuri culture. She burned ka’aji. She took on local beauty customs, keeping her hands and fingers covered in lalle, a type of henna plant dye. She followed the local expectations of a Muslim wife, too, covering her head in a hijab whenever she stepped out of her home. When her husband started telling her that he did not like the way men were admiring her face, she began wearing the niqab to conceal it.Shortly after Wakil moved to her house in Maiduguri, she decided to start leaving her front door open. She was still fairly new to the city and wanted to be welcoming. Soon, poor Kanuri boys, about six or seven years old, began streaming in. Wakil let them play in her compound. Eventually, she would let them garden with her and pick fruit from her trees. Although she already had two of her own children at the time, she started calling these gangly neighbourhood boys her “sons”. In turn, the boys called her “mama”, and to show how much they appreciated her, they started inviting her to attend their circumcision ceremonies, which she ended up sponsoring as a way to help their families, who were struggling financially.The circumcision of a Muslim boy is a sacred rite in northern Nigeria. In Maiduguri, it usually takes place when boys are about seven. Wakil was there at her newfound sons’ circumcisions, holding their hands as they flinched under the blade. When the old men finished cutting, Wakil would gently wash the boy’s penis, submerging it in ka’aji to disinfect it and keep evil spirits away. At the end, she had a chicken killed to celebrate each boy’s rite of passage.But Wakil was still getting used to the customs of north-eastern Nigeria. Some people there saw her as an outsider, a southerner. At times she felt like one, too. And as she continued to adjust to a culture that was so different from the one she grew up in, it was her sons who kept her company. They came to adore the Igbo dishes she cooked them, such as isi ewu, spiced goat’s head steeped in red palm oil. Back in those days, Maiduguri still felt like the city of peace.Around the turn of the century, life in Maiduguri started to change. After 1999, when military rule ended and civilian rule was restored to Nigeria, sectarian tensions increased. Between 1999 and 2001, to ensure that the new secular, democratic government in Abuja would not encroach on Islamic principles, 12 northern states adopted full sharia law. Christians living in the north said they felt threatened by sharia, despite officials’ promises that it would not apply to them.Religious tensions were particularly raw in the wide swathe of fertile land south of Borno state, known in Nigeria as the Middle Belt. In 2001, in one Middle Belt city, Jos, about 1,000 people were killed in violence between Christians and Muslims. In Maiduguri, that same year, a total lunar eclipse sparked a riot, after local Muslim men took the eclipse as a sign that the city was overrun with immorality. News agencies reported that the men set ablaze at least 40 hotels, brothels and bars. The 911 terrorist attacks in New York, and Osama bin Laden’s exhortations to Muslims in Africa to rise up against unbelievers, only added to these existing conflicts.Since the 90s, a man called Mohammed Yusuf had been travelling around Nigeria’s north-east, preaching against western influences. Yusuf subscribed to a radical, militant strand of the conservative Sunni branch of Islam known as Salafism. In his sermons, he attacked boko (meaning secular education) and deemed it haram (sinful). By 2001, Yusuf had a devoted group of followers, known as Yusufiyya, and people started referring to his ideology as Boko Haram.Yusuf tapped into the growing anger at rising inequality in Borno state, where most villages lacked power and clean running water, and the majority of people lived on less than $1.25 a day. He railed against government corruption, as well as the growing influence of western Judeo-Christian culture in the north. He condemned the idolisation of international football stars, the prioritising of Nigeria’s secular constitution over Islam and the government’s push to make primary education compulsory for children.In 2005, Yusuf set up the Ibn Taymiyyah mosque and compound, near Maiduguri’s train station. A few hundred of his followers moved there, settling around the train tracks. Yusuf’s rhetoric got more extreme as he agitated for the Borno state governor to enforce sharia law, beyond its formal adoption in 2000. He railed against the US invasion of Iraq, the torture of Muslim detainees in Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay. He told his followers that Nigeria was an infidel state, and it was time to prepare for jihad against the government. Meanwhile, violence between Christians and Muslims across Nigeria continued to escalate. The worldwide protests that followed a Danish newspaper’s publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad in 2005 led to more deaths in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world. Many protests turned violent, which began a vicious cycle of attacks and counterattacks between Christians and Muslims, leaving dozens dead.Wakil knew Yusuf, having befriended his wife and father-in-law around the time he began amassing a following. She saw him as another son. Maiduguri residents who knew Yusuf told me that he respected Wakil. She would cook for him in his father-in-law’s home, and urge him not to fight the government.Around this time, she noticed her other sons were spending more time at Yusuf’s mosque. “They just began disappearing,” she told me. She remembers one of the boys who went away for three months. When he returned to town, he was no longer the jovial teenager that he used to be. He came back with a quiet, brooding disposition. When she asked where he had been, he told her that he had gone somewhere to learn how to kill people.“I thought it was a joke!” Wakil told me. “Kill people?”At first, she had no idea that jihad training camps were springing up in Nigeria, let alone that one of her sons had participated, upon Yusuf’s instruction. She confronted Yusuf about it. “He didn’t deny it,” Wakil said. “He said they were preparing for jihad.” Later, she learned about a camp in the Middle Belt and her sons started telling her to call them by new names, their noms de guerre.Yusuf and his followers were becoming increasingly combative, repeatedly fighting with security agents. Yusuf’s popularity swelled after each arrest. The final trigger was a now-infamous incident that took place in June 2009. One day when Yusuf was away, his followers were riding in a convoy of motorbikes on their way to a funeral when a government patrol force confronted them to ask why they weren’t wearing helmets. The Yusufiyya argued with the patrol force, and soon shots rang out. It’s not clear who shot first, but several officers ended up wounded, and some of Yusuf’s devotees died. The government never investigated what happened.Yusuf was livid, and responded with a series of diatribes directly threatening the Nigerian government and ordering Muslims to acquire weapons. Those messages went beyond Maiduguri, recorded on DVDs and tapes that circulated across the region.Wakil realised that her sons and Yusuf were headed for trouble. She spoke to his father-in-law about her concerns, and he, too, was worried. On 21 July 2009, police raided the home of a sect member and seized bomb-making materials. The Yusufiyya burned down a police station on 26 July in Bauchi state, west of Borno, where Yusuf had a farm. Police raided the farm, killing dozens of militants. Later that day, jihadists also attacked a police station in Maiduguri and for the next four days, they terrorised the city, killing police and soldiers, and slitting the throats of civilians caught in the middle. In response to the killing spree, Nigerian troops shot more than 100 of Yusuf’s followers. Soldiers captured Yusuf and handed him over to the police, who executed him. Wakil cannot forget the night of 30 July 2009, when she saw Yusuf’s bloodied corpse on the local evening news TV broadcast.The government thought Yusuf’s death was the end of Boko Haram. But it only made things worse. After going into hiding, the group re-emerged in 2010 with Yusuf’s brutal deputy, Abubakar Shekau, as Boko Haram’s new leader. From then on, Boko Haram began targeting schools and kidnapping women. The group’s goal was to overthrow Nigeria’s government and replace it with an Islamic state.Many of Wakil’s sons were now under Shekau’s command. But as appalled as she was by the destructive path her sons had chosen, Wakil felt she couldn’t abandon them, or hand them over to the government. Throughout the nearly two years I spent following her, I never heard Wakil describe any of them as “terrorists”. These were men she had taken care of as they grew up. Now, she decided to pray for them to repent. And she kept looking after them: she gave them clothes, money and phones, believing they could be reformed with love. She took care of the wives and children they left behind in the cities. When state security agents came after Wakil’s sons, she hid them inside her home: they slept in the parlour, while she and her daughter, Ummi, slept in the next room.But she feared how far her sons would go. Maiduguri became an urban war zone. At night, the sound of gunfire filled the air. During the day, residents were afraid to gather for weddings and parties. Speaking out against the militants could get you killed, so residents kept usually silent.But Wakil was an exception. Her associations with Boko Haram were no secret. Producers at a local TV news station invited her to the studio to speak about the rising insecurity. During that broadcast, Wakil said the fighters should stop, that she was pleading to them as a mother to her sons.After that, residents and journalists started calling her “Mama Boko Haram”. She was the only woman who would publicly declare that she spoke regularly to the militants.The University of Maiduguri is the most prestigious university in Nigeria’s north-east. With its modern, expansive campus, more than 20,000 students and international staff, it is the pride of the city. And as a secular, coeducational institution, it was also an obvious target for Boko Haram.In 2012, the group carried out a series of high-profile attacks. In early January, Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria’s president at the time, admitted that Boko Haram members had infiltrated his government and the security services. Later that moth, in Kano, Nigeria’s second-biggest city, Boko Haram carried out a series of coordinated shootings and bombings that left more than 178 dead. Back in Maiduguri, not even the beloved Shehu of Borno – who had publicly denounced Boko Haram as un-Islamic – was safe. He barely escaped a suicide bombing in the central mosque where people were worshiping.That same year, Wakil got a call from one of her sons warning her not to let her daughter Ummi, who was a student at the university, go in that day. The campus was about to be attacked. Wakil spoke as gently as she could. Addressing him as “my son”, she did her best to coax him into abandoning the plan. She told him that killing innocent people was not God’s will. He said there was no way to stop the mission, because everything was already in place, but that she should protect her daughter.When he hung up, Wakil turned to Ummi and told her to rush to school. “She was telling me, go to school quickly,” Ummi later told me. “I didn’t know why she was hurrying me.” Wakil knew that her sons wouldn’t want to bomb the university with her daughter inside. Ummi was like a sister to them: she, too, had taken care of them. So Wakil used her like a human shield.When the insurgents spotted Ummi, the man called Wakil again. Why had Mama let her daughter go to campus, he asked her. After some back and forth, he said that, on Mama’s request, they were going to call off the attack.Very few people outside Boko Haram could claim that kind of influence over its members – and at first, the government considered Wakil’s relationship with them an asset. They believed she could help them open talks with the group.As the violence spiralled, in 2013 Wakil was invited to join a committee that President Jonathan had set up to open talks with the insurgents and broach the option of granting them amnesty. Wakil joined, but the talks didn’t go anywhere. Boko Haram didn’t trust the politicians, and as details of the negotiations kept being leaked to the media, the insurgents became less and less inclined to cooperate.But since Shekau had become Boko Haram’s leader, Wakil had been carrying out her own negotiations, talking to members by phone or through her informants, or meeting them in person in her home. She beseeched them to leave the group, and dozens of them did. She convinced some of them to abandon their arms, directing them to a large rubbish dump in Maiduguri where they could drop the weapon and walk away. A couple of times, militants helped her to disassemble explosives. She buried the pieces in her garden. As we walked around it together, she pointed out the spot where she had destroyed a bomb if I looked hard enough, she said, I might still be able to see pieces of it.She helped former members establish a new life in other parts of the country. One day, she gave money to some 30 ex-militants. With the money, one ended up going to the commercial capital of Lagos to work in the textile sector, she said. Another made his way to the south-east to become a butcher. According to Wakil, many of these sons were killed by vigilantes or arrested once word spread about who they were.Not everyone understood what Wakil was doing. And it wasn’t long before rumours started going around. People said she was suspiciously close to the insurgents. They wondered why her home had been spared, while just about every other area in Maiduguri had been touched by gunfire or a bomb.It was true, Wakil said, that they had agreed never to attack there. But that was because her home was considered a sanctuary by all sides. When bullets were fired in the city, it was where civilians went to seek refuge. Insurgents ran there when they were being pursued by state security and soldiers security officials ran there when they were fleeing Boko Haram.At these moments, government security agents and Boko Haram fighters sometimes came face to face in Wakil’s home, exactly as she wanted. She would bring over bowls of isi ewu and encourage the men to eat together in peace. “They will eat and they will be very happy,” she told me with a laugh. They would be wary at first, but over food they slowly warmed up enough to have frank conversations.It was Wakil’s own version of peacebuilding. But unsurprisingly, some people felt uncomfortable about her unorthodox methods. On 14 August 2016, Wakil was declared wanted by the Nigerian army after the militants released a video of the Chibok girls in captivity. In a statement, the army spokesman, Sani Usman, said that Wakil – and two other people who were wanted, a journalist and a peace activist – was “in possession of information on the conditions and the exact location” of the Chibok girls. “They must, therefore, come forward and tell us,” Usman’s statement went on.Wakil was distraught. Not only did she not know where the girls were, but for years she had been cooperating with the security services. She had met with the army’s chief of staff and kept the military informed about her activities. Now she was being treated as an accomplice. She posted a response on Facebook: “Yes I have links with Boko Haram and you have always known that,” she wrote. “I have been in the front fighting for peace long before Chibok girls were kidnapped. Nigerian security knows me too well, I am not shady. Why declaring me wanted? … this has put my immediate and extended family under a lot of pressure and I do not deserve this from the government.”The next day, Wakil turned herself in at the defence headquarters in Abuja, and was interrogated for about eight hours. Security personnel asked her for her life story, how she ended up in Maiduguri, how she came to know the insurgents. Though she was not offered any public apology, the army accepted her story and released her after 48 hours. She returned to Maiduguri and got back to work.In early September 2018, two years after her interrogation, Wakil sat in her office with two Boko Haram militants. “You hear me? We will come out,” said Ali Garga, one of the Boko Haram militants, in a gentle voice. “We don’t want any security to disturb us, like police.”Wakil sat in her chair quietly listening. She seemed worn out. The previous year, she had launched a nonprofit organisation called Complete Care and Aid Foundation. Every few weeks, she and her team would visit refugee camps, where they would distribute clothes and food to women who had lost their husbands to Boko Haram, as well as check on the storehouse where they kept bags of rice and beans.But the relief work was not her most pressing priority. She urgently wanted to get her boys to stop the violence – and it was taking a physical toll on her. She suffered from acute back pain and crippling headaches. Still, she kept going.“We drop everything, we drop everything, Mama,” Garga went on, speaking on behalf of some of the men in his unit. He did not specify just how many men wanted to surrender. A man with a hard, skinny body and kind eyes, Garga had been a cattle herder before becoming a mujahid. But he had grown tired of the guerrilla life, eventually coming around to see what Boko Haram was doing as criminal, not Islamic. He missed his cows, his home, his freedom. Later, he turned to me and explained that he was surrendering because Wakil was making it possible for him to do so.As part of the surrender, Garga said he planned to release some of the Chibok girls who were still captive. Of the original 276, about 112 are still missing. Garga, who claimed he had about 40 of them under his care in a secret location, told Wakil he would sneak out of the camp with the girls and other abductees.An hour later, Wakil said it was time for her sons to eat. She brought out plastic containers of rice and bottles of water and orange soda. The men sat quietly, scooping up the rice with their hands and then wolfing down their food, until an informant began to praise Wakil. “Mama Aisha, mother of the Boko Haram. May God bless you, Aisha. May God help you,” he said.Three weeks later, I was in Wakil’s home on a Saturday night when she ran towards me with her phone in her hand, shouting, “Ali is dead! Ali is dead!” A trusted informant, whom I had met several times, had just called her. Wakil was hysterical. She threw her body on the cold tiled floor and cried. I watched her shoulders shake up and down. She told me that when Garga went back into the bushes, some of his fellow mujahideen found out about his plan to escape with the Chibok girls. They killed him. Wakil later found out that he had been tortured.Ali Garga’s death was a huge setback to Wakil’s peace talks. Things hadn’t been going her way lately. She had sold many of her assets, including jewellery and land, and had no more money to lure the militants away from the group. Her talks kept hitting dead ends. Her informants were getting killed as they travelled between Maiduguri and the bush, where the militants were based. She never knew who did the killing. Periodically, she would get a message that another contact had been killed by a stray bullet, or drowned in a river.In late 2019, her foundation was hit with a lawsuit over allegations of fraud. She was detained shortly afterwards. According to the government’s anti-corruption agency, contractors who had supplied at least 111.6m naira (£229,000) worth of goods such as cars, maize and medical supplies to the foundation had not been paid and some of the awarded contracts were bogus.In January, I travelled to Maiduguri to see if I could visit Wakil in the prison where she and the foundation’s programme manager and country director were being held. I learned that the prison administrators had allowed her to go to the hospital to get treatment for her high blood pressure. At the hospital, Wakil told me she was innocent, blaming everything on the programme manager, who had handled the contracts. (Like Wakil, the programme manager and country director have also pleaded not guilty. The trial has been postponed until further notice, and all three suspects remain in custody.)Meanwhile, Wakil told me, the number of people joining Boko Haram was growing, despite the Nigerian military’s claims to the contrary. They were getting their hands on more sophisticated weapons: Russian anti-aircraft missiles and mortars that had been circulating in north Africa since the fall of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, as well as drones. And then there were all the Boko Haram splinter groups, which made it harder for Wakil to keep track of which faction was carrying out which attack.Despite the presence of a multinational task force of specially trained army units, and repeated claims by Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that the group has been “technically defeated”, its insurgency continues. In March, the Chadian and Nigerian armies kicked off a major offensive operation against Boko Haram. Later that month, 92 Chadian soldiers were killed in a battle that lasted seven hours. Chadian forces claimed they killed 1,000 militants in a mission launched that month. In June, militants carried out multiple attacks in north-eastern Nigeria, which left scores of civilians dead.It’s hard to say who is winning the war, but Wakil’s boys are dying before they can even surrender. A couple of days after Ali Garga was killed, Wakil called me into her bedroom to watch old videos of him. It was night-time, and I sat on the fluffy pink comforter beside Wakil, and looked at the tablet in her hands. There, on the screen, were Garga and his wife, a rifle slung over her shoulder. They were dancing in a clearing of trees. All around them, sword-carrying mujahideen danced with women, standing shoulder to shoulder, shuffling back and forth. Everyone was beaming. Under a bright sky, Boko Haram was dancing.I looked up from the tablet and saw Wakil smile as she watched her son. I remembered something she had told me one evening in her kitchen. All she wanted, she said, was for her boys to come out, so she could cook isi ewu for them and they could eat together like old times. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

Follow the latest updatesMelbourne will relax restrictions on many of the 3,000 people locked down in nine public housing towers despite surging numbers of Covid-19 cases, Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews has said. On Saturday, residents of the towers in Australia’s second most populated city were confined to their homes. Andrews said that after testing all residents, those living in eight of the high-rise buildings would be allowed to leave their homes for essential reasons, the same rules in force throughout the state. Of the tower that will remain in lockdown, Andrews said: “There are such numbers of positive cases, together with known close contacts, that the assumption has got to be that everybody in that tower is a close contact of someone who is positive.”The relaxation of rules in the other blocks relieved residents, many of whom said they had been left without sufficient food and supplies. “I can’t keep my kids any more inside. I can’t, whether they shoot me or not. I don’t think I can stay any more here, not allowed even an hour to play outside,” said Amina Yussuf, an Australian citizen of Somali descent who lives with her seven children in a two-bedroom apartment in one of the towers.Russia has reported 6,509 new cases of Covid-19, pushing its official nationwide total to 707,301 – the fourth largest in the world. The national coronavirus taskforce said 176 people had died in the last 24 hours, bringing the recorded death toll to 10,843.More on Tokyo’s record daily total of new coronavirus cases. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said 224 new cases were recorded in the country’s capital on Thursday.The total surpasses the previous record of 206 on April 17 when Tokyo and other major cities were under a state of emergency. However, Suga said there was no need to reintroduce a state of emergency, adding that it was not possible to reduce infection risks to zero after measures were lifted in May.Positive cases of Covid-19 in the city have risen in recent weeks as health authorities stepped up targeted testing among workers in the entertainment districts of Shinjuku and Ikebukuro. Nationally, Japan has had more than 20,000 confirmed infections and 980 deaths from coronavirus. Pubs in Ireland face the risk of prosecution and losing their licences over potential breaches of health regulations brought in to curb the spread of coronavirus, Irish police have said. In many of the venues, police found customers consuming alcohol but no evidence of food also being consumed and evidence of receipts to show that food had been sold. Officers also observed a lack of adherence to public health advice, such as large groups being allowed to sit at one table, little to no social distancing, no advisory signage and no Covid-19 contact tracing information being recorded.Police have since submitted a file to the director of public prosecutions for direction as to how to proceed. Prime minister Micheál Martin warned on Monday that the government could delay the full reopening of pubs on July 20 after “very worrying” scenes of packed crowds of drinkers outside some bars over the weekend.I’m Amy Walker, taking over the global coronavirus blog for the next few hours. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. I would say I’m off to practice keeping my screams inside, but who among us is not an expert at that by now? Here is a roundup of the key developments from around the world for the last few hours in our global coronavirus report: Gavin Blair reports for the  from Tokyo:Visitors to Japan’s amusement parks are being asked not to scream when riding rollercoasters so as to help prevent spreading the coronavirus, while the limited numbers of football fans allowed into stadiums this weekend will have to support their teams without singing, clapping or waving scarves.When the Fuji-Q Highland theme park reopened on 1 June after a three-month closure due to the pandemic, it asked visitors to follow the recommendations of the amusement park association and not to shout or scream.Some customers complained it was impossible to stay quiet on rides, particularly the two-kilometre-long Fujiyama rollercoaster, which reaches speeds of 130kmh and drops 70 metres at one point. Named after nearby Moun Fuji, the rollercoaster was the fastest and tallest in the world when it opened in 1996.In response, the park released a video of two stony-faced senior executives riding Fujiyama without uttering a peep, urging visitors to imitate them and “Keep your screams inside.”A mask, says Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, is a “means of reducing the propensity of someone who has got Covid-19 to spread it to others. We’re not talking about protecting yourself by wearing one, but about reducing the risk to other people.” Wearing a mask is just one measure, along with handwashing and social distancing, to try to contain Covid-19, and seems particularly useful for stopping people who have unwittingly contracted the virus, but who are not showing symptoms, from spreading (if you do have symptoms, you should be self-isolating, not going out wearing a mask). “What you’re doing,” McKee says, “is catching all the little droplets that are coming out of your mouth before they can get into the atmosphere, when they can dry out and become very small and float around as an aerosol. There is still stuff that is going to get out, but you are reducing that risk.”With so many of us still coming to terms with this “new normal”, we asked McKee and other experts to answer some common questions.Fuji News Network reports that 220 new coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Tokyo – marking a record one-day increase for the city. It was discovered that more than 220 people were newly infected with the new coronavirus in Tokyo on the 9th.The number of infected people per day in Tokyo is the highest ever.The number of infected people in Tokyo has continued to be 100 or more since this month, but yesterday was 75. Australia understands work is under way to deliver equipment needed to treat extra coronavirus patients in hospitals, and it is hoped a further 400 ICU and critical care beds can be added throughout the state.Almost two dozen healthcare workers and patients have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in recent weeks in Victoria, including doctors, nurses and paramedics. During the “first wave” of the virus that prompted a national lockdown in March, non-urgent elective surgery was put on hold to make room for suspected and known Covid-19 patients.But because it seemed Australia had Covid-19 under control by early June, hospitals began filling up again with other patients and some wards and beds put aside for Covid-19 were reallocated to general patients.Now, a senior doctor working in one Victorian hospital has told  Australia that “there is no free, or surge bed capacity, at the moment”.Victoria has recorded 165 new cases of coronavirus since yesterday, with the total number of cases now at 3,098.The overall total has increased by 156, after nine cases were reclassified – largely due to duplication.No cases new cases have been detected in returned travellers in hotel quarantine and there have been no deaths reported since yesterday. To date, 22 people have died from coronavirus in the state. China has defended the World Health Organization and lashed out at the US decision to withdraw from the UN body, AP reports, adding to a litany of disputes between the world’s largest economies and increasing geopolitical rivals.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the move was another demonstration of the US pursuing unilateralism, withdrawing from groups and breaking contracts.The WHO is the most authoritative and professional international institution in the field of global public health security, Zhao said at a briefing Wednesday, adding that the US departure would particularly hurt developing countries in need of international support.The WHO plans to send a team to China to investigate the source of the virus, which was first detected in the central city of Wuhan last year. China has said it remains unclear where the virus originated and has rejected an independent probe, but reiterated this week that it is working closely with WHO.President Donald Trump has harshly criticized WHO over its response to the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of bowing to Chinese influence. Trump said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to WHO and pressured the organisation to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 130,000 Americans.In comments Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Beijing’s response to the virus outbreak showed the ruling Communist Party has an enormous credibility problem” and that its actions fitted a pattern of behaviour that threatens freedom, democracy and the rule of law.’s Matilda Boseley and Melissa Davey report:Calls from residents in the Australian state of Victoria to mental health support services have doubled in the past fortnight as Melburnians re-enter a six-week lockdown, the chief executive of Beyond Blue has said.Victorians now make up half of all calls to the organisation, evidence that residents are under increased strain as Covid-19 case numbers rise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf3412aab2d8e46896ee1f0a78bdecf1856236a3/0_211_6331_3798/master/6331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=319c5cb4c5cfc6b263837b734ebf89c4","title":"uk coronavirus live latest news covid 19 updates","story":"IFS analysis of chancellor’s plans to be published as Sunak takes to airwaves this morningA bag of Covid-19 test samples has been found on the roadside near Tain, north of Inverness, by a member of the public. BBC Highlands is reporting the pretty jaw-dropping find – apparently the samples were discovered on the A9 near Tain and handed in to the local police station before being transferred to a laboratory team at Raigmore.The samples were being transported from Caithness General Hospital in Wick to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, according to NHS Highland, which has since launched an investigation into the circumstances.Speaking of those left behind by the chancellor’s schemes, Forgotten PAYE has expressed outrage at the lack of acknowledgement in the summer statement of the 1.75 million taxpayers who are now in their fourth month of receiving no support. They are not eligible for SEISS because they are taxed, or partially taxed, at source. It is devastating that the Summer Economic Update didn’t include an extension to the scope of SEISS to open it up to those who are still excluded and who have received £0 financial support for four months now. Most of those excluded can’t even access Universal Credit.As opposed to spending £900m on work coaches, he could instead have pledged to invest that money into the 3-5 million self-employed taxpayers who’ve received no support during this crisis, so that they can continue in their chosen professions professions which they’ve trained for and have developed skills in, professions which they were thriving in and through which they were positively contributing to the economy - until lockdown was enforced.‘Eat out to help out’ doesn’t help those people who don’t have the money to eat in the first place.‘Everyone has been able to access some support,’ is the line which Rishi Sunak keeps spouting. We hope the chancellor reconsiders his decision to continue excluding 3-5 million UK taxpayers from financial support, and sticks to his pledge to not leave anyone behind.In its interim report, the Treasury select committee identified more than 1 million taxpayers who have received nothing from the chancellor’s schemes, and the grassroots organisation, Excluded UK, estimates that between 3-5 million taxpayers in total have been locked out of support. The affected groups include, among others, the PAYE freelancers, limited company directors who pay themselves through idends, sole traders earning more than £50,000 a year, and new starters. More than 200 MPs across different parties have pledged their support for those excluded from accessing support from the government’s schemes, and the Lib Dem MP Jamie Stone founded the ExcludedUK APPG to fight in parliament for support to be extended to them.Rishi Sunak said more than a million businesses had benefited from government financial support during the crisis, but apologised to those who had not been reached.Over a million businesses have benefited, for example from the furlough scheme a million businesses have accessed some of our loans, almost a million businesses have got access to cash grants or business rates holidays.So clearly the scale of what we’re doing is reaching a lot of people. Is it going to reach absolutely every single person and every single company in exactly the way they would like? I’m sure not and I can only apologise for that.He also apologised to freelancers who feel left behind by the support schemes.Does everyone feel that they’ve been helped in the way that they would like to have been? Of course not and I can only apologise for that.The chancellor has said the £1,000 bonus being offered to businesses that keep furloughed staff in jobs until January would be a “dead weight” cost, as some employers who intend to retain workers anyway would benefit.In an apparent admittance that this means some public money will be wasted, Rishi Sunak told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Throughout this crisis I’ve had decisions to make and whether to act in a broad way at scale and at speed or to act in a more targeted and nuanced way.In an ideal world, you’re absolutely right, you would minimise that dead weight and do everything in incredibly targeted fashion.The problem is the severity of what was happening to our economy, the scale of what was happening, and indeed the speed that it was happening at demanded a different response.He said that “without question there will be dead weight - and there has been dead weight in all of the interventions we have put in place”.Away from the economy,  reports that Transport for London officers stopped more than 3,000 people from getting on buses last weekend until they put on a face covering.Last week, police and transport officers were given orders to enforce the face coverings rule after reports of people being seen on public transport without one.Face coverings were made compulsory on public transport on 15 June, except for iniduals who are exempt. Fines of up to £100 can be issued and there is the possibility of prosecution if people don’t wear one.Labour has accused the chancellor of taking a “one-size fits all” approach in its incentive scheme to persuade employers to keep on furloughed staff beyond October.My major concern with the way government is proceeding now is that they’re withdrawing the job retention scheme and the self-employed scheme at the same time, right across the whole economy.We all know that some sectors are being much more strongly impacted than others, the chancellor’s continuing with that one-sized fits all approach, we would urge him to look again at this, we have been continuously.I do find it a little peculiar that we now have this bonus that will be paid to all employers regardless of whether their business are back operating up to full capacity or not.We really need to have targeted support, this is a crisis like no other where the impact is very strongly sectoral, we should have had a more sectoral approach from the chancellor.Asked about why the job retention bonus had not been more targeted, Rishi Sunak told BBC Breakfast: I actually think it will make a significant difference, it is something that people were actually interested in calling for.Given the income distribution of those on furlough, we know that £1,000 can be a significant reward and incentive to employers to successfully bring staff back and continuously employ them.I think actually having a broad offer to all those 9 million people is the right thing to do.In situations like this and throughout this crisis I’ve always had a choice whether to act at speed and at scale, given the severity of what we’re facing, or to do things in a more nuanced and targeted way and in an ideal world you would do that.The problem with doing things in a more targeted and nuanced way is that it takes a lot longer and we don’t necessarily have the luxury of time when you’re dealing with a crisis of this magnitude.I would make the same decisions again and I’m sure if we had a more targeted approach in this instance you’d probably have me on this show saying: well, why are these people excluded?The chancellor Rishi Sunak has told BBC Breakfast the government’s support plan is one of the “most comprehensive and generous set of interventions” in the world, but acknowledged some people would still be badly affected.After outlining the schemes announced on Wednesday, Sunak said: The analysis we published yesterday which shows the totality of what we’ve done demonstrates very clearly that the lowest income households are the ones who have been supported the most by everything we have done but I would acknowledge that this has been a period of extreme hardship for many people and indeed hardship lies ahead.Sunak was later asked about self-employed curtain fitter Mark Whittaker, who said he was severely struggling and felt abandoned as he was not eligible for the self-employment support scheme.The chancellor said the scheme had helped 2.5 million people and later added: If you’re saying to me there are inidual people who are suffering hardship as a result of what’s happened then I completely agree and I sympathise with that, it is not possible to ensure that every single person is not impacted by what’s happening.We’ve shut our country and economy down for months on end, that is sadly going to have a significant impact and I’ve consistently been honest with people that hardship lies ahead and that’s why we’ve tried to mitigate as much of that hardship as possible.Are we going to be able to mitigate all of it for every single person? Of course not, but when I look at the totality of what we’ve done, I do know that it stacks up as being one of the most comprehensive and generous set of interventions out of any country in the world.Despite the focus on eating out on many of the front pages this morning, the real highlight of the chancellor’s statement was the confirmed ending of the furlough scheme in October.My colleagues Larry Elliott and Heather Stewart report that despite Rishi Sunak’s rescue package and “plan for jobs”, fears of a looming crisis of mass unemployment are visceral.Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: Redundancy notices are already flying around like confetti, so today was the day we needed the chancellor to put a stop to this with policies as bold and as necessary as the jobs retention scheme.This statement failed that test. With no modification to the JRS, that dreaded October cliff edge for businesses and workers has now been set in stone. Our fear is the summer jobs loss tsunami we have been pleading with the government to avoid will now surely only gather pace.Here is the moment the chancellor got his orders mixed up while serving customers - and not wearing a face covering - at a Wagamama’s in London.The chancellor Rishi Sunak is doing the morning broadcast round, and has just told Sky News that jobs are at risk unless economic activity returns to normal.We’ve moved through the acute phase of the crisis where large swathes of the economy were closed. We’re now fortunately able to safely reopen parts of our economy, that’s the most important thing that we can do to get things going.But we won’t know the exact shape of that recovery for a little while - how will people respond to the new freedoms of being able to go out and about again. We have to rediscover behaviours that we’ve essentially unlearned over the last few months.But unless activity returns to normal, those jobs are at risk of going which is why we acted in the way that we did.The chancellor also said he was “anxious” about the state of the economy, and that the UK was “entering into a very significant recession”.We acted at the beginning of this crisis to protect as many businesses and jobs as we could, with initiatives like the furlough scheme and the unprecedented support that we have provided to business.We did that so that when we emerged from the other side of this crisis we could bounce back as strongly as possible.Now that we’re there we want to try and make that recovery as strong as it could be, which is why having people out and about, back in restaurants, moving house, renovating homes, installing energy efficiency measures in homes.Asked if everyone who has been furloughed will go back to work, Sunak said: No. I’ve been very clear that we are not going to be able to protect every single job and it would be wrong of me to pretend otherwise.There are going to be difficult times ahead and... there are forecasts for people predicting significant levels of unemployment. That weighs very heavily on me.Good morning. I’m Lucy Campbell, here to steer you through the latest developments in UK politics and all things coronavirus as the morning unfolds.Leading the front pages this morning is the “eat out to help out” aspect of the chancellor’s £30bn emergency support package to protect against a coronavirus recession and mass youth unemployment. His summer statement - or mini budget - that he delivered on Wednesday, was packed with giveaways to tempt consumers out of their Covid-19 hibernation and to nurse the country through the pandemic.However, while offering relief in the short-term, the papers also point out that we will ultimately all have to pay for these giveaways. The Times (paywall) has worked out that public spending has soared to £189bn to get the economy through the crisis – more than we currently spend on the NHS. Meanwhile, the FT (paywall) has calculated that borrowing of £350bn will be needed this year to pay for everything – pushing the deficit to twice the size it was after 2008 – and that Sunak ultimately faces the challenge of stabilising the public finances when all this is over. “Mr Sunak will not be able to play Santa Claus forever,” an analysis piece reads.The chancellor is due to have his sums marked by economic experts as they prepare to go over his plans to boost the economy after coronavirus with a fine-tooth comb. We expect the IFS’s analysis at 9:30am. We also expect that more elements of the UK’s economy could be given the green light to reopen.Please feel free to get in touch with me throughout the morning as I work.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Two of the nursing homes worst hit by coronavirus appealed directly to then minister for health Simon Harris for help as they fought severe Covid-19 outbreaks in March and April.The private homes – Tara Winthrop in Swords, Co Dublin and Dealgan House in Dundalk, Co Louth – struggled to cope with outbreaks prompting them to make desperate, late-night pleas for help.Newly released emails show the depth of the crisis in some nursing homes, the sector most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic accounting for 985 or 56 per cent of the 1,738 Covid-19 deaths. Joe O’Donovan, chief executive of Tara Winthrop, one of the first nursing homes in Ireland to experience a Covid-19 outbreak, told senior State health officials on the weekend of March 20th-21st the facility “cannot contain the outbreak without support directly on our units” and management at the nursing home “no longer have the resources to manage the outbreak”. The situation reached crisis point at Dealgan House over the Easter weekend in April, when a director warned in an email to the HSE that if the home’s residents were to have “a fighting chance of survival, the home needs to be virtually turned into a hospital”.Both homes recorded multiple cases of coronavirus and deaths related to the disease, running to more than 20 confirmed or suspected Covid-19 deaths at each care facility. A quarter of the residents at Dealgan House died.The appeals for help are contained in emails released by health service regulator, Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA), to The  under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act. The records were redacted of information identifying iniduals and the homes. This newspaper has independently established the identity of the homes and the iniduals in the correspondence.‘Immediate threat’In an email sent at 11.15pm on Friday, March 20th, to HSE officials, Mr O’Donovan said the large Swords home needed an additional 12 staff the following day to cover symptomatic staff calling in sick and 11 staff to cover the shortfall on the Sunday.“I cannot highlight enough the immediate threat…at the home from Covid-19,” he wrote.In addition to the extra staff, Mr O’Donovan appealed for personal protective equipment (PPE), the results of swab tests, swabs for further tests and “one single contact in public health”.He warned that without further supplies of PPE, the home would breach minimum requirements “of the most recent HSE guidance note on PPE”.He had not received a response by the following day so he escalated his concerns. At 1.53pm that Saturday, he forwarded his previous night’s email to the same recipients and this time copied the then minister for health and other Department of Health and HSE senior officials.The situation at the north Co Dublin home “continues to get more serious by the hour” with more staff out sick, he said.Mr O’Donovan referred to a newspaper article published that day reporting then taoiseach Leo Varadkar telling a private Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting that in Italy nursing homes residents were not going to the hospital when Covid-19 hit but to the morgue, and that Mr Varadkar did not want that to happen here.“It has and is happening,” Mr O’Donovan wrote in his email that Saturday afternoon.Mr O’Donovan signed off, saying: “Again, I appeal for your immediate attention to this critical situation for a high-risk vulnerable group.”At 5.40pm, he sent a follow-up email expressing relief that “six personnel” had arrived to help and these were “crucial to us containing the outbreak and protecting the residents”.“We no longer feel unheard and unsupported,” he wrote. In a call with a Tara Winthrop staff member the following week, Hiqa noted that it was told that the number of staff calling in sick was increasing daily to the point that the Swords nursing home was “considering asking relatives to come and assist with caring” for the residents they were related to.The crisis was just as grave at Dealgan House when it hit three weeks later, at the Easter weekend.Direct appealFintan Farrelly, one of the home’s owners, emailed the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan late on April 11th saying he would not normally make a request “through this channel” but “as it is Easter Saturday and the situation is so urgent, I’m appealing directly to you”.“In our nursing home, people are dying and we are struggling terribly with staff absences. Many of these staff were tested weeks ago and have had no result,” he wrote.The privately owned nursing home did not know which residents were infected until they had symptoms and that “in a number of cases, the residents have passed away within hours of showing the first symptoms”, he said. They “desperately” needed mass testing of all staff and residents with next-day results, he told Dr Holohan, “so that we can get a clear picture of the situation and get the outbreak under control”.Mr Farrelly alerted Mr Harris to his concerns the next day, telling the then minister for health in an email at 8.47pm on Easter Sunday that the nursing home required extra nurses from the HSE to work day and night shifts.“I fear that when the history of Ireland’s Covid-19 pandemic is written, the failure to adequately support nursing homes during the month of March and up to the current time, will have resulted in multiple avoidable deaths and will be identified as the greatest tragedy of the pandemic,” he wrote. “We are said to be ‘all in this together’ but we feel strongly that Ireland’s most vulnerable and concentrated group, the over 25,000 residents of our nursing homes, have been and continue to be neglected by your department and the HSE. We cherish our elderly people and feel they are being badly let down by the State.” The staff had been “decimated”, he wrote, and said some who were self-isolating had not received test results, so they could in fact be “unnecessarily absent from work, thus exacerbating desperate staff shortage”.“It was not our experience that healthcare workers were prioritised for testing and it appears that prioritisation only applied to the HSE,” he wrote. Mr Farrelly said the home was desperately short of nurses “and on occasion have only had one nurse on night duty, dealing with 80 residents, some of whom are very ill”.“Our experience is that the support promised from the HSE is not forthcoming and I ask you why not?” he said in his email to the minister.‘Dire straits’Mr Farrelly said he was “very disturbed” to hear that while Dealgan was “in dire straits and our residents are dying” a local hospital in Co Louth was “practically empty of patients and is fully staffed” and nurses were told to take leave “due to an insufficient workload” and “will be called if necessary”.“This beggars belief!” he wrote.On Monday, April 13th, Mr Farrelly emailed a HSE official with a long list of what the home required, including nurses and healthcare workers. Dealgan’s residents “deserve a chance to fight this virus” at the home, he said, and the only alternative was to sent them to a local hospital.“This is not our wish nor that of families, nor I’m sure that of the HSE,” he wrote. Four days later, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) Hospitals Group stepped in and temporarily took over the management of the Co Louth nursing home. A spokesman for Dealgan House said this week the Covid-19 outbreak was closed and they had not had a new outbreak since May. The 84-bed capacity home had 22 Covid-19 deaths. Tara Winthrop said on Wednesday that it had 18 confirmed and five suspected Covid deaths at the facility, which has 140 beds. A spokesman for the home said a further five asymptomatic staff tested positive two weeks ago as part of the HSE’s weekly testing of all nursing home staff but they had isolated, recovered and returned to work. All residents subsequently tested negative, he added.The spokesman said close liaison with Mr Harris, his department and the HSE from March “enabled learnings from this experience to inform and improve the measures taken subsequently to help cope with outbreaks across the nursing home sector”.He said the Swords nursing home was “working tirelessly to protect the residents and the staff and continue to work, on a daily basis, with the experts in the HSE, Department of Health and Hiqa to fight this virus”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Customers seen drinking without evidence of food being served in small number of licensed premisesCampaigners criticise delay in changing necessary regulationsDublin had more than 430 robberies in June, up from almost 300 during same 2019 periodUS biopharma firm employing more than 1,000 in Limerick has begun late-stage trialsJobs stimulus plan will include enhanced Covid-19 restart grant scheme \u0026ndash VaradkarCovid and non-Covid residents with dementia shared room at Clonakilty care facilityNumber of children entering drug treatment has risen significantly, HRB data revealsRoseanne Joyce advised by Tipperary council to return to parents\u0026rsquo crowded Nenagh homeMinister for Finance seeks election in contest with Luxembourg and Spanish counterpartsPeople unaware emergency dental services continued to operate throughoutIf we crowd animals together in large numbers to feed ourselves we maintain a high risk from emergent zoonotic diseaseNew emails reveal depth of Covid crisis at two homes during outbreaks in March and AprilHSE could not isolate residents and control coronavirus at Clonakilty hospitalResearch Lives: \u0026Aacuteine O\u0026rsquoToole, PhD student at University of EdinburghESB found liable for catastrophic flooding which damaged many homes and businessesFrank Feighan withdraws remark about RT\u0026Eacute staff \u0026lsquosnorting cocaine all over the place\u0026rsquoMinister hails number of downloads in less than two days as a huge achievementT\u0026aacutenaiste flags cuts in business taxes and commercial ratesLeaked letter from UK international trade secretary offers stark warnings about plansStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4299546.1594240224!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government targets young workers in economic plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle: Mr Varadkar said the stimulus package would be ‘radical and far-reaching’.  Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSectors which employ large numbers of young workers will be targeted under a new multibillion-euro plan to reboot the economy as the Government aims to cut the level of youth unemployment significantly by the autumn.At a meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party on Wednesday evening, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar also said the July jobs stimulus plan would work rapidly to support businesses, including through a newly enhanced Covid-19 restart grant scheme.A Cabinet committee on economic recovery met on Wednesday to discuss the plan and sources say a major focus of discussions was youth unemployment. Measures under consideration include a significant investment in apprenticeships, as well as back-to-education allowances for those on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, to enable them to learn new skills and transition off the enhanced Covid-era social welfare.Special consideration will be given to supporting the arts, with a focus on sectors which have a proven track record of supporting employment.The stimulus package will have a particular focus on sectors that employ a large number of young workers including hospitality, retail, construction and tourism.The Cabinet committee is also examining plans to extend the rates holiday introduced for an initial three-month period in March, perhaps as far out as the end of the year, although no final decision has been taken. VAT cutHowever, some sources expressed scepticism about the possibility of a targeted cut in VAT for the hospitality sector, where a cut from the current 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent has been mooted. Industry groups had called for such a measure after the UK reduced the VAT on hospitality services from 20 per cent to 5 per cent. However, there is concern about the effectiveness of such a step in Government, with doubts over how effective it would be at driving footfall and generating revenue for businesses.There are concerns as well about the difficulty of restoring the full rate, were it to be cut. The last government faced a major political battle when it moved to rescind VAT cuts given to the hospitality industry during the financial crisis.Other key points of the plan will include a significantly enhanced restart grant to help businesses that are reopening, as well as reductions in business taxes and commercial rates. There will also be access to low-cost loans. Crucially, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme may be extended beyond its current cut-off date at the end of the summer. ‘Radical’Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar said the stimulus would be “radical and far-reaching”. The plan is expected to be launched the week after next.He said the package would “help our country recover, repair the damage that has been done, and restore confidence and prosperity”.“It will be followed in October by the National Economic Plan, published on the same day as the budget. It will chart out our longer term, jobs-led recovery.“I expect the economic plan will include a major re-skilling programme, policies to promote balanced regional development and it will emphasise the importance of attracting and sustaining foreign direct investment.”The Republic’s unemployment rate stood at 22.5 per cent in June, albeit down from 26.1 per cent in May, as the economy continued to open up following Covid-19 restrictions, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO).In a statement after the Cabinet committee meeting, a spokesman for the Government said it was “agreed that the stimulus package would need to be of sufficient speed and scale to give businesses confidence to reopen and stay open so that people can get back to work”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4299442.1594230490!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"intensive canvassing before paschal donohoe s eurogroup bid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tContenders for the post of president of the Eurogroup: (from left) Luxembourg’s finance minister Pierre Gramegna, Spain’s minister for economic affairs Nadia Calviño  and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. Photograph: Getty ImagesMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will on Thursday seek election to one of the least-known but most influential posts in the EU – president of the Eurogroup, the committee of euro zone finance ministers.Voting takes place during a video conference of the finance ministers, during which the three candidates – Mr Donohoe, Spanish finance minister Nadia Calviño and her Luxembourg counterpart Pierre Gramegna – make their final pitch for votes.Intensive canvassing for the secret ballot has been taking place over recent days, during which Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar both hit the phones to European colleagues and allies, insiders said.There are 19 ministers on the group, meaning the successful candidate needs 10 votes to secure election. If none of the candidates manage to reach that quota on the first round of voting, the candidate with the lowest number of votes will be asked to drop out, leaving the final two to fight it out on the second round.The secret ballot makes it difficult to predict the outcome with any degree of confidence, though Mr Donohoe has the advantage of the backing of the EPP and Irish sources believe he will have the backing of Austria, Cyprus, Latvia, Slovakia and Slovenia, among others.Small countryHowever, Brussels sources point out that his pitch for the job is a bit similar to the Luxembourger Gramegna – a bridge builder from a small country– and it will be crucial to his hopes that he beats Mr Gramegna on the first round and can attract his votes for the second round.Much depends on how France will go, Brussels insiders say. Ms Calviño is seen in some quarters as somewhat isive and Spain already has a top EU job with Josep Borrell, and she also would be similar in profile to the outgoing Mário Centeno as an Iberian social democrat. But some like the idea of a dynamic woman in the role and she has the support of Greece, Italy and Portugal plus Germany.The Netherlands and Belgium have governments in Mr Gramegna’s political grouping, but The Hague would pick Mr Donohoe in a heartbeat if it meant blocking Ms Calviño, it is reckoned in Brussels. While Germany is backing the Spaniard, Dublin hopes that their support will not be sufficiently full-throated to include throwing Germany’s full weight behind her and canvassing on her behalf. Bit like Eurovision“It can be a bit like Eurovision. The Italians and the Portuguese and the Greeks support the Club Med candidate. The small countries support the small country candidate,” said one source close to the process.The power of the role depends on the ability of the person to wield it. The group is seen to have declined in prominence under Mr Centeno, though it was highly influential during the financial crisis when the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem was the group’s head. With the EU seeking to agree a massive funding package to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and stimulate the EU economy, the group is likely to grow in prominence in the months ahead. EU leaders will meet next week in Brussels in a bid to reach agreement on the funding package."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4299560.1594244547!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord docklands d%C3%A1il s lack of drama has tds longing for leinster house","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin arriving at the Convention Centre in Dublin to take Leaders’ Questions at the Dáil session. Photograph: Alan BetsonIt used to be said that the traffic lights outside Dáil Éireann on Kildare Street were the fastest-changing set of lights in the country. When you pressed the button to cross the road, the little green man appeared in the blink of an eye and busy city traffic had to stop so TDs could immediately pass.Yet another good reason to give out about pampered politicians: this time for being far too self-important to wait a short while on the footpath like ordinary mortals everywhere else. It was also a nice little fact to casually throw out to taxi drivers, just to see the steam coming out of their ears.But there was a valid explanation for the hair-trigger traffic lights, and it was to do with ensuring the smooth functioning of our democratic system. Before the modern Leinster House 2000 wing was opened, some TDs had offices across the road in Kildare House. When the ision bells rang summoning them to a vote, they had just six minutes to hightail it across the street to the main building before the ringing stopped and the doors to the Dáil chamber were locked.So the traffic lights were fixed in their favour. These days, they still change quickly for pedestrians, but not as fast as they used to. And the authorities would need to fix an awful lot more than one set of lights to speed the path of today’s TDs as they try to get from their offices in Leinster House to the temporary Dáil chamber across the Liffey in Dublin’s Convention Centre.Not presentAt the Docklands Dáil on Wednesday, for example, a number of listed speakers were not present when the Ceann Comhairle called their names. Later, one of them explained he hadn’t been able to make it over in time from a meeting in Leinster House. From the sanitised confines of their Kildare Street offices, politicians have nothing but praise for the Oireachtas and OPW staff who worked day and night to make the 2,000-seat auditorium and surrounding areas fit for full sittings of a parliament in the time of pandemic. It was no easy task. The parliamentarians know this, but they are not at all happy with the new arrangement. The novelty of a towering modern edifice featuring a stunning glass-walled atrium with a living theatre space repurposed just for them didn’t last very long. A few hours on the first day were enough for most.From a Ceann Comhairle marooned onstage and peering out over a near-deserted house to a Taoiseach swivelling on his heels in a vain attempt to locate the disembodied voice asking him a question from the depths of a balcony, the biggest drama in this theatre is the sheer lack of it. A lot of people have gone to a lot of trouble to make the transition across the river possible, so the politicians don’t want to appear too precious about their riparian predicament. But this week, as last week, they continue to complain about the OTT nature of this temporary Dáil set-up.MutteringsStill, they don’t want to be seen as minimising the threat posed by the Covid-19 virus or stand accused of exposing people who work in Leinster House to unnecessary risk by suggesting the stringent social distancing rules which sparked the relocation be redrawn. There are also mutterings from disgruntled TDs that the plan was driven by senior civil servants in Merrion Street as opposed to the politicians they are obliged to tolerate.Fianna Fáil’s Marc MacSharry was willing to take a stand on Wednesday morning at the start of the debate on the Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill. At the end of his contribution, which am-dram aficionado MacSharry confidently boomed from the very back of the auditorium, the TD for Sligo-Leitrim made some business-related observations on the venue. “I think having the Dáil sit here in the Convention Centre is an abject waste of the taxpayers’ money,” he said, bearing in mind they were debating urgent legislation to fund small businesses affected by the crisis. Addressing the rows of empty seats, he declared: “With some will and just a pinch of imagination we could have a fully functional Oireachtas on the campus where it was intended to be, rather than wasting €25,000 a day down here needlessly.”It is “shameful” they can’t be accommodated in Leinster House “where each of us has our own self-incubation unit with a monitor in front of us to watch proceedings”. All it would take, said MacSharry, is that bit of imagination “and we could all be back up on Kildare Street doing our work as people expect”. Apart from the Ceann Comhairle’s increasingly frustrated squinting around the auditorium to find speakers, two of his vice-chairs were similarly all at sea, with Fianna Fáil’s John Lahart complaining he couldn’t see anybody and Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh complaining that the lights were blinding him.AssiduousLater in the evening, Ó Snodaigh, who is a very assiduous constituency man in Dublin South Central, was one of a handful of TDs selected to raise a matter of concern during the four prized topical issues slots. He was down to ask the Minister (in this case, Minister of State for Special Education and Inclusion Josepha Madigan) about the opening of an ASD Special School in Scoil Colm in Dublin 12. But he didn’t appear. It is most unusual, if not unheard of, for a TD not to turn up when their topic is chosen. We worried Aengus might be laid up at the Eye and Ear after that earlier blinding incident in the chair. However, we checked afterwards and it transpires he was in Leinster House when his speaking slot came up. But this was hours before he was slated to speak (sometime around 9.30pm) and he was called around teatime. Speakers failing to show and the various sessions petering out far earlier than scheduled, forcing the Dáil to adjourn with an entire evening to spare, tells its own story. Compared to the yawning Docklands Dáil, even a sparsely populated Leinster House chamber looks like rush hour at Heuston Station.“What’s so special about us? Look at the way they have been successfully operating in shops and supermarkets,” fumed one TD privately. “If the level of restrictions imposed on us in Leinster House is so critically important, why then are people not dropping like flies in Supervalu and Lidl? Society is starting to function again and the Oireachtas needs to get with the programme.”Looks like economy isn’t the only thing in need of a July stimulus package.

The northern state of Queensland said it would ban non-residents arriving from Victoria. It will open its borders to people from other states and territories on Friday.Even people travelling from Victoria who were willing to pay for the mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine would be banned, the Queensland government said.“They are making the decision that that two weeks and that cost is worth it to get out of Victoria,” deputy premier Stephen Miles said in a televised news conference.“We don’t want that to continue,” he added.The country’s most populous state, New South Wales, closed its heavily trafficked border to neighbouring Victoria on Wednesday. South Australia also closed its border with Victoria.It came as the number of cases worldwide passed 12 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. CataloniaAll residents and visitors in Catalonia must wear face masks in public at all times, becoming the first Spanish region to toughen a national directive mandating their use when in close proximity to others.The order was announced by regional leader Quim Torra four days after more than 200,000 people in the Segria area were placed under a local lockdown following a series of coronavirus outbreaks there.“Masks will be mandatory all over Catalonia, not just in the Segria region... I think it’s an important measure,” Torra told the regional parliament. “We will distribute protective equipment.”Another Spanish region took a similar decision shortly afterwards. Authorities in the Basque Country made masks mandatory regardless of the distance between people in the small town of Ordizia, where another cluster of nearly 50 cases has been detected, said the region’s health counsellor.Spanish authorities last month made wearing masks compulsory indoors and outdoors in all circumstances in which 1.5 metres (5ft) of social distancing could not be maintained, and until a coronavirus cure or vaccine is found.Torra’s order removed that social distancing exception for Catalonia, making masks compulsory in all social situations.The tougher measure aims to stave off a relaxation in attitudes towards the virus observed among some citizens, officials said.Masks will be mandatory in Catalonia for people above six years old outdoors and in any indoors space open to the public regardless of the physical distance between people, regional government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo told a press briefing.Breaking this obligation will result in a €100 fine, she added.The pandemic has hit Spain harder than most other European countries, causing more than 28,000 deaths and close to 270,000 infections, according to official data.In Italy, also badly affected, the same strict mask-wearing rules are in effect until July 14th in regional Covid-19 epicentre Lombardy. Elsewhere in the country, wearing masks is not obligatory outside for those who can keep a safe distance from others.IndiaIndia has reported nearly 25,000 new coronavirus infections as the disease continues to spread through the nation of nearly 1.4 billion people.The virus is showing no signs of slowing in the worst-affected countries — the United States, Brazil and India.The three nations account for more than 60 per cent of new cases, according to recent tallies from Johns Hopkins University.In India, where the death toll has risen above 21,000, research by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai shows that the reproduction rate of the virus ticked up in the first week of July to about 1.2 after it had steadily fallen from a peak of 1.8 in March.The rate needs to be below one for new cases to start falling. Health experts say the true extent of the virus’s spread in India is unknown and that the country must test more given its enormous population.The US reported nearly 59,000 new daily cases, just short of the record 60,000 cases set a day earlier, as President Donald Trump insisted that schools reopen in the autumn.Brazil reported nearly 45,000 new cases.The virus has also been spreading rapidly in South Africa, which reported nearly 9,000 new cases in its latest daily update.A provincial health official said 1.5 million graves are being prepared and it is the public’s responsibility “to make sure that we don’t get there”.In the US, the number of confirmed cases has passed 3 million — meaning nearly one in every 100 people has been confirmed as infected — and the number of deaths is more than 132,000.But Mr Trump remains determined to reopen America’s schools despite worries about the virus, and on Wednesday threatened to hold back federal money if school districts do not bring their students back in the autumn.He complained that his own public health officials’ safety guidelines are impractical and too expensive.JapanTokyo reported more than 220 coronavirus cases on Thursday, a record for a single day, even as officials continued to assert that a state of emergency is not necessary.Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said that increased testing had led to the surge, with authorities encouraging night-time businesses such as host and hostess bars to voluntarily test their staff.Nonetheless, while small in comparison to some global cities, the number came as a shock after the figure had dropped below 100 on Wednesday for the first time in a week. Officials have argued that the recent spike in cases is different from back in April, as the bulk of the infections are from those in their 20s and 30s who are less likely to fall severely ill.New ZealandPolice officers will patrol New Zealand’s quarantine hotels around-the-clock after a number of people – including a man who tested positive for coronavirus – escaped the managed isolation facilities.In two separate incidents in Auckland hotels guests in isolation left their quarantine hotels, with one woman escaping over a hedge, and another man over a small fence.The 32-year-old man – who was away for 70 minutes and visited a busy inner-city supermarket – tested positive for Covid-19. He has since been charged under new public health legislation. He faces a large fine or six months in prison.Government minister Megan Woods said on Thursday “the abscondees are a new phenomenon” and that their carelessness put the health of the whole country at risk. New Zealand has in effect eliminated the virus after a six-week lockdown, with ongoing tight border controls.New arrivals in the country – the majority of whom are New Zealand citizens – have reported growing hostility from New Zealanders, some of whom feel the country’s Covid-free status was being jeopardised.There are 5,648 people in managed isolation and quarantine, and on Thursday a further three new arrivals tested positive for Covid-19. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Health officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Guillermo AriasAFP via GettyAs he campaigned for the presidency, Donald Trump promised to build a “big beautiful wall” along the US-Mexico border, claiming it would keep migrants out of the country and stop everything from drugs to disease.But with Covid-19 cases surging on both sides of the frontier, towns in northern Mexico are pleading to restrict cross-border movement this time to stop tourists and travellers bringing in coronavirus from the US.Over the weekend, townspeople in Sonoyta on the Arizona border used their own vehicles to block the road leading to Puerto Penasco, a beach town on the Sea of Cortes popular with US tourists - and they plan to repeat the process this week.“We invite US tourists not to visit Mexico,” Sonoyta’s mayor, Jose Ramos Arzate, said in a statement. “We agreed on this to safeguard the health of our community in the face of an accelerated rate of Covid-19 contagion in the neighbouring state of Arizona.”Coronavirus cases have mushroomed in several US border states, including Arizona and Texas, which both botched attempts at reopening. Despite the data showing a runaway growth in case figures in the US, Mr Trump has reportedly sought to blame Mexico for the crisis and erroneously claimed Tijuana was “heavily infected with covid”.Mr Trump welcomed Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to the White House on Wednesday, called him a cherished partner and claimed the countries’ economic and security ties were reaching new heights.Mr Trump’s warm words were in stark contrast to the days when he called Mexicans “rapists” and railed against migrants entering the United States illegally.Mr Lopez Obrador had cordial words for Mr Trump, too, saying that while they have disagreed, it was better to find common ground and avoid slinging insults.The meeting was billed as a celebration of economic ties and the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, but critics in Mexico worried Mr Lopez Obrador was being used as a political pawn to bolster the Trump campaign and his “America first”, anti-illegal migration agenda.Despite the verbal backslapping in the Rose Garden, thorny issues, from immigration to investment, remain.Cross-border hindranceMexican states near the border are increasingly coming to see US tourists and the constant cross-border traffic as a hindrance to containment efforts, and have asked the Mexican federal government to impose restrictions.“It’s so important to implement the necessary measures to protect the health of Sonorans. And one of them at this time has to be reducing the border crossings from the United States to Mexico,” Sonora’s health secretary, Enrique Clausen, said earlier this month.Over the weekend, Sonora set up checkpoints to screen people entering from the US, turning back tourists and others whose trips were deemed not be “essential travel”. An exception was made for the border crossing closest to Puerto Penasco, which prompted residents along the route to block the road near the border, Arizona media reported.Other states have also set up health control stations. A “sanitary filter” in Mexicali caused delays of more than eight hours in 40 degree heat across the border in Calexico, California. Officials seized more than 2,000 cans of beer in the process, according to local media, as parts of Mexico have imposed dry laws during the pandemic.The US ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, has urged people to stay put, saying in a US Independence Day message: “In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of people have crossed the land border every day and 90 per cent of them are US citizens or green-card holders. If this traffic doesn’t slow, there will be an increase, not a decrease, in travel restrictions.”Landau previously urged Mexican officials to speed the opening of maquiladoras in the border region, saying continental supply chains could not be stopped indefinitely. The US government has also sent migrants back to Mexico, including people with Covid-19.The US-Mexico border is to remain closed to all but “essential trade and travel” until July 21st. – APEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

It is not just that they require an enormous dose of centralised, government intervention, policies that are anathema to small-statists in ordinary times. An even greater problem is that central planning and huge expansions in welfare are extraordinarily addictive.“Temporary” programmes have a horrible tendency of becoming the new normal, which is why major shocks usually do more to advance socialism than Left-wing election victories or the scribbling of ideologues, as FA Hayek once noted. It is incumbent upon libertarians to help devise workable, politically possible, incremental solutions that allow countries to rediscover economic freedom when a calamity ends.It is hard to undiscover the magic money tree once its existence has been acknowledged the public’s mindset can shift quickly when they begin to enjoy “free money”, and the “losers” from any attempt at unwinding emergency expenditure tend to shout more loudly than the “winners” (in the form of taxpayers). This has plagued and ruined Conservative governments throughout history, forcing many to pursue proto-socialist policies: even before the virus hit, the tax burden in Britain had hit a multi-decade high.Rishi Sunak, to his great credit, understands this. He was forced to spend in a gargantuan way during the first phase of the crisis, insuring the entire economy against the fastest and largest recession in centuries, but he is determined not to allow coronavirus to usher in a permanent Milibandite settlement. He also doesn’t want to fall into the trap of dismissing the scourge of unemployment, as a few Tories once did: the only question is one of means, not ends. Do we want markets to help us out during the next phase of the fight against the virus, or do we want socialism?His speech on Wednesday is best understood as the first stage in his attempt at charting a conservative, freeish-market route out of lockdown, fighting to create jobs in extremely difficult circumstances. He wants to unwind command and control, and replace it with a more bottom-up form of assistance. He is still intervening in an extreme way – any Chancellor would be at this stage – but is trying to shift and time-limit support in a manner that doesn’t attempt to buck market forces.Sunak’s biggest decision was to end furlough in October, rather than delaying it endlessly, as the likes of Spain have done. While he believes in the “nobility of work”, there is no point in giving people “false hope” by propping up doomed jobs forever. Encouragingly, he is no supporter of Franklin D Roosevelt’s economics.Instead of replacing furlough with massive public sector make-work schemes – the apocryphal example involves paying people to uselessly dig holes before filling them up again – he is trying to support the private sector by cutting the cost of employing staff, helping workers retrain and turbocharging the housing market.His Kickstart scheme may or may not work, but it’s better to subsidise getting young people into employment or training than adding them to the public sector payroll. Ditto traineeships and apprenticeships. The danger here is that the unemployment crisis is shifted to older workers.There are also at least two upsides to “eat out to help out”. It will infuriate the authoritarian health fanatics who hate the idea of people enjoying cheap food, while showing that the Tories care about self-made, often immigrant entrepreneurs. It acknowledges that many restaurants will go bust, but empowers consumers to choose which survive. The policy is therefore far more pro-market than simply subsidising all restaurants equally.The same is true of his “green jobs”. If one is going down that route, better to allow consumers to choose their own projects and providers the command and control solution would be for the state to spend everything itself. These “green” jobs are normal jobs, and the beneficiaries – suburban homeowners and double glazing fitters – part of Johnson’s Tory coalition.The question, of course, is what next. Sunak’s Autumn Budget will need to be a blockbuster. It will need to include genuine deregulatory initiatives and further tax cuts. It was reassuring to hear Boris Johnson earlier decrying the opposition’s call for a wealth tax, and the PM’s new slogan contrasting the Tory “jobs, jobs, jobs” to what he described as Labour’s “tax, tax, tax.”As they face a tsunami of economic pain over the next few months, the Tories must remember that no country has ever taxed itself back to full employment. Free markets work collectivism doesn’t.  Sunak\u0027s statement was a good first step his next challenge will be to unleash an entrepreneurial revolution to create the millions of genuine, unsubsidised jobs Britain will be crying out for.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sage sidelined government takes direct control coronavirus response","story":"The Government\u0027s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) appears to have been sidelined as ministers take more direct control of the response to coronavirus.Instead, an expanded Joint Biosecurity Centre will take a more prominent role in co-ordinating the Covid-19 response. Last month, Downing Street appointed a senior spy to lead the unit to monitor the spread of coronavirus, advise ministers on the alert level for the virus and recommend actions to suppress new outbreaks.Now it has emerged that Sage – the committee led by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty – is to meet less often, with its sub-groups asked to provide advice directly to the Government. Scientists expressed concern about the shift, saying the work of the new unit was shrouded in mystery.A member of one of Sage\u0027s sub-committees, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The  it had been mentioned in passing that they would now report directly to ministers. They were told by officials that they had been doing a lot of work, and they were reducing their sitting hours in order to reduce the burden. Scientists in one group were surprised to be told that they would not be meeting at all during August despite the ongoing pandemic.The source questioned what the purpose of Sage would be if the committee no longer had access to evidence from sub-groups which they considered before reporting to the Government.Sage said the working groups would provide advice directly to Government departments and support them more directly, but would not directly report to ministers. Sage meetings have already been reduced from twice to once a week, and in future will occur whenever deemed necessary, sources said. Professor Susan Michie, who sits on both the behavioural science subcommittee, SPI-B, and on Sage, criticised a lack of transparency over the moves, saying the work of the Joint Biosecurity Centre was shrouded in secrecy.In order to get trust, it is really important that there is openness, transparency and explanation of the basis on which advice is given, she told The . We know little about this new body and who is on it.Who are the scientists? What are the criteria used for selecting them? What is the governance and accountability?There are scientists on Sage who work for universities and are independent, but the new body appears to be a Government command and control operation.Prof Michie, a professor of health psychology and director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at UCL, added: I think that this is circumventing Sage.There has been no explanation as to why there is a change in the system – it appears to have been set up without transparency or an explanation of the rationale.Sage had itself been widely criticised for lack of transparency at the start of the crisis, and it took months before the membership of the committee was revealed. However, the scientific advice behind the Government\u0027s strategy has repeatedly come under scrutiny, with concern that it has left Britain too slow in its response and late to adopt policies such as the use of face coverings. On Wednesday, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Sage had given ministers the wrong advice at the start of the crisis by failing to propose a test and trace strategy. Professor Robert Dingwall, a member of the Government\u0027s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which advises Sage, said experience has shown that the present structures are not ideal, although I am not sure that the Joint Biosecurity Centre is the right way to go.He expressed concern that there was little public information about the staffing and working of the new unit, calling for a commitment to transparency in its advice and reports.A Sage member who sits on the SPI-M sub-group said: We need to remember that there was a lot of criticism in March and April about the anonymity of Sage. A senior Government source said the changes had been implemented because the nature of the UK\u0027s response to the pandemic was changing. The source said that while Sage, which is primarily focused on dealing with emerging threats, had played an integral role at the onset of the pandemic, much of the Government\u0027s decision-making was now based on how to manage exiting the lockdown. This meant ministers were increasingly concerned with the testing data being collected by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which is used to identify and monitor local outbreaks. However, the source said Sage would still play an important role in analysing the risks of a second wave of coronavirus and providing advice on winter preparedness. A spokesman for Sage said: Sage will continue to provide a single consensus view of scientific advice at the heart of Government decision-making, to inform the national strategic response to the coronavirus epidemic.As we move into the next phase of the coronavirus response, the JBC will complement the work of Sage, providing more operational focus including data analysis and epidemiological expertise, with the aim of ensuring that outbreaks of coronavirus are detected and brought under control quickly.The committee recommended the creation of the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which was formed in May to help the UK\u0027s chief medical officers set the threat levels in each of the four nations.Last month, Clare Gardiner, the head of cyber resilience and strategy at the National Cyber Security Centre, part of intelligence agency GCHQ, became the centre\u0027s first director-general, responsible for advising ministers on the alert level for the virus.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/07/16/coronavirus-bitcoin.jpg","title":"coronavirus bitcoin price trading south america covid 19 cases venezuela","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027The impact that Covid-19 has had on the cryptocurrency industry is huge,\u0027 analyst saysBitcoin trading has risen significantly in several South American countries currently experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, a study has revealed.Countries including Argentina, Chile and Colombia bucked a trend that saw the volume of bitcoin trading drop globally between 2019 and 2020.Cryptocurrency trades on the LocalBitcoins platform fell by more than a third in total – falling from £537 million to £337m – but rose in volume by nearly a quarter in Chile and more than doubled in Argentina.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData gathered by investment publication Invezz revealed the dramatic impact the coronavirus has had on bitcoin trading.

The NASUWT teachers\u0027 union has asked the government for more information, including over how classroom teaching will carry on in the event of staff absences and what extra support will be available to help schools establish a safe return. Their general secretary said “a significant number of measures” laid out in the guidance for a full reopening in September “require additional resources” in a letter to the education secretary, which urged the government to address the concerns of teachers and school leaders before all students are welcomed back in two months’ time.  Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“How schools will be able to fund these additional expectations is a key question we are being asked,” Dr Patrick Roach said in the letter to Gavin Williamson. As well as mentioning extra funding, NASUWT said teachers and headteachers have also raised questions around protections for clinically vulnerable staff and extra cleaning provisions. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyDr Roach also urged Mr Williamson to address concerns over “the logistical challenge” of getting enough school transport so children from different year groups and schools would not have to mix.He asked the education secretary to design a ”coordinated national plan” for the safe and full reopening of schools in September that addresses the ”many practical and logistical issues” teachers and headteachers have raised.The Department for Education (DfE) said last week “detailed plans” have been released for schools and colleges in England to welcome back all students from September following disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak. Certain year groups, including Year 1 and Year 6, were allowed back from the start of June. Mr Williamson has said it will be “compulsory” for all pupils to go back to school in September.Why Gavin Williamson can’t afford to mess up the reopening of schools“The NASUWT recognises the importance of schools reopening to all children as soon as it is safe to do so,” Dr Roach, the general secretary, said.“Schools have only a few weeks before they close for the summer break,” he added. “Teachers and headteachers need urgent clarification from the DfE if they are to be able to meet the guidance on September reopening consistently and safely.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The education secretary said: “The very best place for children to be is in the classroom, which is why we have set out our plans for all young people to return to education full-time from September.”Mr Williamson added: “I want to reassure parents and families that we are doing everything we can to make sure schools are as safe as possible for children and staff, and will continue to work closely with the country’s best scientific and medical experts to ensure that is the case.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You have it, you have more than enough to keep 100 people going, so why ask the government, take from the government?”Who do people care more about – Kanye West or Donald Trump?Can Kanye West actually run for president?Osbourne continued: “I just don’t get that. When you are so wealthy, your family, everybody in your family is so wealthy, why are you doing this? I think he should give the money back.”West has recently been in the news after announcing that he intends to run for president in the 2020 US elections, although experts have suggested that this could be unlikely.

He had the beard, bare legs, and wasn’t what I would call distractingly attractive.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“This person comes in yelling and screaming, and I thought this must be a scam or a shake-down, so I reported it to the police.

I thought about all the people he previously fooled and I felt good about myself because he didn’t get me.”The Independent has approached Cohen’s representatives for comment.The British comedian is thought to be currently recording a new season of Who Is America and was last week accused of crashing a far-right event and tricking the audience into singing along with racist songs.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To claim universal credit, EU citizens must show they are habitually resident in Britain through the HRT, and in doing so prove their “right to reside”, which depends on factors including work history, whether they have children in school and the circumstances of any partner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe report states the test has “considerable flaws” and imposes “unnecessary hardship” on claimants due to challenges in providing the correct documentation and proving employment in the UK is “genuine and effective”. An analysis of Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) figures by the think tank showed around 45,000 universal credit claims were closed because of HRT failures in the last 12 months of available data. This accounted for about 10 per cent of all those who took the test, around half of whom are estimated to be EU citizens.New universal credit claimants having to skip meals, charities warnEU nationals could be denied UK citizenship by new Home Office tests EU citizens applying for settled status plummets during pandemicThe report states the number of claims will likely have increased “dramatically” due to Covid-19, meaning thousands are likely going without government support and facing unnecessary financial hardship.In one case, a self-employed French citizen working in the creative industries, who has lived in the UK for more than 10 years, lost work in March because of the pandemic. After applying for universal credit, she was called by the jobcentre and asked a series of questions about her work history to determine whether she passed the test. The woman was asked to collect documentation on her income stretching back to 2009, and later told she had failed the test without explanation, only that her income may have been too low to be considered “genuine”.“I was not even aware that it was called the ‘habitual residence test’ until I received the outcome and I was told that I failed it,” she said. “I had no idea what was going on and it wasn’t clear what they were looking for.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailEU nationals who have been in the UK for five years or more can apply for EU settled status – which means they are automatically treated as having a right to reside and, therefore, would not have to pass the HRT when applying for benefits.However, those who have been in the UK for fewer than five years receive pre-settled status, which means they will still need to prove their right to reside as before. How benefit denials could force EU citizens to work through pandemicThe IPPR report also warned that the HRT is “shrouded in secrecy” and that more transparency on the test is “urgently needed” because “very little research” has been conducted into how the test operates in universal credit claims and whether it works as intended.The government has released no statistics on the operation of the HRT in regard to universal credit and has refused numerous requests for information from both the public and MPs on costs grounds. “Given the straightforward nature of some of these questions, this raises serious questions about the government’s ability to monitor the operation of its own policies in this area,” states the report.Marley Morris, the associate director for immigration at the IPPR, said Boris Johnson should “make good on” his words of praise for the contribution of EU citizens during the pandemic and suspend the test for the duration of the immediate economic crisis. This, he said, would “cut bureaucracy at the DWP, relieve the pressures on councils and provide a lifeline for EU citizens who have made the UK their home”.“EU citizens are at the sharp end of this crisis – with many working in vulnerable sectors, such as hospitality and retail, and at serious risk of redundancy,” he added. “Yet the government’s flawed HRT risks barring many from accessing universal credit, leaving them with no safety net as the economic crisis unfolds.”Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the charity had seen some people failing the test despite meeting all the criteria, and others struggling to meet the stringent evidence requirements, with the pandemic having made gathering and submitting this paperwork even harder than usual.“Suspending the HRT for the duration of the crisis is vital for people to get the support they need, especially while large numbers need to claim universal credit to afford food, rent and other essentials, she said.Stephen Timms MP, the chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said: “I welcome this research, which shines an invaluable light on this little known and poorly defined feature of the benefit system. I hope the research will strengthen the case to reform it.”Maike Bohn, the co-founder of the3million, said: “EU citizens have to pass a strict, complex test in an opaque system with little or no easy-to-understand guidance. Erroneous decisions appear plenty and can take a long time to challenge, meanwhile, people are without that vital financial help they need to prevent destitution and homelessness.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Players take a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement on the first day of the first Test cricket match between England and the West Indies at the Ageas Bowl in SouthamptonA circus performer from the Association of Circus Proprietors in Whitehall, London.

The Met Office has predicted the hottest day of the year “This situation has been considerably exacerbated by the pandemic as more people are losing jobs and face destitution. The challenges of isolation and limited contact with advice services also serve to make the situation worse.”A DWP spokesperson said: “This government is committed to supporting people affected by Covid-19 and has implemented an enormous package of measures to do so such as income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional security for renters - which are all open to those with no recourse to public funds - as well as injecting over £6.5bn into the welfare system.“EU citizens who are exercising a qualifying right to reside and are habitually resident in the UK will pass the HRT and can access income-related benefits. EU nationals can also apply to the  Home Office EU settlement scheme to prove their right to reside.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Rishi Sunak has warned that “hardship lies ahead” for many people, as he faced protests from some groups left out of his £30bn rescue package for the economy.The chancellor also risked controversy by claiming it would hurt workers to leave them “just sitting there on furlough”, as he defended axing the job retention scheme in the autumn.“We are not doing those people any favours by not allowing them to get the skills they need to find a new opportunity – just sitting there on furlough forever means their skills fade,” he insisted.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe comment came as the self-employed and freelancers warned of being left without income, while the automotive industry said it was “bitterly disappointed” not to receive extra help.Speaking after his mini-Budget – which unveiled job-saving wage subsidies, a VAT cut for hospitality and tourism and a stamp duty cut – the chancellor acknowledged not everybody would be rescued.Sunak’s rescue plan depends as much on public health as economics“Have we been able to help everyone in exactly the way they would have wanted, I’m sure not,” Mr Sunak admitted, on BBC Breakfast “For that I’m sorry.”And he added: “This has been a period of extreme hardship for many people – and, indeed, hardship lies ahead. This is a difficult time for our economy.”Mr Sunak also admitted some of the £9.4bn cost of the £1,000-a-head bonus to bring back furloughed workers would be wasted, where those staff would have returned anyway.“Without question there will be dead weight,” he said, but argued that was the case for all of the emergency help schemes announced.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: The global gap in education Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The package has been hailed by Conservative MPs, after Mr Sunak also offered a £10-a-head ‘eat out to help out’ discount on restaurant meals next month.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The package unveiled today is expected to cost the Treasury around £30bn.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStamp duty scrapped for homes under £500,000Stamp Duty scrapped on all homes under £500,000 with immediate effectIn an attempt to kickstart the stalled housing market, Mr Sunak is increasing the stamp duty threshold from £125,000 to £500,000 in England and Northern Ireland, taking effect immediately and lasting until March 31 next year.He said this would benefit nine in 10 homebuyers, saving £4,500 on average.“Uncertainty abounds in the market – a market we need to be thriving,” he told MPs.The chancellor said employers that bring back an inidual who was furloughed during the coronavirus lockdown – and continuously employ them until the end of January 2021 – will be paid a £1,000 bonus per employee. He said the bonus scheme would cost £9bn if all employers took full advantage.‘Kickstart scheme’ for young peopleThe new scheme will directly pay employers to create jobs for any 16- to 24-year-olds who are on universal credit, and “at risk of long-term unemployment”, Mr Sunak said. The chancellor insisted these jobs, with a minimum of 25 hours per week, will paid at least the government’s national minimum wage. It is expected that iniduals will be in the first jobs by the autumn, with an initial £2bn set aside for the scheme. “If employers meet these conditions, we will pay young people’s wages for six months, plus an amount to cover overheads,” he told MPs.Meal vouchers for all citizensIn an attempt to get customers back into restaurants, bars and cafes as the lockdown eases, the chancellor announced everyone in the country will be eligible for “Eat Out to Help Out” vouchers. Every diner to get £10 restaurant discount as VAT slashed for hospitalMeals eaten at businesses participating in the scheme, which runs on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays next month, will be 50 per cent off per head, Mr Sunak said.“Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a simple website, open next Monday. Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five days.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A further £1bn will be made available to improve the energy efficiency of public sector buildings, he said.“From September, homeowners and landlords will be able to apply for vouchers to make their homes more energy efficient and create local jobs,” Mr Sunak said. “The grants will cover at least two thirds of the cost, up to £5,000 per household. And for low income households, we’ll go even further with vouchers covering the full cost – up to £10,000.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have two entirely contradictory positions.“If we both dig our heels in on those positions, there will be no discussion or agreement on fisheries and therefore no agreement on trade. That is not what we want.”Lord Norman Lamont has said he is sure the EU will offer Britain a trade deal because the British have insisted there will be no further extension of the transition period.Speaking to Brexit Watch, Lord Lamont said: #Until recently, I thought the negotiations had gone quite badly.#By the word badly, I mean, the likelihood of an agreement was not high.#Personally, I would prefer an agreement to no deal.#But recently Ive detected, perhaps because the British have insisted there will be no extension of the transition period, theres a slight increase in the willingness of the EU to try to reach a deal.#I think the EU is keener now, it has been convinced that Britain is not going to ask for an extension to the extension.#It is anxious to reach a deal itself.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve missed the chance of watching a film in peace - so a day before the big reopening, I booked tickets online.There was limited choice - and nothing new.For now, it’s mainly nostalgic offerings such as Inception and a k restoration of The Empire Strikes Back. Around  films have been available to England’s cinema operators including The Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter and war drama .I scroll through my options which include Back to the Future and Beauty and the Beat and choose Bohemian Rhapsody, a  biological drama about Freddie Mercury which I hadn’t yet got round to seeing.I book and pay for my tickets online - tickets only cost a fiver - and I am encouraged to pre-order and pay for a drink which will be ready when I arrive.When I arrive, there are one way systems in place to follow and there are still manned tills for those who just turn up, though screens have been erected to protect customer’s and staff. Hand-washing stations and antibacterial wipes are everywhere. At no point, am I asked to wear a mask. Public Health England have not made in mandatory given cinemas don’t sit face to face. Signs ‘encourage’ you to wear one, but it’s not enforced. Neither is my temperature checked.I stand in line to collect my drink and then look around to see what food options are in place. You can still buy ice cream, hotdogs, nachos and popcorn - but sadly, there’s no pick ‘n’ mix, it’s self-service nature would clearly put us at risk of cross-contamination. Everything is sold from behind a screen.I’m directed to scan the ticket from my phone myself and am directed up an escalator to screen . It’s the first time cinemas have been opened in months, and it’s only .am, but it’s already bustling with people. Groups of teens and families going to see Paw Patrol.Toilets are open but at reduced capacity. Every other sink and cubicle are sealed off to make sure customers keep their distance. At busy times, you’d probably need to queue.I head into my film and sit in my pre-booked seat. You don’t have to sit by yourselfyou’re attending with members of your household, but must be at least two-metres apart from everyone . I’ve chosen a quiet showing - there are only three others in the auditorium.It’s actually quite nice having fewer people at the screening. There’s no munch crunch of others eating popcorn behind you and for the first time in months, I sit down and enjoy a film in peace.Did I put myself at risk by going  It’s hard to say and the public seem unsure about how safe it is to go right now, though some are clearly willing to take the risk. I felt the industry was doing everything it can to protect those who choose to go, but could these sort of relaxed restrictions lead to us to a second spike  Only time will tell.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No change there then.She pours teasingly slowly before putting the gloriously creamy cold pint on the bar, with the firm instruction: “Hold the glass low down.” It’s to keep your fingers away from your mouth.Back at my booth, I savour the moment.There’s almost a serene, reverential atmosphere as regulars quietly savour their own personal pouring of pub heaven.But as the session progresses beyond lunchtime, gangs of rowdy women start piling in, fresh from the reopened hair salons.It’s GTs and Quarantinis all round and to hell with the one-way system.Within minutes, one of them starts dabbing hand sanitiser behind her ears like it’s Joop. “Ere lads I’m disease free!” No one looks convinced.A worried floor associate starts dishing out urgent advice. But she may as well have said “Don’t drink the hand sanitiser” because it’s only a matter of time before the ladies start shotting it.As more punters pile in and consumption rates start to soar, I finish my drink and take Boris’s advice about not overdoing it.

Coronavirus has hit them hard - under s are two and a half times as likely to work in a sector that has been closed.If the first phase of our economic phase was about protection, and the second phase today is about jobs, there will come a third phase to rebuild. He vowed the Government would heal the wounds of the coronavirus pandemic. The Apprenticeship Levy already incentivises large firms to take on apprentices, but small firms will now also be given a cash bonus for taking them on. The scheme to boost apprentice roles for young people is in addition to plans to get more firms to take on trainees for  weeks -  months by offering them £, for every trainee.

The entire package was part of a three-stage coronavirus economic recovery programme. The first stage - laid out at the start of lockdown - protected jobs and businesses from going under as the country closed up shop. This next stage announced today aims to create a bridge to ensure furloughed workers arent laid off across the country and people who missed out on opportunities were able to find them. Boris Johnsons promise to level up Britain set to be announced in the Autumn budget will form the final stage to help rebuild the nation. Matthew Lesh, Head of Research at the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, welcomed the initiatives to help young people.

They are losing jobs in hospitality and retail and will find it harder to get onto the jobs ladder, risking a long-term loss of income. The Government is rightly focusing on getting young people into real jobs, rather than establishing expensive make-work schemes.

Whatever the reasons, we need to overcome our reservations and wear face coverings whenever we are around others in public.“It used to be quite normal to have quite a few drinks and drive home, and it also used to be normal to drive without seatbelts. Today, both of those would be considered antisocial, and not wearing face coverings in public should be regarded in the same way.”He said the use of masks lowers the chance of future surge and lockdowns which are “economically and psychologically disruptive”.His comments come after new research was released that detailed the effectiveness of the use of face masks and coverings.One study, by the Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicsgroup said masks could reduce the risk of transmission and can also provide benefits to those who wear them.While another paper from the Royal Society’s Science in Emergencies Tasking Covid- group, highlighted how behind the UK was compared to other countries.It claims that in April the uptake of people wearing a mask in the UK was  per cent.It claimed that countries such as Italy had a . per cent uptick, while the US had . per cent and Spain had . per cent.Prof Ramakrishnan said masks need to be treated like any other item of clothing and added that we need to get used to wearing them.Speaking on BBC Radio ’s Today programme this week, he added: I think what we would like for the Government is to be a bit stronger and clearer about the messaging and require it whenever you are in crowded public spaces where you cannot get more than two metres away from the next person.If youre in a crowded setting, you ought to wear a mask.He said outdoors was less of a problem for transmission and that mask-wearing was largely required in indoor settings.Charities have also warned that there are exemptions to the rules and said that not everyone is physically able to wear a mask or covering.The government previously released guides on how to make coverings at home from old t-shirts.Downing Street stressed the need for people to wear face coverings properly, covering both the nose and mouth and a spokesperson for the Prime Minister said a wider roll out is always under reviewWe have been very clear about the benefits of people wearing face coverings.Face coverings can help us protect others and reduce the spread of the viruspeople are infected but not showing symptoms.Highlighting the correct way to wear a mask they added: Covid- is a respiratory disease.

She’s delightful company and easy on the eye. Also, I’m not sure she’s a witch. We could do a drowning test first. Thoughts  PS: I have a pool.”Depp continues the shocking rhetoric, adding: Let’s drown her before we burn her. I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead.”Bettany then replies: “My thoughts entirely. Let’s be certain before we pronounce her a witch.”Grilled about the exchange today, Depp admitted it wasnt the most respectful way to talk about the actress.But he said Heard was very aggressive and quite insulting about my use of alcohol or cocaine.Depp added: She was constantly harping on about things that didn’t exist. She didn’t like me using alcohol or drugs because she had some delusional idea that they turned me into a monster.”He is continuing his evidence after making a string of shocking revelations when he took to the stand yesterday.Among the explosive new claims made in court today was that Depp slapped Heard three times in a drunken rage after she mocked him for his wino forever tattoo.It originally read Winona Forever - but Depp changed it to Wino Forever after he split up with his Edward Scissorhands co-star as it seemed fitting.But he is said to have slapped Heard three times after he had fallen off the wagon following  days sobriety.Sasha Wass QC, representing The Sun, said today: You became frustrated with Ms Heard’s mocking and you slapped Ms Heard across the face in March .“It was the first time you had used violence against her. You slapped her more than once because she didn’t react at first and that made you even more angry.”Depp replied: “It’s not true. It didn’t happen. That is patently untrue.”Ms Wass continued: “It was an outburst of anger on your part and you came to your senses and broke down. You started crying and apologising and said you wouldn’t hit her again.Depp said: “I’m sorry but that’s not the truth. You are mistaken. I did not hit Ms Heard.”The court was also told how Depp was meant to be filming a documentary about The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards the next day when he started snorting more and more lines of cocaine.Heard, who had obviously been crying, and her sister Whitney Henriquez tried for four hours to get Depp to make his way to the set but he refused to leave, it was claimed.Whitney claimed when she arrived at the home the next morning, Depp had been downing whiskey and there was broken glass and cigarette butts littering the floor.The court was read extracts of text messages between the pair after they first started dating in March .One written by Depp reads: Just thought you should know, there exists a book entitled Disco Bloodbath. That is all.Heard replies: We need that book… is it about last Friday night by any chance Depp then asks how she can make him smile at such a hideous moment, before ending the message: I f***ing love you, you c***.Just days before the exchange, Heard claims Depp hit her several times after an argument about a painting by her ex-partner, Tasya van Ree, which was hanging in her bedroom, it was said.He was accused of becoming obsessed with the idea Heard was having an affair with her ex-girlfriend and denied he tried to remove the artwork and set fire to it.His jealousy was referred to again when Depp allegedly trashed a trailer in a drug-fuelled rage when one of Heards pals touched her sexually.Ms Wass said: You started to get angry, the monster joined the party and you took exception to a woman who was in your group called Kelly Sue.You actually became extremely angry with Kelly Sue and became quite unpleasant, shouting at her and eventually saying to her, do you know how much pressure it would take to break your wrist But Depp fired back: I removed Miss Kelly Sues hand from Ms Heards body and told her not to do that.Ms Wass also referred to an incident where Depp held Heards tiny Yorkshire terrier out a car window and began making howling noises.He was said to have later laughed at a running joke about putting the pooch in a microwave.The barrister said: When you were in the car, you were smoking and you opened the window and you were angry and you were aggressive, rather like you were in that clip we saw yesterday - the monster side of your character.And you took hold of Pistol and you held her out of the window and started making howling noises.The actor responded: I can say it is a very endearing image, but it is absolute utter falsity, it is fraudulent.Heard smiled as she arrived for day two of the showdown today after pulling her red bandana down for the waiting photographers.She looked smart in a black belted dress and waved as she made her way up the steps to the entrance of the court.Depp also appeared in a good mood as he beamed at the waiting crowds.The star showed off his many tattoos as he pointed up at the sky before disappearing inside the court for another day of grilling.In an email written by Heard to Depp, which was never sent, Heard told him: I just dont knowI can do this anymore. It is like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Half of you I love madly, and the other half scares me. I cant take him. I wish I could, but I cant.

Despite the Chancellor’s warm words about protecting jobs and livelihoods, his rescue package fell far short of what is required. While the support for the young, unemployed and hospitality and tourism sectors were welcome there was almost nothing for the retail, car and aviation industries. These sectors are already shedding thousands of jobs. What is the Government’s plan when thousands more go when the furlough scheme ends in October  Mr Sunak showed a lack of ambition. His £billion compares poorly with France’s £bn stimulus or the £bn in Germany. A dining voucher scheme available for just  days in August is not sufficient and looks insulting when so many people are struggling. The Chancellor has a warped sense of prioritieshe can find money to subsidise diners but no cash to uprate benefits or give NHS and care workers a much-deserved pay rise. Apologise, PM Boris Johnson has been given several opportunities to apologise for his disgraceful slur on care home workers.Those staff have worked tirelessly through the pandemic, often without the proper kit. They have had to watch vulnerable residents die because of this government’s blunders. The PM should read our account today to appreciate why an apology is so necessary.

One that focussed on jobs and a plan for growth, so we could start to get our economy motoring again. But what we saw didn’t match the scale of the challenge facing the country. For weeks, the government has been promising Britain a ‘New Deal’. But instead we got a Meal Deal. Take the government’s new approach to furlough. The bonus for firms bringing back staff should have been targeted at those who most need the support. Instead, it is being handed over to any business. This potentially puts billions of pounds of taxpayer cash at risk of being wasted. Or take the government’s stamp duty cut. It could have been directed at families looking to get on the housing ladder or up-size. But because what the chancellor announced was so broad, huge chunks of the money will go to landlords and second home owners in the south east and London. At a time of crisis, should this really be the focus  And weaposre still waiting for details of how proposed VAT changes will work and exactly which firms will benefit. Sadly, this is policy-making on the hoof. And it is also policy making to mask failure. The Chancellor himself admitted the other week that the key to getting customers back on the high street is giving people confidence it is safe to do so.  The reason families aren’t going out for meals is not because they are waiting for a tenner off. It’s because the government has botched its public health response. Above all, this is policy-making that isnapost properly aimed at the businesses and people that need it. Again and again, Labour have called for support to be properly targeted, because dferent parts of our economy face very dferent challenges in the months ahead. Again and again, the government has stuck to a one-size fits all approach. one that risks wasting taxpayer money and not providing the most bang for our buck.

It included a aposkickstartapos scheme to get young people into work and a scheme to protect the jobs of people ing from furlough. And there was a discount offer for meals out - as well as a VAT cut aimed at takeaways and attractions. The Chancelloraposs statement included some eye-catching initiatives but are they enough given the scale of the crisis  Here is what he said and the action he could have taken: What he said: “People need to know we will do all we can to give everyone the opportunity of good and secure work. People need to know that although hardship lies ahead, no one will be left without hope.” What is missing: The measures announced by the Chancellor amount to £billion – .% of UK GDP. By contrast France has unveiled a post-Covid stimulus worth €billionand Germany € billion– % of the countryaposs GDP. There was no additional support for the aviation, transport or automotive industries despite the large number of workers they employ. What he said: “Furlough has been a leline for millions, supporting people and businesses to protect jobs. But it cannot and should not go on forever.” “We’re introducing a new policy to reward and incentivise employers who successfully bring furloughed staff back – a new Jobs Retention Bonus.”  What is missing: Everyone accepts the furlough scheme needs to be wound down but Sunak has ignored calls for it to be extended for the sectors such as aviation and retail which have been worst hit by coronavirus. The £, payment for each furloughed worker firms keep on may not workcompanies bank the money for staff they were going to retain anyway and still make others redundant.It also creates a clf-edge when the scheme ends in January for workers in precarious jobs. A cut in National Insurance Contributions may have been more effective. What he said: “The Kickstart Scheme will directly pay employers to create new jobs for any  to -year-old at risk of long-term unemployment.  These will be decent jobs – with a minimum of  hours per week paid at least the National Minimum Wage.”  What is missing: This is a welcome announcement that is modelled on Labouraposs Job Protection Scheme axed by the Tories. The key will be ensuring these are decent jobs and making sure firms do not hire young people on the cheap, while laying off long-serving staff.What he said: “Right now, there is no stamp duty on transactions below £,. Today, I am increasing the threshold to half a million pounds.”  What is missing: Stamp duty cuts have long been a Tory priority but this temporary holiday may have only a limited impact on boosting the economy or helping people onto the housing ladder.The Office for Budget Responsibility has previously noted the main gainers from stamp duty cuts “are people who already own property, not the first-time buyers.”There was nothing in the Chancelloraposs statement on building more social housing or helping renters despite the fact that , tenants face being booted out when the Covid ban on evictions comes to an end on August . What he said: “At the moment, VAT on hospitality and tourism is charged at %.So I’ve decided, for the next six months, to cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions.”  What is missing: The VAT cut will be welcomed by firms who have struggled during lockdown but it does not apply to retail which has been one of the worst hit sectors.Nor was there any support for businesses which remain under lockdown such as gyms, beauty salons, nightclubs, conference centres and bowling alleys.Labour fears that encouraging more people to meet in social gatherings could lead to a further spike in the virus when the Governmentaposs Test and Trace system is still not fully operational. What he said: “To get customers back into restaurants, cafes and pubs, and protect the . million people who work in them I can announce today that, for the month of August, we will give everyone in the country an Eat Out to Help Out discount.”  What is missing: The meal deal will be for just  days in August and will apply to hot food outlets, but not sandwich bars and takeaways.The bigger issue is why the Chancellor thinks it is a priority to help people eat out rather than those who cannot afford to put food on their table.The Trussell Trust, the countryaposs largest foodbank provider, has reported an % increase in demand during the pandemic, while the Office for National Statistics has found .% say they have struggled to pay their bills since the Covid crisis began.

The Yorkshire couple, who visit Cornwall at least once a year, said the sign was the final straw for them.  Kevin told CornwallLive : We’ve noticed a resentment to people going there, and it’s been building up in the last few years.Recently we hadn’t felt as comfortable in Cornwall, the attitude towards visitors is now extremely poor. “At best, it was a feeling of tolerance rather than welcome. It’s just not the same as what it was, we’ve felt that change.” The sign was held up as as the county welcomed holidaymakers back for the first time since the hospitality industry was shut down by the Covid- lockdown.

Stacey Matthews, , mistook her cancer for a bad back caused by her mattress - and brushed off her worries. The Blackpool mum eventually plucked up the courage to go to hospital, where an MRI scan revealed the cancer had spread to her left lung, liver, groin and spine. Further investigations also revealed Stacey had a lump in her left breast. Stacey started chemotherapy immediately in a bid to prolong her le, but after two rounds she was given the devastating news it was too late for the treatment to work and she has just weeks to live. Heartbroken at the thought of not making it to December, Stacey told family members she wanted just one last Christmas with her children Caitlan, , Byron, , Chardanai, , and Lilly, six. Local charity The Albert Project, founded by Wayne Sanderson, heard about Staceyaposs last wish and got to work immediately. They sourced donations of presents, Christmas decorations, a turkey, pigs in blankets, Christmas crackers and games from Morrisons supermarket. Other locals and businesses rallied around to give Staceyaposs last Christmas one to remember - decorating the house with lights, tinsel, and Christmas trees.  Staceyaposs four children had no idea about the plans until they arrived home to find the house transformed into a Christmas grotto and presents piled up in the living room. Full-time mum Stacey said: When the consultant told me the chemotherapy wasnapost working and I didnapost have long left, the first thing I thought about was Christmas. Christmas is a big deal in our house, having four children means itaposs always a day filled with so much happiness, and I knew I just wanted one more Christmas Day with the kids - evenitaposs in the middle of summer. My family appealed to the Albert Project and within a matter of days we were sent presents, decorations, cakes and sweets. It was just overwhelming. Iaposve been honest with the children about my diagnosis. They know I havenapost got long left and we have had some sad days, but weaposre trying to make every day a happy day from now on. I want them to have happy memories of our last few weeks together.  Seeing the kidsapos faces when they came home and found Christmas Day in the middle of summer is something I will never forget. The look on their faces was amazing, but it was very emotional at times too. At one point Lilly asked why we were having Christmas Day, and I had to tell her it was because mummy didnapost have long left and I might not be here at Christmas. It was so hard having to tell her again and the realisation hitting me. We cried a lot. Despite suffering from back pain for weeks, Stacey never thought it was anything serious and was reluctant to visit the hospital due to the virus epidemic.Stacey said: I had back pain for weeks, but I was worried about going to hospital because of coronavirus.I didnapost think it was anything serious at first, I just put it down to my bed or my mattress. I thought I might be sleeping funny, or I thought it might be something to do with my periods, but it turned out the cancer had basically crushed my spine. Iaposd also been sick quite a lot, I couldnapost keep anything down and I lost about a stone in weight, but I didnapost put two and two together. I thought I just had a stomach bug. The thought of cancer didnapost cross my mind.

Gemma Hart, , might be self-taught but when she baked an incredible Heinz baked beans tin for her th wedding anniversary with hubby Chris, , daughter Lilia, eight, asked for a slice aposwithout the bean juiceapos. The mum-of-two spent eight hours baking and icing the iconic food container, which was a cherry bakewell-flavoured cake, using inidual bits of icing for the beans. To ensure her little slice of heaven looked as realistic as possible, Gemma - who runs From the Hart Cake Creations - used piping gel and a little food colouring for the controversial sauce. Gemma, from Renishaw, Derbys, said: Theyaposre so realistic, so it can still trick your mind a bit. I got some aposbean juiceapos on my finger and instinctively went to lick it off but stopped because I instinctively thought aposewapos. In reality it was just piping gel with some food colouring in it. Even Lilia asked for a slice without the juice part because she didnapost want that. The beans were made out of inidual icing and then they were airbrushed. Fortunately it was a cherry bakewell cake so it didnapost taste like beans. I made the baked bean cake to celebrate me and Chris being married for  years. Your tenth anniversary is tin, which I thought was a bit rubbish, so I decided to try something a bit funny. Gemma started baking when her eldest daughter, Melody, , was born as she wanted to make birthday cakes for her own children. At first it was only a hobby, but once other mums saw her designs for her own children they asked her to make cakes for them and four years ago Gemma went full time. Aside from making the usual wedding cakes and superhero cakes for kidsapos birthdays, Gemma has made some mind-bending bakes for special occasions. Gemma said: I made a chicken nugget cake for my niece because she was a fussy eater and they were all she would eat, so that was a bit of a running joke. I made a chicken sandwich for a mum in my daughteraposs school as her son had been missing McDonaldaposs so much during lockdown she asked for that for him. I do love doing something dferent. I really enjoy it when commissions give you some room to work with. Itaposs nice to have more artistic license, especially when you get an illusion from it.  The baked beans cake took eight hours in total, it was pretty straight forward. The reaction to it has been fantastic. I had one lady message me saying she thought I was going to cut my finger on the lid of the tin because it looked so realistic. When you see stuff as often as I do, you just get used to things not looking like they do. Itaposs been fantastic getting that reaction though.

Convicted child abuser Richard Cumberland was said to have aposrejoicedapos in his warped desires when he shared them in chatrooms with other sexual deviants. A court heard the sinister plan to ply two girls with sleeping pills or alcohol before raping at least one of them was instigated after the childrenaposs father posted photos of them being abused. The two men, who later met up for sex with each other, even discussed where to buy the drugs, and then aposnegotiated the going rateapos in terms of the childaposs aposrewardapos for their ordeal. Cumberland also shared the same indecent images of the girls, as well as ones of other unknown children, with fellow paedophiles. They then engaged in aposgrotesque and celebratoryapos conversations, with the -year-old boasting - untruthfully - about having a pregnant girlfriend, saying he would have his own child aposto play withapos and would aposlove to have a go at a babyapos. At one stage in the legal proceedings, a shocked Judge Julian Smith was heard to exclaim aposGood Lordapos on learning the detail of one horric abuse video shared among the perverts online. The explicit chatlogs came to light in , four years after Cumberland had been jailed for a year for causing or inciting a child under  to engage in sexual activity, and possessing indecent images of children. However, he was released by Kent Police under investigation and it was not until February  when he sent images of his penis to an undercover officer posing as a -year-old boy that he was re-arrested and charged. Cumberland subsequently admitted arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, breach of a sexual offences prevention order, attempting to sexually communicate with a child, and  offences of distributing indecent images of a child. Jailing him on Tuesday at Maidstone Crown Court, Kent, Judge Smith said he aposnegotiatedapos his planned abuse of the girls with their father, and then aposshowed off and rejoicedapos with other paedophiles that they were to be his victims. He concluded that Cumberland posed such a danger that he will have to serve at least two-thirds of his prison term rather than being released automatically at the halfway stage.  Under what is known as an extended sentence, he will also have a further four years added to any time spent on licence. Cumberland, now living in Caersws in Powys, Wales, denied a further eight distribution charges which were ordered by the judge to be left on file. He told the paedophile: This was not idle chat, it was not spontaneous or mere fantastical discussions. These girls were real and you were involved in planning their rape with their father. The contents of the chatlogs with those of a like mind are deeply disturbing and speak in the most graphic terms of what you and they were looking for. You shared images of these young girls expressing your wish, your hope and your expectation that you would be able to abuse them with their fatheraposs permission. Your intentions were very clear, very graphic and vile. You were rejoicing in the fact they were to be your victims. The court heard that the plot with the childrenaposs father was hatched after he sent Cumberland images of them being abused via a chatroom conversation. The man articulated the sexual act he had performed on his daughter and sent images, said prosecutor Rio Pahlavanpour. Attempts were then made to meet up. There was talk of the victims being drugged or given alcohol. The defendant even asked what type of drugs and whether they could be obtained from Boots. He was quite clear as to what acts he wanted to perform. The chatlogs between Cumberland and other paedophiles included references to wanting to rape a young boy and a baby, which Cumberland said would be aposso goodapos.

Venetia Murrayaposs brotheraposs will, which was lost for two decades, was discovered when the cat bumped into documents in her lawyeraposs office. The feline had perfect timing - as the papers that would ultimately bring a decades-long family feud to an end were among a pile destined for a date with a shredder. The long-running legal battle began with a squabble over the siblingsapos late grandfatheraposs £million Hertfordshire farm. Dean Brunt, his brother Dale and sister Venetia, , had between them owned Ettridge Farm. When Dean died in a railway accident in  aged just  a row was sparked over the ownership of the property. Dean was thought to have died without making a will, so his £millon share of the farm went to his -year-old mum. Marlene Brunt in turn handed it to her eldest child, Dale, . But after Venetia discovered the existence of two wills made by her brother in , a family feud was sparked. Venetia and her uncle Bob Wrangle took up arms against Dale and the siblingsapos mum. One of the wills formed crucial evidence of Deanaposs intention to give his sister half his wealth, according to lawyers. But it was unearthed when a solicitoraposs cat knocked over a pile of papers which were about to be shredded. At the High Court in London this week, Judge Paul Teverson this week rejected claims by Dale and his mum that the wills were forged. Judge Teverson ruled that Venetia will get half of Deanaposs share of the farm.  The court heard that the three siblings inherited the farm, at Broxbourne, from their grandfather Arthur Nicholls, who had bought it with his earnings as a prize fighter. He died in . Arthur was Deanaposs hero and it was his grandfather who persuaded him to train as mechanic. Deanaposs own father, a jockey and racehorse trainer, played no part in his upbringing, the judge said. Dean, who the judge said was the gentler of the two brothers, had been starved of oxygen at birth and was thought to have suffered from learning dficulties and mental health issues in later le. A coroner ed an accidental death verdict after his body was found on a railway line near Sawbridgeworth, Herts, in . Following his death, his mum Marlene obtained letters of administration over his estate on the basis that he had died an intestate batchelor, without having made a valid will and with no children of his own.  She inherited his share of the farm and passed on that share to Dale, meaning he then owned two thirds of the land and business, which is estimated to be worth £m, and Venetia the rest. But the family fell out, with Venetia, who lives in a house on the family land, accusing her brother Dale of bullying her out of running the business and treating their -year-old uncle Winston aposBobapos Wrangle badly by trying to force him from his home, which is also on the farm. Venetia told the court she had assumed that, after Deanaposs death, she and Dale were joint owners of the farm and business partnership. And she was shocked when, nearly a decade later, her mum revealed that it was she who inherited Deanaposs share because he had not made a will, and then given it all to Dale. Then in , Deanaposs former legal adviser Howard Day discovered what he said was Deanaposs final will among his files, which backed Venetiaaposs claim to half the £m. Mr Wrangle, who helped bring up Venetia and was close to the family, took the case to court after the discovery of the will signed on Deanaposs behalf by Mr Day.  Dale and Marlene claimed that document was a forgery, made after Deanaposs death. Mr Day died last year before the issue could be settled. But the court heard that in February this year a second will in the same terms was unwittingly discovered by the solicitoraposs cat among the pile of Mr Dayaposs documents waiting to be shredded. Barrister Duncan Macpherson, for Mr Wrangle, told how the crucial second will was discovered following Mr Dayaposs death and only weeks before the case was due in court. Papers relating to disputes within the family had been sent from Mr Dayaposs office to the office of Mr Wrangleaposs solicitor, Katy Sillett, in London. Mrs Sillett was organising the papers and had piled up un-needed duplicate copies ready to be destroyed, Mr Macpherson told the judge. Her cat knocked over the papers for shredding, he continued.  When Mrs Sillett picked them up, she realised that what she believed was a duplicate will was in fact an original. Mr Macpherson said it was agreed that the second will was written at the same time as the first and so it was crucial evidence in support of the authenticity of both. It had a more steady-handed signature than the other document, which weakened claims from Dale and his mum that they were forgeries. Under the two identical wills, Dale and Venetia would share Deanaposs £m slice of the farm, rather than Dale taking it all as he ultimately wouldhis brother had died intestate. However, Dale and his mum claimed that the documents, both dated , were not valid and that they suspected they had actually been made years later after Deanaposs death. Mr Day had signed the wills on Deanaposs behalf, the court was told, but the signature on the first document to be found was unsteady. That suggested that it had been signed years later when Mr Day was less firm. Although experts said there was evidence both may have been written later, the signature on the second document found due to the cat was more steady-handed and more similar to examples of Mr Dayaposs signature of the late s. Ruling in favour of the wills, Judge Teverson said there was a substantial amount of evidence that Dean had talked in the late s about having made a will. He had told friends he had done what his grandfather would have wanted, leaving his share of the farm to his brother and sister, with his mum getting nothing. And the judge rejected the suggestions that Mr Dayaposs notes of the time when the wills were made were part of an elaborate fraud. The judge said he had no doubt but that Mr Wrangle genuinely believes Dean left behind a will and said Venetia was an impressive witness who had been genuinely shocked to learn she had not inherited Deanaposs share of the farm. I do not think she would for one moment associate herself with a fraudulent claim, he said. However, Dale appeared to be intent principally on arguing his and Marleneaposs case and his mother was a most unimpressive witness, he continued. She and Dale had deliberately kept Venetia and Mr Wrangle in the dark about Dean having died intestate and his share having gone to Dale, he found. I heard and saw Marlene give evidence. She denied ever having seen the will when a copy of it was shown to her. Her evidence then shted to saying that the document was Howardaposs will and not Deanaposs will. The court must have sympathy for and respect her grief at the loss of her son. That cannot however justy concealing from her family apart from Dale that Deanaposs estate was being administered under intestacy, which I find that she did. He said the most likely explanation was that Marlene knew there was a will, but chose not to reveal it after her sonaposs death because she thought it was not Deanaposs will but a will done by Howard Day.

The cruel vandal pretended to have an autistic child in order to book a family room at Fabb Scotland at the weekend. The facility - which gives a vital leline for struggling families - allows disabled kids to participate in social and educational activities outdoors. It is believed that  people turned up and destroyed the bedroom on Saturday night, the Daily Record reports. Shocked workers discovered human excrement and vomit on the floor, and mattresses soaked in urine. The vandals also ripped a radiator and a HD TV off the wall, tore down curtains and rails and left the toilets broken. The boozed-up louts also went on a rampage around the Trossachs Tryst site and tried to break into the main building. Their trail of destruction was marked by mountains of empty beer, spirit and wine bottles left behind. Police have since launched a probe into the vandalism after officers were called out.A statement on the Fabb Followersapos Facebook page said: We at Fabb were devastated to find one of our recently refurbished family rooms in Callander trashed by visitors at the weekend. After booking under the  pretence of a family with an autistic child looking for a break a group of more than  people turned up leaving the roomin a mess! Staff members were in tears when they were then faced with cleaning human faeces from the floor, scrubbing sick from the carpets and removing urine soaked mattresses. Never in all the years of running residential weekends have we been faced with such blatant disrespect and contempt for our charity and beloved building which gives such joy to so many young people and their families. Fiona Hird, CEO of Fabb Scotland told the Daily Record staff havenapost been able to properly access the flat. The room has to be left untouched for  hours because of coronavirus fears.Ms Hird added: What should have been our first let to a carer over the weekend has left us disappointed that someone would lie in such a way. We now have to replace the carpets, bed covers and will need to install a new curtain rail and toilet. The wigwam at the back of the property, which is used by visiting children, was also totally vandalised.

Asked about next weekaposs weather, a Met Office spokesman told theyesterday : On the whole, England and Wales is looking largely settled, with temperatures in the mid-s in the sunshine.But emphasised: It is too early to tellit will be a heatwave. Itaposs been a topsy-turvy summer so far, to say the least, and the rest of this week is no dferent, with heavy thundery rain predicted, as Tropical Storm Edouard finally arrives.  BBC forecaster Helen Willetts said of Thursday: Underneath all this cloud and rain, itaposs mild, itaposs really quite humid out there for most of us. Heavy overnight rain will leave a legacy of a dull and drizzly weather, she added. It wonapost be raining all day...thereaposll be some drier spells in between and itaposs quite warm...at  or  degrees, but not much brightness.  By Thursday afternoon, particularly in Scotland, thereaposll be some heavy slow-moving showers...thereaposs little wind to move them on and they could turn thundery, she added. Netweather weather charts show temperatures hitting C between next Sunday and July  but the forecaster has also indicated C is possible.

The young boy claims heaposs been seeing a strange lady in his room each night - and she makes a rather bizarre request.The childaposs grandma is so concerned about the tales of the ghostly figure that sheaposs even written into an advice column for some help on what to do next. In a letter to slateaposs Dear Care and Feeding, titled My Grandson Is Visited by a Spooky Lady Every Night, the unnamed woman explained all and we have to admit, the whole thing does sound like something from a scary movie.She wrote: My .-year-old grandson has been having a recurring nightmare for the past week and a half. He wakes up very upset saying there is a lady in his room. When askedshe talks to him and why he thinks she is there, he says that she has to get something from his room, and she wants to put something on his foot. He is afraid to go to bed. My daughter is in the process of potty training him, and he also has a new sister . I know that these le changes can cause children to have nightmares, and I understand that imagination is vivid at this age. However, this just seems so specic and kind of creepy. She adds that the family are at a loss over how to handle the situation. The agony aunt replies, stating that a week and a half isnapost a tremendously long period of time for a recurring nightmare, so the family should see how it goes for a while and possibly put the breaks on potty training for now. Additionally, the writer suggests trying all the common nightmare remedies - such as sleeping with a night light and using a weird lady spray that renders any weird ladies harmless. If all  fails, they recommend buying a nanny cam so we can all see the ghost.

I didn’t know him. Was I walking funny  Did he know something I didn’t  “Your Tele column,” he explained. “A couple of weeks ago. You said you’d put your back out.”Well Dave,you’re reading this, it’s four-and-a-half years on and I’ve done it again.Dave was full of sympathy because he is one of the estimated % of people who suffer with lower back pain, while it’s thought one in three of us have had to take time off work because of back and neck problems.There I was, waking as normal on Friday morning. I sat at the kitchen table with my coffee and stood up and it went. And when I say “went” I couldn’t move.I asked my eldest, who is seven, to call his dad on my phone as I clung to the the kitchen units unable to straighten up.Thankfullyit only seems to happen every few years. I often hear people say they “put their back out” but still manage to shop or jog carefully – but for me it means not being able to move.The last time a debilitating pang struckwas as I was lting one of the boys in his car seat to the car while living on the Perth Road.“Help” I screamed at a passing man who looked more terried than me “I can’t move. My back!”As one baby rested on the pavement in his seat, the then-toddler had run away into someone’s garden and I begged the man to catch him. He obliged but clearly thought I was deranged.Back to Friday.Jamie rushed home while I went to lie down. It’s true what they say – trying at least to do back exercises and walk seems to be better than taking to your bed for days, though the chance would be a fine thing.After a bit, Jamie had to make a few calls so I edged down to sit at the table again. You know that game “here comes the aeroplane” to encourage wee ones to eat up  Well, my youngest who is three, decided to turn the tables and wave his pasta around my face.Flinching with pain, I turned to him and tried to smile – just in time to be forked in the eye.Back pain is relatable, many of you will have your own stories of woe – I’m giving you a virtual pat on the back here in sympathy.Being forked in the eye is probably a more niche ailment. Thankfully it was a baby fork but still, the pain was very real.Friday started out just like any morning. By lunchtime I could barely see or walk.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances. Every penny needed to keep these two lesavers in the air seven days a week,  days a year, is donated by the people of Scotland. We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 12 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe selfish and reckless behaviour of many people visiting Argyll is to be deplored.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt.

As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits.

This means that, under current rules, only members of the same household or extended household group are permitted to stay away from home together.The previous five mile travel distance limit for leisure has been lted, though the public are still being encouraged to stay within their local area where possible.Self-contained self-catering holiday accommodation across Scotland has also begun to reopen for bookings, including a iety of businesses such as caravan parks and camping sites.

The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next.

Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown.

The inquisitorial question, ldquoAre you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party, has gone down in history as a chilling expression and reminder of the dangers of right-wing political panics.Today, we find the so-called left, in the form of Rebecca Long Bailey, being sacked, McCarthy style, by Labour leader Keir Starmer, for daring to retweet a newspaper interview with the actor Maxine Peake that had in it a crass and inaccurate reference to Israeli security forces training US police to use the kneeling tactics which killed George Floyd.The irony, of course, is that this sacking does not come with rants about communist atheism, a defence of Christian mortality, ideas of treachery or the lack of loyalty to the nation. It is not a right-wing sacking but an all too familiar ldquoprogressive sacking.It is unlikely that Starmer thinks Long Bailey is actually anti-Semitic and many have suggested this is an opportunistic move on the Labour leaderrsquos behalf to clear out some of the Corbyn supporters in his shadow cabinet. The problem being, of course, that in so doing he is simply applying the modern McCarthyite approach that has been developed by the ldquoleft when dealing with those with whom they disagree.McCarthy and his ilk hated the liberal and left-wing progressives that they saw as dominating the entertainment industry, the luvvies who transgressed from American patriotism and Christian morality. Today, this too has changed, and it is often the cultural elite, the left-luvvies, who are the most ldquoright-thinking, censorious and keen to demand that people be ldquocancelled.Just ask Lawrence Fox, the actor who has been blacklisted for questioning the idea of ldquowhite privilege. Fox fears he may never get another acting job he may well be right.Until relatively recently it was only the most small-minded of bigots who thought it acceptable to sack people because of their ldquoimmoral opinions.

It may be that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has also become a devotee of this theory, which says governments can spend public money without having to worry about debt.He is in the hole for pound billion because of Covid and has seen the UK debt pile rise to nearly pound trillion. He borrowed a record poundbn in April alone. But he doesnrsquot sound all that worried and will be adding to it today in his summer statement.Modern monetarists believe that the traditional view of government finance ndash that it has to raise tax revenue to pay for services like the NHS ndash is wrong. Governments can spend on anything they want by printing money or borrowing. Just think of a number, print it and yoursquore off to the races. Rodger Malcolm Mitchellrsquos MMT book Free Money sums it up.So whatBritainrsquos debt has rocketed to more than  per cent of GDP  Doesnrsquot matter. Japan has public debt of % of GDP and seems to be surviving. An independent Scotland shouldnrsquot bother about debt either, so long as it has control of its currency, because it can just print Scottish pounds to pay for it.It sounds crazy, like Zimbabwean economics. And ultimately Modern Monetary Theory is a reductio ad absurdam. Fiat money has no intrinsic value soyou just increase the volume of it, without generating equivalent wealth, then its value will tend to reduce to nothing ndash as in Weimar Germany where people needed wheelbarr,ows to collect wages.However, there is method to MMT madness. It contains an important kernel of truth: that government spending, given low inflation, does not need to be financed by tax revenue.The traditional Thatcherite view, that you can only spend what you can afford, is back to front. If the state spends to get the economy moving in a recession the debt effectively finances itself by generating future taxation from the people newly employed.This was what John Maynard Keynes ndash really the grandfather of MMT ndash argued during the Great Depression. If governments spend money on, say, arms production the people employed in these factories go on to pay for goods and services from where in the private sector ndash food, clothing, housing and so on. This creates more private sector jobs through the so-called ldquomultiplier effect.Thus, a pound spent by the government generates more pounds in future by stimulating economic activity. So long as there is less than full employment governments should spend whatever it takes to get the economy running at full capacity. They could even pay people to dig holes and fill them in again.Yes, itrsquos a kind of free lunch argument and has been much criticised by conventional economists ndash including the European Central Bank - who believe excessive government spending debases the currency, distorts the market and leads to financial collapse, Greek style. Environmentalists donrsquot like the emphasis on growth.What has made Keynsianism, or MMT, so plausible recently is that many central banks have been printing money like therersquos no tomorrow since  and so far prices have remained stable and the roof has not fallen in. In the UK, the Bank of England has created an astonishing poundbn through Quantitative Easing ndash buying government debt.Conservatives like Boris Johnson, hardly radical leftists, are increasingly seeing debt as a good thing ndash or at any rate nothing to worry about. In order to keep his ldquored wall gains intact, Mr Johnson has promised to ldquobuild, build, build.Right now, interest rates are near zero, so there seems little reason to forgo spending. And thatrsquos precisely what Mr Sunak has been doing. In sheer volume terms he has spent more rapidly than any government in British history, mostly paying for furloughed employees.Paying private sector wages goes beyond what Modern Monetary Theorists advocate. It is more in the style of old-fashioned Marxists who wanted the state to take over the economy entirely. MMTers donrsquot want to nationalise the means of production.Of course, common sense says public spending canrsquot increase indefinitely. What about the interest on government debt  Surely that has to be paid. The UK currently spends poundbn a year on debt interest ndash more than on defence.Modern monetarists like Richard Murphy say the government should simply print more money to pay this, which it can do up to a point. However most government debt is owned by private pension funds and institutional investors or by foreign banks and financiers. In the long term,the government paid its debts in worthless printed pounds, theyrsquod soon stop lending.ldquoBut in the long run, said Keynes, ldquowersquore all dead. The Bank of England has printed hundreds of billions in QE since  and financiers are still falling over themselves to lend. Indeed, theyrsquore effectively lending at zero interest and getting nothing for their money.Mr Sunak will promise that Britainrsquos debts will be paid ndash he has to say that because free money sounds irresponsible. But he is likely to keep borrowing and spending because it is politically the sensible thing to do avert a Covid depression.People on the left are puzzled by this. Why is a Tory politician adopting the economics of Bernie Sanders  Well, it might be worth mentioning that one of the main founders of MMT was a hedge fund manager and tax exile, Warren Mosler, in the s. MMT is not a particularly left wing idea, nor is public debt.The former Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, said in  that ldquodeficits donrsquot matter. Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan and George Bush massively increased US public debt. It has been Democrats like Barak Obama and Bill Clinton who have sweated to reduce deficits.Donald Trump has ramped up more debt than any US government in history,  trillion, and is about to borrow trillion more.

He has said he believes fans are the reason why no current professionals have come out as gay.He became the first male English footballer to come out since Justin Fashanu in . Mr Fashanu came out while still playing top flight professional football in the US. He would laterto the UK to play for Torquay United, Airdrie and Hearts.Justin FashanuOther international players such as Robbie Rogers and Thomas Hitzlsperger only came out after retiring from British football.In stark contrast to the menrsquos game, womens football has many role models.

It is that footballers are frightened. It is fear that stops them from coming out.\"I have a friend who is an agent and he told me the first gay footballer would make an absolute fortune because big companies would want to be associated with the first footballer to come out. Financially it would be very lucrative for that footballer.\"I suspect it is the fear that they are going to be harassed online and they might not feel safe walking in the street in certain communities and that they would have a target on their back as the first person to person to come out.\"That really is shocking in the st century.\"What seems to me, speaking as a gay man myself, is that footballers are in an enormously privileged position. The high profile ones are very wealthy, they can protect themselves from immediate physical danger. Andthey are too scared to come out, what does that say to kids living up and down the country, who look at them and say thathe doesnt feel safe coming out, what hope is there for me in my housing scheme, or estate. That is the real worry about this.Magdalena Eriksson\"I feel we have been talking about this for years.

I dont recognise a concern about this.:Mark Smith -I know there are gay footballers in Scotland because I tried to convince one to go public\"There is some concern but it doesnt seem to be a pressing concern.\"The SNP MP said that Richard Masters, chief executive of the English Premier League had told MPs that footballers that came out would be embraced by the game which he said was a far more welcoming place in . But he also conceded that it was a failure in the game that a player had not felt able to do so.But Mr Nicolson said: \"I dont have any sense at all that it is a far more welcoming place. By definition,it was a far more welcoming place, people would feel free to come out.\"His commentary came in a discussion with Paul Cleal, an adviser to several relevant organisations including the Premier League who told him that mens football was \"not welcoming enough\".He believed football was more concerned about behaviour of people in the stadia and social media, which he said was \"a shame\".A spokesman for the FA the governing body of football in England said: \"Coming out, irrespective of gender, is an inidual and personal decision. Having a support network and allies, whether thatrsquos teammates, friends or family, can be crucial in this process and we will always offer the full support of The FA to anybody that chooses to come out.\"We continue to work with our partners across the game, such as Stonewall, LGBT fan groups, campaign groups and the leagues, to help create a safe and comfortable environment for any player to come outthey wish to do so.

We will remember the Thursday clap, of course, but thatrsquos merely the symbolism for what lies beneath. There was never a question ofdoctors, nurses and other hospital staff would work, but how they should work, and how they should protect vulnerable, shielding colleagues unable to work. Wersquoll remember the less high-profile key workers, too. The shop workers, the waste collectors, delivery drivers and the other emergency services.For better or worse, we will remember the political leaders. Some will want to write a history scarred by their poor performance, whilst some will want to remember them as statespeople, but thatrsquos politics. We may even spare a thought, when we look back, for the parents who tried to care for and educate their children at the same time as working, running businesses, trying to keep their families mentally, physically and financially afloat.How, though, decades from now, will people remember what our teachers did during coronavirus It is dficult, and I suppose unfair, to single out any particular public service worker as being the most important to our country. ButI was forced to do so, Irsquod pick teachers every time. Of all the services we pay our taxes to receive, the education of children tops the list.Having good teachers in good schools works hand-in-hand with parenting in dictating not only our own personal success, but with it our contribution to the social and economic future of our country. Our own moulding is then passed to our children, and so it goes on.So, for me, teaching is the single most important service that society provides, and that makes teachers the single most important group of public servants we have.Behind all the lazy labelsis a profession which works hard and often long hours for a salary which, whilst much better in recent years, remains relatively low given the relationship between good teaching and national success.They are heroes. And when the movies are made and the books are written they, I suspect in large majority, deserve to be remembered as playing a hero role during coronavirus. The teachers who, knowing the damage that lockdown was doing to the most vulnerable, spent their weeks delivering essentials to kids at their homes. The teachers who waded through the official guidance to make sure they could talk to their pupils over video, whether as a one-to-one chat or for a video lesson. The teachers who put in more time than they ordinarily would have to create, then review and mark detailed lesson plans for children to complete at home.Inidual stories of hero teachers, scattered all across the country. Small acts, making a big dference.I fear, though, that these inidual heroes will not shape the nationrsquos memories of the performance and attitude of the profession as a whole. For the inidual heroes are not the people with the voice. The voice belongs to their representation, dominated by the grandly named Educational Institute of Scotland , which the lay person knows simply as the teacherrsquos trade union.A s trade union trapped in the s, the EIS appears to see its job as to simply say no. No to a nineper cent pay rise, with a recommendation of strike action. No to John Swinneyrsquos school reform plans, despite them being designed to give more power to teachers themselves.And now, it seems, placing hurdles in front of the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans for children toto school full-time next month. This is a union which, it seems, feels free to flex its muscle and expects the government to kiss its feet. The most ludicrous example of this is the apparent determination of the unionrsquos leader, Larry Flanagan, to reject guidance from scientists and epidemiologists on social distancing. Mr Flanagan told the Sunday Times last month that the World Health Organisationhad made a ldquomistake to recommend a one-metre social distance. Itrsquos rather like the WHO telling Scotlandrsquos teachers that they donrsquot believe in cursive writing. Teachers would say ldquowhatrsquos that got to do with you , and theyrsquod be right.Mr Flanaganrsquos voodoo science is the most totemic example of a culture of saying anything you need to say to thwart the wishes and ambitions of, in this case, ministers and parents, and many teachers with them.The EIS may feel it is doing its job, and doing it well. And some teachers may agree. But others will, I am certain, see the dangers in a longer-term corrosion of the bonds of trust between teachers and parents.Everyone wants teachers to be safe, just as we want doctors, shopkeepers and delivery drivers to be safe. But, by August, we will have had a month of being able to go to hairdressers, shop in non-essential, indoor shops, go to the cinema and the pub, and send our children to nursery, after a seismic suppression of the virus.Given thisto relative normality, combined with the ability to offer further protection through PPE and other enhanced hygiene measures, many inidual teachers will surely now be asking themselves whether their trade union is placing them on the right side of history. They will surely now be asking themselves whether,the attitude of the EIS prevails, a lay person would think teachers are playing their part in the national recovery.The time has come for one of two things to happen. Either the other unions such as the SSTA and the AHDS, which have become relatively less influential, need to emerge from the shadows of the EIS and promote a more reasonable, reputationally-enhancing outlook.Or the teachers who are uncomfortable with their portrayal need to come together and build something new.

He has not been shy in grabbing the glory, buthis plans do not produce results, and furlough proves to be a waiting room for redundancy as many fear, Mr Sunak will bear a large part of the blame.Already, some Conservative MPs are becoming jittery over the ever growing cost of this help. They want, in the words of senior backbencher Sir Edward Leigh, to hear ldquoless about high-spending lefties like President Roosevelt and more about good Conservatives like Margaret Thatcher.But let us say most of the measures work.

Even though he is a stranger to the dole queue, he made a lot of people relieved that they might not be joining it just yet.Before the pandemic hit, Mr Sunak was best known for replacing his party leader on the General Election televised debates circuit. A touch nervous at first, he quickly came into his own. It was clear that fellow debater Nicola Sturgeon rated him.

This is why handwashing and cleaning are so important.The WHOrsquos technical lead for infection prevention and control, Benedetta Allegranzi, finally conceded yesterday that the organisation cannot rule out evidence emerging of airborne transmission in ldquocrowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings.Just days before, she had downplayed the possibility, insisting it was ldquocertainly not supported by solid or even clear evidence.The change in tone follows an open letter penned by Lidia Morawska, a expert in aerosol science at Queensland University of Technology, and signed by  other scientists.They wrote that ldquohand-washing and social distancing are appropriate, but, in our view, insufficient to provide protection from virus-carrying respiratory microdroplets released into the air by infected people.Researchers accused the WHO of being ldquoslow and risk-averse in updating its guidance and allowing ldquoa few conservative voices to shout down dissent because it could mean more expensive and disruptive control measures.The issue has attracted more attention from scientists as countries ease their lockdowns by re-opening offices, restaurants, bars and nightclubs.It has also prompted questions about what level of ventilation is needed in workplaces, schools and nursing homes, and whether ultraviolet light should be used to kill the virus indoors ndash as sunlight does outdoors.All this really depends on what proportion of cases are caused by airborne spread, and that is hard to determine.Some scientists back a ldquoprecautionary principle : until the level of risk is known, follow a path of maximum mitigation such as making face masks mandatory in all indoor settings.Others are more cautious.Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia told New Scientist that he was worried it would confuse the public into thinking a face mask was a better protection than washing their hands.ldquoI think there probably is some airborne transmission, he added.ldquoThe issue is whether that is important enough to justy additional control measures.: Why GPs in Scotlands most deprived communities fear a tsunami of trouble aheadAll this comes after further doubt was shed on the possibility of herd immunity earlier this week by an updated Lancet study showing that just five per cent of Spainrsquos population has developed antibodies, despite having one of the worldrsquos highest death tolls.Given that seroprevalence of at least % would be required, it was concluded that ldquoherd immunity through natural infection is not only highly unethical, but also unachievable.It is unclear what degree of protection antibodies actually offer anyway, as the study ndash the largest in Europe to date ndash also found that over the course of eight weeks, % of participants who had initially tested positive for antibodies had no trace of them by the end.That is not to say they are not immune ndash they could have cellular immunity instead ndash but it is another of the virusrsquo conundrums.Meanwhile, increasing evidence is also emerging about the long-term consequences of infection with Covid-.Studies have found high rates of lung scarring ndash even those who had mild symptoms ndash and of blood clots leading to strokes, heart attacks, lung embolisms, and limb amputations.

The Government in Westminster has failed to balance the budget for years and despite a decade of crippling austerity it is forced to borrow consistently. The current UK national debt is in the region of pound trillion and that is before one adds in the pound billion we ldquoborrowed to bail out the banking industry or the recent poundbn the Bank of England gave the Treasury despite the fact of the bank having a positive balance of less than poundbn.

Perhaps Mr Maciver should try it some time. There were a number of statements remarkably free of this approach, Irsquoll confine myself to some of the highlights.He states that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos approach to handling the Covid- epidemic ldquohas been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos. There were six deaths from the disease in Scotland last week. The number of deaths in England was . Given the proximity of the countries and the fact that Scotland has no control over its borders, this is an extraordinary ergence. How could this be achieved with a ldquocarbon copy approach  Let me help Mr Maciver here: it couldnrsquot. Those outcomes were achieved by the Scottish Government strictly following the advice of its scientic advisory body.Mr Maciver believed in  it would have been an act of self-harm to have voted Yes. While the Scottish Government works hard with limited powers to protect him and his family, in the true spirit of the Scottish Enlightenment, he can reflect on the wisdom of that statement, as a hard Brexit looms on the horizon, threatening to redouble the hardships brought about by the virus.Jim Daly, Edinburgh EH.MARK Smithtries valiantly to make the widespread Scottish desire for independence look equivalent to English nationalism. The first rhetorical trick is to call supporters of Scottish independence ldquonationalists. This sleight of hand is so common as to almost escape notice, but in a professional political commentator itrsquos either sloppy or deliberately slippery. Later, he acknowledges that strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have been unattractive to many, but he attributes this cooler view only to those in what he calls ldquothe centre ground. Those who support Scottish independence for reasons of bringing democracy closer to the people, or from dismay and disillusion with the seemingly endlessly dysal and self-absorbed Westminster establishment, or any other rational argument, donrsquot seem to enter his thinking.He also doesnrsquot notice that the question in YouGovrsquos poll that puts Tory support for English independence at  per cent is highly misleading in the context of Brexit. It asks how the the respondent would vote in a hypothetical referendum to the question ldquoShould England be an independent country  It surely should be obvious that for that still very large proportion of English people who have dficulty distinguishing between England and the UK, this is a direct echo of the Brexit referendum, and that they would be likely to answer it correspondingly.That of course is YouGovrsquos survey howler, but Mr Smith should have known better than to build his convoluted argument about ldquonationalisms around it. Neither does he address the fact, inconvenient for his thesis, that English Tories apparently tend toEnglish nationalism but Scottish Tories are quite free of Scottish nationalism. He has started, it seems, from his pre-determined conclusion that wanting independence for Scotland is little more than a sentimental, even strident, patriotic reflex, and therefore the same sort of thing as Little Englandism. He might not approve of Scottish independence himself, but that does not excuse such spurious ldquoanalysis.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh EH.IN response to questions directed at me by John Jamiesonas to why Scotland has ldquofailed to thrive compared to England: first, he failed to acknowledge that in my letter of July  I was answering specic nonsensical claims by a previous correspondent and at no stage did I suggest that Scotlandhad not performed as well as rUK, which indeed it has.The problem for an independent Scotland is that we spend nearly  per cent more on public servicesthan England and because of our geography most of our businesses and economic activity are directed towards England ndash approximately %. In other words, provided we remain within the UK internal single market these anomalies do not matter a jot. However, a Scotland with hard borders and outside the lucrative UK market, with a massive borrowing requirement , dferent currency, and outside the EUwould make the proverbial perfect storm look a squall in comparison.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.IN the midst of this continuing independence debate, I consider two questions remain unanswered and unresolved. Will Scottish-born UK passport holders and British citizens living in Scotland be deprived of those rights post-independence And will English-born, but happily-settled, UK citizens living their lives in Scotland be deprived of their rights to retain their UK citizenship and passport and be forced to accept a Scottish versionthey wish to remain living here It is neither democratic nor fair to deprive so many of their birthrights andindependence supporters ndashSNP or otherwise ndash wish to secede from the UK they may well be entitled to do so, but they do not have the right to make others

chief executive of the SNP, has been asked to hand over all relevant party communications relating to the internal Scottish Government complaints.He has also been asked to provide the inquiry with details of when he first became aware of the complaints against Mr Salmond and who informed him,as well as any discussions or communications he had with ministers or special advisers.MSPs on the inquiry are looking at how the Scottish Government botched a misconduct probe into Mr Salmond and left taxpayers with a pound, legal bill.They have already decided witnesses will be required to take an oath.Now they have published  letters sent to key players requesting written evidence by August .This will allow the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints to start taking oral evidence in mid-August.The inquirys focus is the Scottish Governmentrsquos in-house probe into complaints of sexual misconduct made against Mr Salmond in  by two female civil servants.After this became public in August that year, Mr Salmond resigned from the SNP, before launchinga crowdfunded judicial review at the Court of Session to have the probersquos findings struck down.In January , the Government admitted in court its probe had been unfair, unlawful and ldquotainted by apparent bias because the investigating officer was in prior contact with the complainants, leaving taxpayers with a pound, bill for Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs.It emerged Ms Sturgeon maintained contact with Mr Salmond while he was being investigated by her officials, leading to accusations she broke the Scottish ministerial code.Now a Holyrood committeewill examine how the Government probe was bungled, the judicial review, and whether Ms Sturgeonrsquos behaviour broke the code.The letter to Ms Sturgeon, published on the Scottish Parliaments website, requests copies of all communications relevant to its remit between the First Minister, Mr Salmond and other relevant iniduals.It also seeks details of all \"relevant communications with the SNP given your dual roles as First Minister and as the leader of the SNP\".It adds: \"This includes all communication, relevant to its remit, relating to the complaints made against Alex Salmond under the Procedure on handling of harassment complaints involving current or former ministers.\"It says the committee is focusing partly on the culture within the Scottish Government between  and , when Mr Salmond was first minister, and on to the present.The letter adds: \"The committee requests details and any relevant correspondence from this period on the culture within the Scottish Government.\"Meanwhile, aletter to Mr Salmond seeks a \"full chronological account of the complaints handling process\" from his perspective.MSPs want to establish who first informed the former first minister of the existence of complaints, when he was informed and the level of detail shared.The committee said it is also interested in \"all contact since then between yourself and Scottish Government officials\" as well as all contact with ministers.The letter adds: \"The committee also requests a list of all those you discussed the details of the complaints with during this period including details of any requests you made for people to support you, including to act as intermediaries.\"The inquiry wants Mr Salmonds full account of the judicial reviewand copies of all relevant documents he holds.It also asked him for all communications with the SNP relatingto the internal Scottish Government complaints made against him.Referring again to the culture of the Government, the letter asks for Mr Salmonds perspective on the safeguards in place for staff, how supported he considers staff would have felt, and what could have been done dferently.Elsewhere, Mr Murrell has been asked for \"details of your first awareness of, presence at, or contributions to, any meetings between two or more of the following: the First Minister the First Ministerrsquos chief of staff [Liz Lloyd] the former First Minister, Alex Salmond and the former First Ministerrsquos former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein\".Further letters from committee convenerLinda Fabiani have been sent to Ms Lloyd, MrAberdein, deputy first minister John Swinney, Lord Advocate James Wolffe, union leaders and former permanent secretaries Sir Peter Housden

among other things.Mr Salmond was cleared of multiple charges of sexual assault earlier this year after a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.The former First Ministers allies have suggested he was

Physical distancing means that we will be using urban spaces dferently and so being aware of each other is important so that we share space safely and sensibly.“This information is there to gently remind people to be mindful of less abled or more vulnerable people.”Linda Bamford, Convener of the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotlandsaid: “We welcome this information notice to raise public awareness and in particular that it draws attention to the need to be considerate towards disabled people, including helping with physical distancing.“Disabled people and older people are telling MACS of their concerns and fears when out and about as pavements and shared pathways are busier and they are finding it harder to keep a safe distance passing others and some people are passing them too fast and too close.

Everyone is in the same boat trying to step-up and deliver.“Before anyone had heard of Covid- we were already planning to equip GP practices for appointments and started that in October last year.”On March  national guidance was issued asking boards to accelerate the roll-out of the technology in an effort to curb the spread of the virus across the country.Kenny added: “Ultimately the increase in Near Me appointments has protected both our patients and staff from possible infection. We were looking to gradually introduce it but events over took that. We have trained more than  clinicians in range of specialisms since then.“There are benefits to Near Me over phone consultations and evidence shows visually you can pick-up signs and body language far more than on a phone call. So where it is clinically appropriate to do so we are having as many of these using Near Me as possible.“The initial focus was on enabling GP Practices, attention was shted to Mental Health Services, AHP and other clinical services traditionally delivered from the Balfour as the pandemic response developed. Working closely with service leads, training was delivered, equipment put in place and appointment processes modied to mirror the GP roll-out.“Uptake from both patients and clinicians has been very encouraging. Our Mental Health service has been able to meet the demands within the community at a time of increased anxiety and isolation.”He added that the uptake across the entire Mental Health Team led to them being asked to contribute to a national learning event to share their experiences.“Our maternity service is also doing very well and, despite only recently taking up the use of the technology, was similarly invited to contribute to a future national learning event due to its success,” Kenny said.“GP Simon Kemp from Daisy Villa has been selected, as one of only six practices in Scotland, to be part of a joint project with NHS Scotland and the Royal College of General Practitioners to develop guidance and help embed virtual appointment within GP practices across Scotland.“Near Me isn#t just about a response to Covid- – it was around before the pandemic. The trick for us is going to be to embed it and it can be the new normal in the future as we continue to protect our community.“For Orkney it has many benefits including providing care closer to home and reducing spend in relation to off island patient travel.“Going forward we will be targeting specialities where we have high numbers of patients travelling – sometimes on a three day round trip. We will work closely with our partner boards to ensure that the recent momentum continues and that the virtual clinic option becomes #business as usual#, where it is clinically appropriate to do so.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

They were aimed at informing communities about the process around the closure of their local church, and the future options for the buildings.Unfortunately only the Sand Church event, on the West Side on Thursday th March was able to take place.As a result the Rev Fran Henderson, transition minister for the Shetland parish, has now invited all interested people to take part in an online buildings consultation to ensure all views are reflected.Dr Henderson said: “Ideally, we would have had face-to-face public community meetings about the upcoming closures, but unfortunately only one – at Sand Church – was able to go ahead due to the lockdown measures.“We are concerned that communities need to have their say on what’s going to happen to our church buildings when they are sold, so we have therefore moved our public consultation online.“No guarantees can be made, but alongside our legal duties as charity trustees, all suggestions and requests received will be taken fully into consideration as we make decisions about the future of these buildings and their contents.”The newly launched buildings consultation surveys are composed of  questions each, with some slight iations according to local circumstances. They are open to all interested community members.The first round of surveys to launch, coinciding with the first phaseof the closures, are: St Ninian#s Church in Bigton the Weisdale kirk the Fetlar kirk the Sullom kirk the Fair Isle kirk St Magnus Church at Hamnavoe, South Yell and the Quarff kirk.These surveys will close at midnight on Monday th August while more will launch in the coming months...Jim Tait is news editor at The Shetland Times.The Lounge Bar in Lerwick is set to re-open on Wednesday th July # although they have warned it will be a #very dferent experience##People shielding from coronavirus will no longer have to remain physically distanced from members of their own home from Friday.A man appeared in private at Lerwick Sherf Court on Wednesday on misuse of drugs charges.

this time to do battle in the Glamaig Stableford competition.Only two played in the competition won by Sandi Beatson # that#s three-in-a-row for her.The boys to come out to play and play they most certainly did in earnest competition for the RNLI Shield.There was a very good turnout on the Saturday of this weekend competition with the weather conditions certainly predicted to favour that particular day#s cohort.Covid  restrictions meant that instead of the normal random #draw# for partners players arranged their own #friendship groups# and appropriate tee times on the required booking sheet.Battle commenced # and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair # a #friend# said his father couldn#t spell # rather limped out in  strokes but a fine  off his  mark coming home garnered a whopping  points to add to the earlier  and his unassailable total.Nothing much of interest in the  but an evil nine and an excellent wee two showed the extremes to which our man travelled on his homeward journey.Rumour has it that #our hero# offered to buy free drinks for everyone # in the sure and certain knowledge that with the lockdown still to be relaxed his money was safe!I also have it on good authority that his often misunderstood droll countenance momentarily offered a fleeting smile of satisfaction in victory before swtly and almost immediately reverting to type.Chris Mackinnon started brightly with only three dozen shots required to pilot his ball round the opening nine holes but  coming home with an horrendous triple bogey  on the final hole may have left a wee bit of a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.Third place went to Dave Webster who ed a very impressive total of  points off his  handicap mark but a few more performances like that and he could be back playing with the big boys again.The size of the field offers a wee bit more scope for reflection and Donalda Johnston found form and Peter Mackenzie, kin to the winner smoothed in one further point behind Dave Webster.Honourable mention too for George Neill who might have #thought he was Archie# having recorded two birdies in his opening seven holes but sadly thereafter the ba# burst.And finally to the mystery of the #Captain#s eagle#.It#s been dficult trying to untangle the whole story occurring as it did in an unofficial, non-counting charity game but a source, when catechised offered the following description -#a Phil Mickelson-type shot landed like a dislodged swan#s feather on the green with precisely the correct velocity to carry it to the hole with not a millimetre to spare#!What preceded the shot that elicited that magniloquent delineation is still to be ascertained. .

Sin carson a tha e cudromach cò bhruidhneas air ar son agus as ar leth. Ceist bhunaiteach dheamocrataigeach a tha sin. Tha i doirbh, oir gu ìre mhòr tha leasachadh na Gàidhlig a’ crochadh air airgead poblach. Tha agus rathaidean, ach tha sinn fhathast an dùil gun cùm airgead poblach iad ann an deagh rian. ’ b’e an Riaghaltas agus a’ Chomhairle a bu chòir a bhith air sin a thogail. An aon rud a thaobh togail rathad rèidh na Gàidhlig! Faodaidh sinn uile ar dìcheall a dhèanamh le spaid is bara, ach is e digearan is rolairean mòra laghail an Riaghaltais a tha dhìth airson rathad susbainteach.Chan e gleanns gun shusbainta gheibh an rathad sin dhuinn.Ach aon uair is gu bheil an Riaghaltas an sàs, cleas maighstir sam bith, bidh iad – gun teagamh – an dùil gun dèan am buidheann a tha iad a’ pàigheadh an toil-san. Tha fhios gur e sin pàirt dhen duilgheadas a tha, agus a bhios, daonnan mu choinneamh cuango mar am Bòrd Cò a tha am Bòrd no MG Alba, mar eisimpleir, a’ riochdachadh: Riaghaltas na h-Alba an Dùn Èideann no na coimhearsnachdan Gàidhlig  Esan a phàigheas am pìobaire# Ged a tha mi airson seo a dhèanamh gu math soilleir: gu bheil mi cho moiteil sa ghabhas às gach neach a tha ag obair anns gach buidheann Gàidhliga tha dealasach is dìcheallach a thaobh na cànain agus dhan chultar agus a tha air an t-uàmhas a dhèanamh dhuinn.Gus an tèid urrasan ionadail, mar a tha Soillse a’ moladh, a stèidheachadh anns na coimhearsnachdan, ge-tà, saoilidh mi nach tig an t-adhartras a tha sinn uile a’ miannachadh.  a bhios aca  Ma bhios na h-urrasan air an taghadh gu poblach, cò gheibh bhòt: dìreach daoine aig a bheil Gàidhlig  Dìreach daoine a tha cleachdadh na Gàidhlig gach latha  Cò tha dol a thomhas sin   didsiteach ann gar clàradh, mar ann an saoghal Sheòrais Orwell Am bi bhòt aig a h-uile neach san sgìre, mar a bu chòir, fiù ’s nuair a tha % no % no % dhiubh gun Ghàidhlig agus coma mu deidhinn, no na h-aghaidh An e baile no sgìre no eilean  Mar a thuirt am fear-sgrùdaidh eile, cò tha dol a’ sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean  No cò tha dol a sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean a bhios a’ sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean  Bha an dearbh dheasbad sin gu math fuilteach aig aon àm eadar Lenin agus Rosa Luxemburg anns an Ruis ag àm an Aramach ann an . ’son an rebholution a’ stiùireadh agus a thoirt air adhart.Chaidh ise a mhurt agus ghlèidh esan an latha, agus bha a’ bhlath air a bhuil.Ach mura creid sinn ann an deamocrasaidh ionadail agus anns na daoine fhèin, chan eil dòchas idir ann. An dèan Riaghaltas na h-Alba strì an aghaidh seo, is iad cho dèidheil air cumhachd a thàladh a-steach dhan mheadhan co-dhiù, mar a tha gach poileasaidh aca thairis na  bliadhna mu dheireadha’ dearbhadh Tha ceistean nas fharsainge ann cuideachd: ceistean a tha mi air togail gach dàrnacha seachdain anns a’ cholbh seo. Tha iad sin ceangailte ri fallaineachd eaconomaigeach nan sgìrean. Mura bheil obraichean ann an Uibhist no anns na Hearadh no ann an Leòdhas no eile, ciamar idir a tha thu dol a chumail òigridh  Agus ma tha obraichean annciamar a nì sinn cinnteach gur e Gàidheila gheibh na h-obraichean sin Oir tha gu leòr de dh’obraichean air a bhith air an cruthachadh as ùr ann an iomadh sgìre thairis na fichead bliadhna chaidh seachad, agus gu tric is e an rud a thachras gun tig Gall air choireigin a-steach a dheànamh na h-obrach sin .Chan eil lagh, moralta no eile, an aghaidh a leithid: cha bhuin an saoghal do dhuine againn. Chan eil e furasta, gun ghuth a ràdh air ceist thaigheadas, far nach fhaigh Gàidheil òga fearann no taigh anns am fuirich iad, eadar prìsean àrd agus margaid mhòr Airbnb.Is dòcha gu bheil cothrom aig A’ Ghàidhealtachd agus aig Na h-Eileanan air toiseach‑tòisichidh ùr a dheanamh a thaobh nan gnothaichean sin ri linn a’ Choròna‑Bhìorais. Nuair a dh’fhalbhas etha fhios nach till sinn gu mar a bha sinn – Gàidhealtachd a’ crochadh air aona-ghnìomhachas – turasachd.  chalpachais o aon cheann den chruinne-cè chun cheann eile.Tha fhios gu bheil cothrom an seo cur romhainn dè da-rìreabh a bhios riatanach dhan Ghàidhealtachd. Cosnaidhean uaine maireannach seasmhach. Ath-sgaoileadh dhen fhearann. Agus cho riatanach agus a tha e ar cànan a chur aig teas-mheadhan gach gnothach sin. Tha an dol a mach aig an “t-Sianal Gàidhlig” fhèinle còrr is % Beurla air na prògraman acana fhianais gum faod thu ainm no bratach Gàidhlig a thoirt air rud sam bith, ach fhathast gur e rud Gallda th’ ann. Bha mi a’ coimhead as ùr air na molaidhean riatanach agus dòchasach air làrach-lìn gaidhlig.tv an la roimhe: ’s truagh nach eil MG Alba, le sporan de £ millean, ag èisteachd riutha.Gu mi-fhortanach, chan eil mòran dòchas agam gun tachair adhartas mòr sam bith.

Tha eagal orm gum falbh an Covid agus tillidh na motor-homes agus Airbnb agus thig an sgìre air ais gu default.   Seagh. Oir chan urrainn dhuinn cor na Gàidhlig gu lèir fhàgail aig lagh no aig Achd no aig bòrd no aig buidheann no aig aithisg no aig rannsachadh eile. Tha am Bòrd air a ràdh gu bheil an siostam a th’ ann ag obrachadh. Bu chòir dhuinn a bhith draghail gu bheil iad air sin a ràdh gu poblach. Tha mi faicinn gu bheil am Ball-Pàrlamaid Tòraidheach Dòmhnall Camshron a-nise ag iarraidh ‘Summit’air a’ Ghàidhealtachd, agus mo bheannachd air airson sin a ghairm.

An sgrìobh mi an dàn seo, no an colbh seo, no an aithisg seo, no an leabhar seo, no an rannsachadh seo, ann an Gàidhligno ann am Beurla  Tha iomadh dòigh ann gus cànain eadar ginealaicha bhrosnachadh, eadar cèilidhean is còmhraidhean, bho litreachas gu làthaireachd.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

But the review team said the issues indicated system-wide problems and that the issues uncovered were unlikely to be unique to those three areas. Additional problems, mistakes and tragedies may have occurred in the healthcare system, the authors said. In Northern Ireland around , women have had vaginal mesh implants, and around  of them were involved in the Sling the Mesh campaign.Baroness Julia Cumberlege, who chaired the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, described how women#s lives had been turned upside down by surgical mesh, adding: They told us about experiencing splintered glass inside them, razors inside them, in their bodies. And that gave them permanent, unremitting pain. She added: We travelled around the UK and met over  women and their families and I have to say, it made such a lasting impression on us. And some of those stories, I will certainly take to my grave. Their experiences were harrowing. We learnt about damaged families under immense strain, relationships that have been destroyed and careers broken. And as a result, financial ruin. A number of mesh-injured women said their doctors, surgeons or GPs ignored or dismissed their concerns. Some clinicians# reactions ranged from it#s all in your head to these are women#s issues or it#s that time of le, the report states. For the women concerned this was tantamount to a complete denial of their concerns and being written off by a system that was supposed to care. The review says women have also raised concerns about missing or altered medical records. And many said they were told the treatment was a new gold standard. The treatment has been used in the pelvis for  years, but the review said that its long-term risk profile is still unknown. Mr Swann said the report highlighted failures in the healthcare system, including the need to listen and understand patients# voices and concerns they had raised around certain treatments. While the focus of the report is on the healthcare system in England, it is recognised that many women from here took the time to submit their experience thereby highlighting similar failures within our service, he said.Mr Swann added: I must apologise to these women and others who were similarly affected, on behalf of the system, and I must offer my thanks to those women for taking the time to highlight these concerns to the review.While our healthcare system does treat the majority of patients safely, the message is that we can do better. We will now give this review report the full and careful consideration it deserves within the local and national context.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metFor sale!

The Taoiseach added that he favoured stronger North-South relations.Mr Aiken said: It#s good to see the new Taoiseach appreciating the reality of the situation rather than chasing the destabilising influences of a border poll. I would much rather that we rebuild relationships. We have always said that we want North-South, East-West relationships to work and we want to move away from the toxic relationships of the past. We should seek to use this as an opportunity to improve on what went before. But Sinn Fein accused the Taoiseach of abdicating his responsibility as head of government.Donegal TD Padraig Mac Lochlainn said: Whilst Fianna Fail occasionally pays lip service to its republican roots, it has long since abandoned any desire to advocate for a united Ireland, particularly under Micheal Martin#s leadership.A referendum on Irish unity is expressly provided for in the Good Friday Agreement - despite what the Taoiseach thinks. This is an agreement endorsed by the people of this island, north and south, overwhelmingly over  years ago.But SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: Micheal Martin is right - no amount of slogans will win the campaign for Irish unity. A successful campaign demands that we build new relationships between the people of this island, maximising North-South cooperation and building on the potential of the Good Friday Agreement. It#s up to this generation of political leaders to spill our sweat breaking down the decades of mistrust that have ided people and pushed us further apart.DUP MLA Christopher Stalford said: We want to be good neighbours with the Republic of Ireland, but being part of the world#s fth largest economy is of direct benefit to people#s lives. What Northern Ireland needs is not a repeat of tired calls for a border poll, but a fresh desire to actually get on with governing responsibly on behalf of everyone. Republicans have a responsibility to look beyond their own narrow base and work for the greater good of society.  Belfast   Most ReadNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metFor sale!

There is a potential for public disorder.Read More All eyes will be on us: Loyalists urge bonfire organisers to follow coronavirus regulations The north Belfast parade is one of three to have been so far categorised as sensitive by the commission, which was informed last month by the Attorney General that it had no legal powers to prevent parades from taking place.As the Twelfth falls on a Sunday this year, official demonstrations were due to take place the next day. However, the Orange Order announced in April it would not hold demonstrations due to the pandemic.More than  loyalist bands have made notications to parade between July  and . The watchdog said the Ballysillan notied route includes a parading area with a history of sensitive parades and it had previously received substantial objections to loyalist marches.The parade has been limited to two-and-a-half hours and it is prohibited from certain residential areas, conditions the commission described as proportionate, necessary and fair.It noted the parade organiser had said they were willing to avoid Squires Hill Road and had prepared a banner reminding supporters not to follow the band, adding leaflets echoing the same message had been distributed to households.Meanwhile, the Stoneyford Somme parade has been told by the commission not to enter Stoneyford village on July , and must only last  minutes. The original notication had requested an hour.The same time limit restriction has been imposed on the local Sons of William Flute Band parade, which is to take place on July  and has been ordered to reroute its outward parade, as well as being prohibited from walking itsroute.The commission noted that the respective organisers of the Stoneyford parades had a history of notying paradesthat do not take place, adding both bands have fewany members, and may exist in name only.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Pupils from St Patrick’s and St Joseph’s Primary School Glenullin Garvagh took part in the Healthy Kidz Virtual Sports Day challenge, recording results in an app designed for the competition. The competition encouraged children to record a -day streak of activity to be entered into a draw for a pound Spar voucher alongside the main event. P pupil Grace Bradley clinched a ‘fun day’ prize for her class by recording the highest number of points over five weeks, while P pupil Aoibhinn Mullan took home the voucher. googletag.cmd.push The school’s Sports Day co-ordinator, Sheena McKeown, was delighted with the effort made by all the children. “It was such a good achievement, given the fact that we aren’t in school and we’re not together, we still did so well,” she told the County Derry Post. “It didn’t just revolve around the Sports Day, children could get points for wellbeing and staying off their electronic devices.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On  May, George Floyd - a black man – was surrounded by four white men in police unorms, all with guns. Three of them stood by while one literally squeezed the le out of him – all the time knowing they were being filmed. We watched this video – like many others globally - and imagined it was our son, our husband, our brother, our friend. It was traumatic. The familiarity and the horror of these images demanded that we raise our voices and demonstrate our anger and pain. But that is the US you might think - it is not like that here. There are not so many black people in Northern Ireland, so it is less visible but systemic racism is pervasive. The qualications of many black nurses working in the NHS are not recognised for further post-graduate study. This is discriminatory and obstructs career development and promotion. While around % of nurses and % of doctors in the NHS are from ethnic minorities, none are senior managers. googletag.cmd.push The fact that we don’t actually know how many black people there are in NI is a symptom of this institutional blindness. We are so unimportant we aren’t even counted. We have been calling for ethnic monitoring for years as part of the Racial Equality Strategy but are yet to see concrete action. On  June, we peacefully protested – to show solidarity with George Floyd but also to raise awareness about racism here. Unlike other large public gatherings during the pandemic, all participants wore masks. Hand sanitizer was available and social distancing was enforced. The messaging about the events stressed public health. googletag.cmd.push But when we arrived at the Guildhall what happened to us  We were intimidated. There were armoured vehicles everywhere. I was surrounded by three white men, all in police unorms, all with guns. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the police are routinely armed. It is also the only part of the UK where organizers and participants in BLM rallies have been prosecuted and fined. We are hurt and disappointed that the PSNI cannot see this. They seem to be sorry that we are upset but incapable of understanding why we’re upset. In their statement on the protest they describe George Floyd’s death as “avoidable and unnecessary”. It was intentional murder. One week after our events, another protest to “protect statues” was organized in Belfast. There were no fines and no prosecutions. When we have challenged the PSNI and the Justice Minister on this blatant double standard we have received confused, contradictory, and inaccurate information. Last week there was another prominent large public gathering. The PSNI have said they are reviewing evidence. The policing style at both these events was markedly dferent – we will raise this with the Equality Commission for possible breach of our human rights. What made our events distinct  There are no elected black politicians in Northern Ireland. Our community is not represented in power sharing institutions. The PSNI demonstrated that they can show understanding of context and nuance when policing majority groups amid this pandemic. Yet the one visible event organized by black people was criminalized from the outset – with additional enforcement powers added to the Coronavirus Regulations rushed into force at pm on  June.  The PSNI have said they support our aims – but do they  The protests were about police violence and impunity. Have they thought about the way black people have historically been criminalized how they are disproportionately stopped and searched why young black men are perceived as dangerous and young women sexually harassed  We have made three demands to the PSNI: - Rescind the fines - Drop the prosecutions - Issue a public apology The PSNI tell us there is nothing they can do. They are hiding behind process arguing that while there is a review by the Police Ombudsman their hands are tied. They want to move forward but after the way we were treated on  June there is no trust. Cressida Dick of the politan police did not hesitate to apologise for the behaviour of her officers who shared selfies of two murdered black women – “ it is as it appears to be” – even though there is an ongoing investigation. She apologized because she knew it was wrong and how damaging such behaviour by police officers is to public trust and community safety. We truly want to work with the police – it is vital we can feel safe, protected, and equal before the law. But we need actions not words. We need the PSNI to demonstrate they can treat us with the same sensitivity and understanding they treat majority communities.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The markets the fishermen serve have been decimated by the Covid- crisis but Pat Close, Chair of Lough Neagh Fishermen’s Co-Operative Society, said they are hopeful of an announcement soon. “Discussions have been going on for several weeks between Lough Neagh Fishermen’s Co-operative and senior DAERA officials with a view to securing some financial support,” he said. “The fishermen of Lough Neagh’s markets across Europe have been effectively wiped out in recent months due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “A workable scheme which accommodates the unique nature of the industry on the lough is at an advanced stage of drafting and are hopeful Minister Poots will be in a position to announce the scheme in the coming days.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, welcomed the progression. “Discussions between the Department and the Coop are bearing fruit and we encourage the Minister to ensure financial support is delivered to hard-pressed fishing families,” she said. “Fishing is a labour-intensive industry, which unfortunately sees low s for most even in the best of times. “ has been a challenging year for many sectors, and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our local fishing communities has been hugely damaging. googletag.cmd.push “The Lough Neagh Eel Fishing Co operative have raised a number of worries for the industry directly with the Minister, most notably the total decimation of the European market for eels. “Most of the eels produced in Lough Neagh end up on the plates of festival-attenders in Holland and Germany, and as lockdown rolled out, this demand obviously disappeared. This happened just as the fishing season began, leaving many fishermen with questions over the viability of their livelihood, and absolutely no income during lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme is being run in association with Northern Healthy Lestyles Partnership and supported by Causeway Coast Vineyard and Henderson Retail. The kits include a slow cooker, cookbook and recipe ingredients for two meals and it is hoped they will provide a more sustainable option for shielding households to make healthy meals. Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Alderman Mark Fielding, said the kits would offer ‘practical support’. “It’s vital that we support the health and wellbeing of those who are shielding and this is a great example of how working with other agencies can enhance the lives of our residents,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “Practical support like this is very important during these unprecedented times, and these kits will make a real dference to vulnerable people across the area.” Michelle Donnelly from Henderson Retail said the initiative was a ‘fantastic idea’. “Since the beginning of lockdown our store teams have been doing all they can for their local communities, from providing home deliveries to the isolated and vulnerable, to helping foodbanks, charities and community groups,” she said. “Providing these ingredients means those who are still shielding can still enjoy a fresh, hot meal without any hassle. The slow cooker initiative is a fantastic idea and we’re very proud to be part of it.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme is being run in association with Northern Healthy Lestyles Partnership and supported by Causeway Coast Vineyard and Henderson Retail. The kits include a slow cooker, cookbook and recipe ingredients for two meals and it is hoped they will provide a more sustainable option for shielding households to make healthy meals. Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Alderman Mark Fielding, said the kits would offer ‘practical support’. “It’s vital that we support the health and wellbeing of those who are shielding and this is a great example of how working with other agencies can enhance the lives of our residents,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “Practical support like this is very important during these unprecedented times, and these kits will make a real dference to vulnerable people across the area.” Michelle Donnelly from Henderson Retail said the initiative was a ‘fantastic idea’. “Since the beginning of lockdown our store teams have been doing all they can for their local communities, from providing home deliveries to the isolated and vulnerable, to helping foodbanks, charities and community groups,” she said. “Providing these ingredients means those who are still shielding can still enjoy a fresh, hot meal without any hassle. The slow cooker initiative is a fantastic idea and we’re very proud to be part of it.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

for to boost Comber centre  ","story":"PLANS for an exciting new lsquocafe culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Championship draws made  ","story":"THE draws for the  Down Football and Hurling

have welcomed the resumption of church services after they were suspended  weeks ago due to the Covid- pandemic.Services resumed on Monday after the Northern Ireland Executive announced that public worship could restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable. Sermons will also be kept short.He said that anyone wishing to view their Sunday worship online can log on to downpatrickpresbyterian.org or visit their Facebook page for live streaming.The Dean of Down Cathedral, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said he was looking forward to beginning public worship again and welcoming everyone back this Sunday.However, he urged anyone feeling unwell not to come to church.In a letter to parishioners he said: ldquoTheto worship will be on a phased basis beginning with some of the larger churches first.ldquoWe will also adopt a dferent pattern of service times during the summer period, spreading services throughout the day.He added that face coverings were not a requirement at this stage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Driving force  ","story":"TEENAGE motor racing sensation Daniel Harper has successfully tackled the world famous Nurburgring race circuit in Germany.The  year-old from Annahilt drove the notoriously dficult -mile track for the first time when he made his debut outing in the Nurburgring Endurance Series with the BMW Junior Team.Afterwards he described it as an ldquoinvaluable learning experience, despite an unfortunate technical problem which meant he couldnrsquot contest the race itself.Harper, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in motorsport was announced as a member of the coveted BMW Junior Team programme in January.He was completing an extensive pre-season training schedule when the coronavirus pandemic led to the postponement of the programme in March.At the start of June, he ed to Germany and last week he drove the Nurburgring mdash scene of some of motor racingrsquos greatest feats mdash as he successfully completed his DMSB permit test for the track.For the opening race event, Harper and his team-mates shared a BMW Mi Racing, the German manufacturerrsquos potent, entry-level car.

In this his third series, Joe s with another fascinating set of programmes celebrating the mighty achievements of the past that have transformed our daily living and reveals the cutting-edge technology that is shaping the future of our infrastructure.With the help of the experts in their respective fields, Joe reveals the stories behind some of Northern Irelandrsquos well-known landmarks and also sheds light on how civil engineering is in operation quite literally beneath our feet!Get ready to go salt mining, quarry blasting, castle roofing, engine restoring, road surfacing and flood preventing to name a few of the activities that Joe gets involved with in this series.In the opening episode which airs next Monday night at pm, Joe visits Delamont which nestles on the shores of the internationally acclaimed waterway.The country park is home to the largest monolith or standing stone in the UK and Ireland, with the signicant landmark standing  metres tall and weighing in at almost  tonnes.Ancient civilisations throughout the world marked important occasions and cosmic events by erecting megaliths, often in circles or other formations, but sometimes as free-standing monoliths. There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

This allowed pupils from beginners through to seniors to engage in drama lessons and fully prepare for their exams.The lessons were fun-filled and although each of the pupils were in their own homes, they were able to interact with one another, as well as their teacher, to continue to develop their communication and performance skills.They discussed and recited their favourite novels, poetry and some unseen extracts.Clare said: ldquoEach and every one of the pupils adapted so well which is a testament to their resilience during such uncertain times. They are all a real credit to their parents who were so very supportive throughout the whole experience.The exam took place with a New Era Academy examiner in England assessing the pupils online via Zoom.Clare said: ldquoThe whole experience was so smooth and parents even commented on how easy it was to use. They commented that the examiner was friendly, made the children feel at ease but was thorough and professional in her approach.The third term of speech and drama was certainly very dferent. Clare had lessons for everyone, even those who chose not to do exams.ldquoEach lesson was fun and vibrant and certainly allowed the children to continue to develop in confidence and perform on screen with their friends each and every week, she added.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_beedcdcdcbfaaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baeccffaffcfac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
