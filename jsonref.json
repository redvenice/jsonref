First he filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming he \u0027couldn\u0027t afford\u0027 the $5million demo cost. That was dismissed.Then he filed an appeal against Judge Karlan\u0027s order to tear down the giant house. That too was denied.He went to California\u0027s Supreme Court to try to save his project. But the state\u0027s highest court torpedoed his efforts, refusing even to hear the case.Still undeterred, Hadid\u0027s lawyers filed a second appeal - this time against Judge Karlan\u0027s decision to appoint a receiver to oversee destruction of the house. He lost that appeal as well.Last month, Hadid\u0027s legal team filed a third appeal, this one against the $2.9 million judgment awarded to the neighbors by the civil trial jury."},{"url":null,"title":"England offer Covid jabs 5s Vaccines rolled non urgent basis","story":"Share this article Healthy children face a vanishingly low risk of severe illness from the virus, with only six children dying of the virus in England\u0027s first year of the pandemic. And two doses of a jab offers as little as 10 per cent protection against catching the antibody-resistant Omicron variant, UK data suggests.Many scientists have questioned the need to vaccinate children when so many have already had Covid.The Office of National Statistics estimates nearly three-quarters of youngsters aged 8 to 11 had Covid antibodies as of January 10. Normally the JCVI\u0027s recommendations are accepted by the Department of Health and implemented within a matter of days.But there are reports that No10 stepped in and blocked its publication last week so it could \u0027review\u0027 the advice.It is unclear what exactly caused the hold up, but in the past ministers have expressed frustration at the JCVI\u0027s caution over jabbing children.The group initially dragged its heels on recommending jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds in September, citing a lack of safety data and concerns about side-effects. In the end ministers had to circumvent the JCVI, and relied on Professor Chris Whitty and the chief medical officers in the devolved nations to approve the jabs on the basis they would prevent further disruption to schooling. There is a suggestion the Government wanted to announce the roll out to five to 11-year-olds as part of Boris Johnson\u0027s plan for England to live with Covid like flu.That strategy is set to be unveiled in Parliament after the recess on February 21 and include radical plans to ditch even the most fundamental Covid rules.Vaccination rates for children are similarly low in the US, where just three in 10 five to 11-year-olds have received one Covid jab and two in 10 are double-jabbed, according to data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Children are given two Pfizer injections — which are a third of the dose given to adults — three weeks apart.Vaccine uptake is highest among white and mixed-race youngsters and lowest among black children. And children from the richest families are nearly three times more likely to be vaccinated (28.2 per cent) compared to those from the poorest areas (10.7 per cent).CDC data shows 17 per cent of children aged five to 11 rushed forward for their first jab in the month after the US approved the vaccine for the age group on November 2.But since then, uptake has slumped, with only eight per cent of opting to get the jab in the following month.The CDC\u0027s website states children as young as six months could be eligible for a Covid vaccination \u0027soon\u0027, with the country\u0027s Food and Drug Administration due to make a decision by February 21.But the FDA last week warned its announcement on the rollout to babies and toddlers is at least two months away. It is waiting for an update on the efficacy of three doses in the age group from Pfizer before it makes a decision. "},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook owner Meta promotes Nick Clegg equal founder Mark Zuckerberg","story":"Share this article Chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, said on Twitter that the Meta, Metamates, me slogan was in reference to a \u0027naval phrase which Instagram has used for a while\u0027 - \u0027Ship, Shipmates, self\u0027.The word Metamates was an original idea suggested by Douglas Hofstadter, scholar of cognitive science, physics, and comparative literature, after an employee of MEta asked him for ideas, according to Bosworth.These changes, which also include a call from Zuckerberg for staff not to \u0027nice ourselves to death,\u0027 are part of a bid to build a new corporate identity. Zuckerberg explained that the \u0027naval-inspired\u0027 new slogan, that has spread from Instagram to the whole firm, was about being good stewards of the company.\u0027It\u0027s about the sense of responsibility we have for our collective success and to each other as teammates. It\u0027s about taking care of our company and each other,\u0027 he said.\u0027At the end of the day, values aren\u0027t what you write on a website but what we hold each other accountable for every day. I encourage you to reflect on these values and what they mean to you as we start working on this next chapter for our company.\u0027 The announcement was made at a town hall meeting, but also streamed through the virtual reality-based Horizon Venues.As well as new slogans, and a new name for employees, this is a shift away from a particularly open culture for the social media firm.Insiders predict this is a move to avoid leaks and repetitional damage, asking everyone employed by Meta to consider the welfare of the firm as a whole.Meta employs more than 71,000 people, all connected to an internal \u0027Facebook-like\u0027 chat system called Workplace that hosts deep debates on everything from Black Lives Matter to elections, as well as internal research on the company\u0027s impact. This is part of the open culture, once prized by the firm. But in recent years this information has made it out beyond the corporate firewall.In 20221 Frances Haugen, a whisleblower, released thousands of documents that had been posted to Workplace that revealed research into social harms caused by the likes of Instagram and Facebook.This prompted the firm to shut down groups within Workplace that were open to a lot of people, and having communications teams tell staff posting critical comments about Facebook and its business, that they were being disrespectful.Facebook has been faced with years of controversy, mainly linked to the sharing of data and impact on the mental health of its users, and politics of countries. Part of the name change to Meta was to shift away from being a social media brand, into a new \u0027metaverse\u0027 company, that also sold hardware such as the Oculus Rift.The rebranding came soon after a series of whistleblower reports that revealed how much damage to society Facebook, and its subsidiaries, was doing to society.This came in the form of affecting the body image of young women, through to allowing the spread of disinformation - on everything from vaccines to politics.    The firm is still facing legal battles, including a law suit from the state of Texas over the use of facial recognition by Facebook.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who filed the lawsuit in state District Court in Marshall, said the company\u0027s capture of facial geometry in photographs that users uploaded between 2010 and 2021 resulted in \u0027tens of millions of violations\u0027 of Texas law, according to the Wall Street Journal. Early in February Facebook was ordered to remove content defaming a politician and post a banner on its Austrian homepage announcing the ruling after losing a legal battle, which also saw the internet giant pay €4,000 in damages. Yesterday it was announced that Meta had settled a decade-old class action lawsuit over the use of cookies in 2010 and 2011 that tracked people even when logged out. As part of the proposed settlement, which must still be approved by a judge, Meta has agreed to delete all the data it \u0027wrongfully collected\u0027 during that period. The company, which posted profits of $39.37 billion in 2021, will also pay $90 million to users who filed a claim, after lawyer fees are deducted.\u0027Reaching a settlement in this case, which is more than a decade old, is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we\u0027re glad to move past this issue,\u0027 said Meta spokesperson Drew Pusateri in a statement on Tuesday.  adverts.addToArray({pos:mpu_factbox})AdvertisementShare this article"},{"url":null,"title":"Photo diary six months French Riviera Rolling Stones 1971 feature new exhibition","story":"Share this articleUp Close and Personal With The Rolling Stones by Dominique Tarlé — Blind Magazine"},{"url":null,"title":"Biden taps non binary drag queen look nuclear waste","story":"Share this article Brinton, who has a Master\u0027s degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) writes in their LinkedIn bio that they are working towards \u0027Solving the World\u0027s #NuclearWaste Challenges and Protecting LGBTQ Youth from #ConversionTherapy.\u0027 They currently work as a director of global political strategy at Deep Isolation, a nuclear waste disposal company.

Last week, MPs on parliament’s spending watchdog warned that Brexit red tape has damaged Britain’s trade with the EU.

Elsewhere today, companies such as Nestlé , Reckitt Benckiser and Standard Chartered are reporting results. European markest are set to open a little lower, with the Ukraine crisis firmly in focus. The US has said that Russia has deployed another 7,000 troops to the border, while Ukraine has denied claims by Russian-backed separatists that it has conducted mortar attacks on their terrirory. Reuters has the details: The selloff came as Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and Ukraine’s military, blamed each other for the shelling reported this morning. It’s a sign of how banks were returning to bumper payouts after weathering the Covid-19 pandemic in better shape than expected, as most workers face a painful squeeze on their finances. London-headquartered Standard Chartered said the payout increase reflected a normalisation of bonuses after a lean 2020, but it also reflected a hot hiring market as lenders worldwide paid up to retain key staff. The bigger bonus pool came as Standard Chartered set out plans to cut annual expenses by $1.5bn, as part of a broader goal to achieve double-digit returns by 2024, which it outlined on Thursday as it reported annual results. This bonus season is expected to be the most lucrative since the 2008 global financial crisis, as banks benefit from the economic recovery and a boom in takeover deals. Resolution has analysed UK migration trends, and concluded that the economic impact of ending freedom of movement has been exaggerated by both its supporters and opponents. The new regime is driving changes in the UK labour market, particularly in lower-paying industries which rely on migrant labour and typically see high staff turnover, such as farming or food production But Resolution report’s found that while the Government’s policy is likely to reduce migration into the UK, it is unlikely to significantly boost productivity or deliver a big hit to the public finances. But, the reporst says we shouldn’t expect a reduction in migrant workers to automatically drive up wages for UK-born workers in these same sectors. Firms may look to use labour-saving technology instead -- leading to fewer jobs. If they can’t, they must choose between raising wages and raising prices (hitting incomes elsewhere in the economy), leading to production falling over the medium-to-long term.  If low-productivity, migrant-reliant sectors like farming and food manufacturing shrink, then average productivity could rise. Even so, the Prime Minister’s claims that controlled migration is the key to a new high wage economic strategy “are overdone”, Resolution says.  Kathleen Henehan, Senior Research and Policy Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, explains: Late last year, the government extended the UK seasonal agricultural workers’ visa scheme for another three years , meaning fruit and vegetable growers will be able to recruit overseas workers to help bring in harvests, following warnings that crops would rot in the fields otherwise. One-in-five workers in food manufacturing in 2017-19 were from the EU and would be ineligible for a SWV, meaning the sector is likely to need to change significantly or shrink in the years ahead, Resolution’s report found. Brexit trade frictions have also been cited as a factor pushing down business confidence in Scotland. Scottish businesses are less optimistic than elsewhere in the UK, according to the ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales) Business Confidence Monitor, released this morning. This may be because domestic sales and export performance have been more subdued than the UK average over the last year. Scottish exports of fresh fish and seafood were quickly disrupted when the Brexit trade deal came in last year, with delays due to new paperwork such as health certificates and customs documentation. The survey also found that Scottish firms are facing recruitment challenges and rising costs, For the first time since the BCM survey began, the availability of non-management skills and staff turnover were the most prominent growing challenges for companies.

The worst of the snow and sleet is expected in the northern half of the country, while the high winds are expected in the south.It is expected Friday’s storm will be “short and sharp” which could mean red warnings in some parts of the country.In addition, a status-orange gale and storm force warning for all Irish coastal waters and the Irish Sea will come into effect from midnight on Friday, until 9pm Friday evening.Met Éireann hydrometeorologist Jennifer Canavan said Ireland was “in a period of high tides at the moment and this in combination with strong winds and stormy conditions means there is a high risk of large coastal waves and coastal flooding on Friday, especially along southern and eastern coasts.“As such we’re urging people to take extreme care near coastal areas and paths.”A status-yellow marine gale warning is in place for all coasts of Ireland and on the Irish Sea until noon on Thursday, with winds expected to reach gale force 8 or strong gale force 9.‘Challenging conditions’Met Éireann meteorologist Matthew Martin said Storm Eunice was expected to bring further challenging conditions, “as strong winds, heavy rain and snow moves across the country”.“At the moment it looks like northern and western areas are most likely to see the heaviest snow falls, with southern areas expected to see the strongest winds. However, we’re still a few days ahead and the details of when and where are likely to change,” he said. “With this in mind, we’re urging people to keep a very close eye on the forecast and warnings for their area as these may change in the coming days.”The Government’s crisis management team is monitoring the situation and further updates will be issued on Thursday morning.In a statement on Wednesday evening it said that only necessary travel should be undertaken during periods of orange weather warnings.Around the country precautionary measures are being taken in case of flooding. Waterford City and County Council has said flood barriers for the City and Passage may be deployed on Thursday afternoon and the situation is being actively monitored.The Road Safety Authority has appealed to road users to exercise caution over the coming days.Meanwhile, Gas Networks Ireland said it does not anticipate any disruption to gas supplies during this week’s forecasted storms.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 government expects nphet to recommend mask wearing be voluntary","story":"Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan is expected to write to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly  following the first meeting of Nphet since January. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThe Government expects that most mask-wearing, including in schools, will become voluntary after the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) meets on Thursday to review the Irish Covid-19 situation. Taoiseach Micheál Martin last night signalled the move as he told the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party about a meeting with chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan. Mr Martin is said to have delivered an optimistic assessment of the current Covid-19 situation. He said there would need to be a continued focus on vaccination as almost 800,000 people who had the disease recently are set to become eligible for booster shots next month.Dr Holohan is expected to write to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly with his assessment following Nphet’s first meeting since January.Nphet is expected to say the progress of Covid-19 since then has been in line with projections and that the harm caused by the disease has further reduced. While the number of daily infections remains high compared to previous waves, officials are likely to note the declining numbers needing hospital and intensive care treatment.A further 108 deaths related to Covid-19 were reported in the last week, bringing the total to 6,399 since the start of the pandemic. An additional 5,268 PCR-test confirmed cases were reported yesterday, with 4,613 positive antigen tests registered on the HSE’s online portal. Some 631 patients were being treated in hospital for Covid-19 on Wednesday, down four in 24 hours, including 62 people in intensive care units, a decrease of one. Public transportWhile the remaining restrictions are not due to expire until the end of this month, there is optimism in Government that Nphet may recommend the end of mandatory mask wearing in most environments, though they may still be required in healthcare settings and on public transport.Senior Government sources said they expected the requirement to wear masks in schools could be ended from next week, but that they would await Nphet’s advice. The Government is likely to recommend that people continue to wear masks in situations where they perceive a risk of Covid-19 infection. Mr Martin has said that he would favour moving to a voluntary regime as the pandemic recedes. However, there is some concern at the relatively low rate of take-up of the vaccine among five to 11 year-olds, which is at 28 per cent.Teaching unions and school managers say they would prefer a gradual relaxation of the Covid-19 rules. Minister for Education Norma Foley yesterday said public health advice had served schools well during the pandemic and that whatever changes are recommended would be implemented in the education system. She said she anticipated that advice around hand hygiene, the need for symptomatic staff or pupils to stay at home and enhanced cleaning would likely remain.AbsencesStaff representatives say the volume of Covid-19 in schools remains a challenge and is resulting in high levels of pupil and teacher absences.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) called for a “pragmatic and cautious” approach to any changes to school mitigation measures.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) said a sudden relaxation could disrupt preparations for the Junior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams. “If we stop everything all of a sudden, there is a risk that we’ll have lots of students and teachers missing,” said TUI general secretary Michael Gillespie.The two main school principals’ representative groups said they would be guided by whatever public health measures are announced. Some inidual principals said they looked forward to a full resumption of school activities such as concerts, plays, choirs and in-person parent-teacher meetings. Meanwhile, all children aged five to 11 in Northern Ireland are to be offered Covid-19 vaccines following advice from the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They will be offered two paediatric doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with an interval of at least 12 weeks between them. Five further deaths of people who previously tested positive for Covid-19 were reported in the North on Wednesday, along with another 2,889 cases. There were 474 Covid-19 patients in hospitals including 12 in intensive care.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 time to lift mask mandate immunologist says","story":"Prof Paul Moynagh: ‘If we don’t lift mask restrictions now, when will we lift them?’ Photograph: iStockIt is time to lift the mandate to wear masks, an immunologist has said, as “now is as good as it’s going to get” with regard to cases of Omicron.It comes as the Government expects that most mask-wearing, including in schools, will become voluntary after the National Public Health Emergency Team meets on Thursday to review the Irish Covid-19 situation.Prof Paul Moynagh said there was now a level of immunity to Covid-19 in the population because of vaccination and asked: “If we don’t lift mask restrictions now, when will we lift them?”He said masks had a benefit, but the Omicron variant was difficult to control. He said the variant was less severe than previous versions of the virus and the high case numbers were not translating into high hospital numbers or severe illness.Some people would continue to wear masks and carry out antigen tests as there was a move towards “personal evaluation of risk”, Prof Moynagh said.However, he said he hoped there would not be conflict in workplaces between colleagues who had differing opinions on mask-wearing in the workplace.That fear was also voiced by the general secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union, Dermot O’Leary, who said his members were concerned there could be conflict between passengers over the wearing of masks.Mr O’Leary agreed with a suggestion by immunologist Prof Christine Loscher on Wednesday that it would be better to wait until the weather was better and seasonal factors did not have an impact on the virus to lift the rule, and he suggested “maybe at the end of March” as a timeline.Infectious diseases consultant Dr Clíona Ní Cheallaigh said: “There’s still an awful lot of Covid circulating around, so I think if you don’t want to get Covid I would suggest very strongly that you continue to wear your masks.”Dr Ní Cheallaigh said “unfortunately” the vaccine did not offer 100 per cent protection and recent high case numbers were likely due to people with compromised immune systems being infected with Covid-19.Pregnant women were particularly vulnerable to infection, she added. “If there’s one group I really implore to get vaccinated, it’s pregnant women. Pregnant women do not do well with Covid, so they’re still ending up in intensive care.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"church keen to secure value of its lands for future sale","story":"The intervention by the archdiocese can be seen an effort to preserve the potential value of church lands that might later be sold for housing.  Photograph: Alan BetsonA move by Dublin City Council to change land zoning rules in its mammoth new development plan prompted a planning submission from the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.At a basic level, the argument turns on a narrow technical question: what exactly can be built on church land? But the issues are bigger than that.The move casts light on profound change in society that has left the Catholic Church with a diminished role and raises questions about its property holdings.In a booming property market, the intervention by the archdiocese can also be seen an effort to preserve the potential value of church lands that might later be sold for housing as congregations decline.It comes with housing pressures ever-present on the political agenda and a deepening sense of crisis in the city’s property market, which has left many young people wondering whether they will ever be able to buy their own home.The council’s 2022-2028 draft development plan will set the legal parameters for building in the city for the rest of the decade. It will have big implications for all property owners of scale in the city, including the church, which has major holdings throughout Dublin and, indeed, the rest of the State.Dozens of archdiocese church sites have the zoning category Z15, which has the basic objective of protecting and providing for community uses and social infrastructure. Noting in the draft plan that Z15 lands have “come under increased pressure for residential development”, the council has proposed fresh curbs on any developments on such properties.‘Key objective’“Protecting and facilitating the ongoing use of these lands for community and social infrastructure is a key objective of the council. The council are committed to strengthening the role of Z15 lands and will actively discourage the piecemeal erosion and fragmentation of such lands,” the draft plan says.“Limited residentialoffice development on Z15 lands will only be allowed in highly exceptional circumstances where it can be demonstrated by the institutional landowner that the proposed development is required in order to maintain or enhance the functionoperational viability of the primary institution on the lands.”The draft goes on to say that the cessation of an existing social or community use on a site or a “change in land ownership” does not extinguish or negate the function of such lands for community and social infrastructure use.No matter what the long-term plan is for particular church lands, it is clear that such measures would erode the potential sale value of such property if the church ever wanted to sell.The archdiocese insists it has no proposals for any change of use on any church site apart from previously disclosed plans for property at Finglas West. But the central thrust of its submission to the council marks a robust claim to alter the zoning on dozens of properties and, thereby, to enhance their value.Legal opinionCompiled by Brock McClure planning consultants, and backed up with a forceful legal opinion from solicitors Mason Hayes \u0026amp Curran, the church’s 130-page submission is one of almost 1,350 published on the council’s website.The archdiocese identifies each of 33 church sites with Z15 zoning and seeks to change the zoning to Z12, whose objective is to “ensure existing environmental amenities are protected in the predominantly residential future use of these lands”.The reason it cites for seeking the change is the interests of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area “and the provision of residential accommodation” on appropriately located sites.Brock McClure wrote: “Our client is confident that a Z12 zoning, as set out in the Draft Plan, will allow them to protect their current pastoral, community, educational and religious requirements and obligations, whilst, in some instances, allowing them to achieve their objective regarding the delivery of social and affordable housing.”The submission says the church concurs that the Z12 “narrative” applies, in that “these are lands, the majority of which are or which have been institutional use, which may be developed for other uses in the future”.This may well be a long-term play by the archdiocese. But the submission strives for freedom of manoeuvre when it comes to the future of its lands.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin archdiocese urges rezoning church sites to allow homebuilding","story":"The properties listed in the submission from the archdiocese include Our Lady of Good Council Church in Drimnagh. Photograph: Courtesy Mourne Road Parish The Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin has urged Dublin City Council to assign dozens of church sites in the city for\u0026nbspzoning that would allow homes be built on them.The archdiocese insists there are no current proposals to change the use of any churches other than previously published plans for lands at Finglas West.But a legal planning submission makes it clear that the church wants to retain freedom of manoeuvre to develop housing on some sites in the future.The properties listed in a 130-page submission from the archdiocese include 33 churches in areas such as Artane, Ballymun, Beaumont, Cabra, Griffith Avenue, Drimnagh, Navan Road, Raheny, Walkinstown, Terenure, Harrington Street, Church Street and James’ Street.The council has said it wants to tighten the zoning rules governing such sites to preclude any housing or office developments in all but “highly exceptional” circumstances.A paper produced for the church by planning consultants Brock McClure says the zoning should be altered because the council’s move “unfairly inhibits any development options our clients wish to pursue, should the timing be right to rationalise some of the uses at certain locations”.“Many of the subject sites are located in disadvantaged areas where the delivery of housing is taking priority over additional institutional land uses,” they said, adding that it was “difficult” to provide details on short, medium, and long-term intentions of the Dublin diocese with respect to its sites.“However, it is clear that certain uses will, in the short and medium term, be no longer required, and certain buildings will no longer be fit for purpose. When this is juxtaposed against an express objective and desire by the Dublin diocese to assist in the provision of social and affordable housing across the city, a barrier to achieving this is potentially formulated in the context of the city development plan.”Íde Finnegan, the archdiocese’s head of operations, said the request to change the zoning did not mean that the church was working on plans to build housing on the sites.“There are no plans for any change of use, other than Finglas West,” she said in response to questions.Referring to the sites listed in the submission, Ms Finnegan said all were included because they had the zoning that was subject to the restrictions proposed by the council. “There are no particular plans in respect of any of those sites.”Church-owned schoolsThe archdiocese also listed numerous church-owned schools in Dublin, saying the submission was “applicable to these also” and asked the council to consider an “alternative zoning” across the sites.“These sites don’t have any long-term capacity issues, and don’t envisage a need for expansion of same in the long term. They are also not on any Department of Education Schools programme lists.”Asked about the inclusion of schools, Ms Finnegan said the statement that there were no particular plans “applies to the schools as well”.The archdiocese submitted a legal opinion by solicitors Mason Hayes \u0026amp Curran saying a proposed zoning change was an unlawful interference in religious and property rights because it would prevent housing being developed.“Overall, the changes will make it significantly more difficult to obtain planning permission for residential development,” said the lawyers.“There are many reasons why our client may need to obtain planning permission for residential uses on its land, and these proposed changes will make it very difficult to achieve. As such they are particularly discriminatory against our client, and will only serve to hinder the religious institutions they intended to protect.“For the reasons set out in this letter, the proposed changes are unlawful insofar as they affect religious institutions such as our client.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord the seanad where bilateral relationships begin","story":"Seanad Cathaoirleach Mark Daly is set to ‘begin hauling in the ambassadors at a terrific rate so they can witness him in the flesh conveying his best wishes to their respective countries on their national day’. Photograph: Tom Honan The Lithuanian ambassador was in the Seanad on Wednesday morning, much to the delight of the Cathaoirleach, who had been reduced to sending virtual greetings from the Upper House to their excellencies because of the Covid restrictions. Now that business has returned to normal, senators expect Mark Daly will begin hauling in the ambassadors at a terrific rate so they can witness him in the flesh conveying his best wishes to their respective countries on their national day. Cathaoirleach Daly has made it a feature of his tenure in the chair to mark these days, particularly when there might be an interparliamentary friendship group and possible bilateral visits in the mix. Ambassador Marijus Gudynas rose magnificently to the occasion by wearing a dickie bow in the colours of the Lithuanian flag during his brief visit to the distinguished visitors’ gallery, from where he was able to view the Seanad in all its underpopulated glory while Mark waxed lyrical above in the chair.The two countries have a close and friendly relationship, noted the Cathaoirleach, and last year 27 members of the newly-elected Lithuanian parliament (about 20 per cent of the total membership) formed the Group for Inter-Parliamentary Relations with Ireland. “We look forward to deepening the interparliamentary relationship with Lithuania and I wish the ambassador, all our friends in Lithuania and all Lithuanians, including those living in Ireland, and the Irish people living in Lithuania a very happy and safe Independence Day.”Senator Daly, of course, was building up to his trademark party piece in which he salutes the country in question in its native tongue. “Su laisvës diena, Lietuva!” he beamed, thrilled with himself. There were words of warm welcome from many senators as they spoke on the order of business, but none to top the contribution from Fianna Fáil’s Denis O’Donovan from west Cork, himself a former cathaoirleach. “I join in the welcome to the Lithuanian ambassador. I had the pleasure in my previous life as cathaoirleach to visit your country and I had, eh, an exceptionally good time there,” said Denis, placing particular emphasis on the “exceptionally” bit. “I won’t go into details, ambassador.” “The Cathaoirleach mentioned the Lithuanian community in Ireland,” he began. “And interestingly, I eat a lot of fish.” His excellency must have been wondering where this was going. We all were.“And the man who looks after my fish is a Lithuanian man – lovely man. And if I have a problem I ring him and he makes sure he has fresh cod, hake, or whatever is on the menu. The only thing I would say is that even though he is a Lithuanian fishmonger, the fish are Irish.”Independent senator Rónán Mullen welcomed the ambassador and commended his country for establishing an embassy in Taiwan. “Many of us support Lithuania in its dealings with China. It has set an example for other small countries,” he told his excellency. “As we say around here, ‘keep her lit’.”No doubt ambassador Gudynas enjoyed his short trip to Leinster House. Now everyone is wondering what country Cathaoirleach Daly will chose to honour next. New ambassadorsAs he was doing his thing in Kildare Street, fresh diplomatic meat was wandering into his orbit across the city in the Phoenix Park, where three new ambassadors presented their credentials to President Michael D Higgins at a ceremony in Áras an Uachtaráin. His excellency Sturla Sigurjónsson (Iceland), his excellency Gen Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda (Angola) and her excellency Saroja Sirisena (Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka) were received with the usual pomp and ceremony.Unfortunately, Mark has just missed Sri Lanka’s national day, which was at the start of this month, and he’ll have to wait until November if he wants to welcome Gen Geraldo. But Iceland has its day in June, albeit on a Friday.However, he might get a few pointers from Michael D’s event to liven up future little ceremonies in the Seanad. The three ambassadors were given a motorcycle escort to and from the Áras by a cavalry squadron detachment from Cathal Brugha barracks. There was a flag ceremony and an infantry battalion from Galway’s Renmore barracks provided a guard of honour. The Army No. I Band tootled away. Obviously, the Cathaoirleach would do away with the sizeable contingent of officials which attended from the Department of Foreign Affairs, including new secretary general Joe Hackett. Although an exception could probably be made in Gen Sec Joe’s case should there be a few bottles of prosecco left over in Iveagh House following Champagne-gate. Nor would there be any need for a Government Minister to adorn the Seanad’s souped-up national-day greetings gig (Minister of State Hildegard Naughton was on duty at the Áras). But maybe Daly could turn his episodic national-day gigs into a major pillar of the Seanad’s centenary programme, which kicked off on Tuesday. Michelin-star restaurantPerhaps ambassadors invited in for their national day could then be taken for lunch in a Michelin-star restaurant. Barry Ward, Fine Gael senator for South Dublin on Sea, was so pleased to see Liath in Blackrock bagging a second star that he had to convey his congratulations. Lawyer Barry knows his onions. “Obviously there’s a very small number of restaurants in this country that are operating at that level – only four, in fact, three of which are in Dublin but Liath is in the suburbs of Dublin, in Blackrock. It is, on the face of it, a modest restaurant, certainly a small one with, I think, about 20 covers but it operates at a level of excellence that is remarkable.”It’s all go in South Dublin sur Mer: “And as we see, Michael’s of Dublin moving to Blackrock. I hope it will be at the core of a foodie destination in Blackrock, the likes of which we have in Monkstown and other places in the Dún Laoghaire area.” Barry was using the royal “we” there. “Minority Voices, Major Change” is the title of the centenary programme launched on Tuesday to commemorate 100 years of the Seanad. Those senators who didn’t get the chance the previous day took the opportunity on Wednesday to declare how wonderful the launch of the Seanad 100 celebration had been. Joining in the congratulations was Fine Gael’s Seanad leader, Seán Kyne. “It was wonderfully choreographed and introduced,” he said, praising the Oireachtas team who worked so hard to put it together. “It was a wonderful start to a year of engagement and recognition of the role of the Seanad in this State,” said the former minister of state and TD for Galway West who lost his Dáil seat at the last election but found a berth in the Upper House.Fair enough.

A sailor with no facial features. A courtier with one red leg and one white.Nightmarish as these tableaux might sound, they derive not from a horror film but from the Bayeux Tapestry. Long regarded as one of the most important records of English history, the tapestry turns out to be riddled with errors.And these errors go beyond the famously ambiguous death of King Harold, who might be the soldier struck in the eye by an arrow, but who might also be the inidual slashed by a cavalryman’s sword and trampled underfoot.Mia Hansson, an amateur embroiderer from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, is six years into her project of making a full-size replica of the tapestry. The original, of course, is 230ft in length and tells the story of the Norman conquest of England, culminating in the Battle of Hastings and – spoiler alert – the victory of William the Conqueror.Thought to date to the 11th century, the tapestry has previously been hailed as “one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque” by Sylvette Lemagnen, author of the 2005 book La Tapisserie de Bayeux. Its status assured, Lemagnen says, by its “exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit.”Perhaps it is time to dock a few marks from this mainstay of British history teaching. Over the six years in which she has been painstakingly copying the tapestry, Ms Hansson has identified at least 15 mistakes in the original.They begin with the sailor, who has a rope running across the void where his face should be. They continue with a mounted soldier whose chainmail is rounded in the portion above his waist and square beneath it – a discrepancy that Ms Hansson ascribes to the tapestry being embroidered by two people at once. The errors continue with the men carrying the coffin of Edward the Confessor – look closely and you will see that there aren’t enough legs to go round.Given that Ms Hansson still has roughly another six years’ worth of work to go, we can safely forecast that more errors will emerge.But she is not amending them, despite her professional instinct – Ms Hansson, 47, is a trained primary school teacher – to correct. She is reproducing the tapestry, she says, “as faithfully as I can, because they did an enormous job. This is a masterpiece, this embroidery, and who am I to come and correct what they’ve done? I’m trying to honour it, warts and all.”That said, the errors can be frustrating. “This is going to turn my hair grey,” she said. “I’m working on a piece now where the back leg of a horse is just simply wrong.“There’s everything wrong about it and I have to copy that and it’s doing my head in.”Ms Hansson has also turned the tapestry into a colouring book. She will display the unfinished replica tapestry at St Peter’s Church Hall in Wisbech on April 12.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Skirmish near border raises fear of false flag attackBritons didn’t know what they were doing when they backed Brexit, says European ParliamentSydney shark attack victim named as British expat Simon NellistStorm Dudley: Travel chaos and thousands left without power - as even stronger Storm Eunice nearsThursday morning news briefing: Putin \u0026#39could drag out crisis\u0026#39Rust shooting: Animated video shows moment Alec Baldwin killed Halyna Hutchins on setMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eden project creator sir tim smit criticises cornish people","story":"As the creator of the Eden Project, Sir Tim Smit has had a transformative effect on Cornwall, bringing worldwide attention, jobs and a much-needed economic boost.But no good turn goes unpunished, it seems, particularly in a county where outsiders like Dutch-born Sir Tim are insultingly labelled “grockles” by some natives.For 20 years, Sir Tim has bitten his tongue as critics have railed against change, but he has finally let rip with an extraordinary takedown of locals who obsess about their “mums’ pasties” and romanticise “good old days” that never existed.In an expletive-laden rant, Sir Tim, who grew up in Sussex, accused Cornish people of defining their lives “in terms of what you don’t like” and of attacking entrepreneurs like Rick Stein who had helped rejuvenate their county.He told The Reason Why podcast: “One of the problems in Cornwall is, if you say anything – if you’re not Cornish – and you say anything about it, they say you’re an arrogant so-and-so speaking for the Cornish.“You feel, and I don’t, but you feel like saying ‘well if you were a bit more f- - -ing articulate you could speak up for yourself but you haven’t’.“You’ve all got mums who made the best pasties in the world and it’s fantastic and it’s fabulous, and you talk about the good old days, and the good old days never were the good old days.“They’ve been bad for about 70 years – and they’ve been bad because of t- - - - - s like you.”Sir Tim, 67, opened the Eden Project in 2000 after transforming an old clay pit near St Austell into a unique world of interlinking domes housing exotic plants from around the world. It attracts more than a million visitors each year and is reported to have contributed more than £1billion to the Cornish economy.Not everyone has welcomed the influx of visitors and cash, but Sir Tim said it was time they came up with their own ideas for taking the county forward rather than simply directing anger at those who are doing it for them.“His foundation was the fishermen of Padstow and him being a chef of fish.“He is personally quite anxious about being seen as a spokesman for Cornwall because he knows you get bricks thrown at you for saying you speak for anybody here.”Malcolm Bell, chief executive of the tourism body Visit Cornwall, said: “I suppose my reaction is I am a bit offended. The Cornish people are wonderfully warm and welcoming. It is regrettable because we are a community, we are a proud community. We know there are some strong views that most of us maybe don’t agree with and it does polarise people.“My view very simply is if you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all.”On Wednesday, Sir Tim apologised for the comments. In a statement, he said: “I’m sorry that some of the comments I made in the podcast have caused offence. “I hope that when people listen to the whole piece they will realise that I was speaking in the context of defending my friend Rick Stein and my strongest words were directed at people who seek to damn him for making Cornwall attractive to outsiders.“I wasn’t intending to comment on Cornish people as a whole, rather some of those who would tell you that the past was better than now when the truth is different it was not.“Cornwall has been my home for more than 30 years and I don’t want  a few harsh words on my part to damage the many friendships I’ve made in a place I love.  “My comments in the round are extremely pro-Cornwall and the rightness of anger at the neglect of this special place  - and an encouragement not to attack the wrong targets.”The podcast was hosted by Cornish actor and musician Seamus Carer, who said: “I’ve tried to make a balanced, nuanced piece of journalism about Cornwall, from the point of view of someone who grew up and still lives here. With that in mind, I’m extremely grateful to Tim for giving me his time and opinions.“I’m a big fan of empathy, so can see where Tim’s coming from whilst also understanding the anger that some listeners have voiced. It’s good to remember that Tim’s made big things happen in Cornwall, which many people have benefited from. He’s a canny businessman, with a confident style. He’s always been very supportive of my work and is a family friend.“However, I’m aware that some people feel distrust and animosity towards him, hence why he was such an important figure to interview. The overall aim of the podcast was to look at issues in contemporary Cornwall and to try to understand both sides of the argument. There’s no simple answer to any of it, but having dialogue and listening is certainly a good start. That’s all I tried to do.”More from NewsBritons didn’t know what they were doing when they backed Brexit, says European ParliamentRussia-Ukraine crisis: Skirmish near border raises fear of false flag attackSydney shark attack victim named as British expat Simon NellistStorm Dudley: Travel chaos and thousands left without power - as even stronger Storm Eunice nearsThursday morning news briefing: Putin \u0026#39could drag out crisis\u0026#39Rust shooting: Animated video shows moment Alec Baldwin killed Halyna Hutchins on setMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hms queen elizabeth inside aircraft carrier royal navy flagship","story":"The yellow-helmeted flight deck officer leans into a 40-knot wind and raises a small green flag in his right hand. I crouch behind him, clutching my robust but battered high-def camera. A few feet away, a snarling F-35B Lightning Stealth Fighter, sleek as a shark and every bit as lethal, prepares to launch into the steel-grey skies of the eastern Mediterranean.On the bridge, the navigators steer directly into the wind. ‘Steady on designated flying course, one-one-zero,’ says the officer of the watch.  ‘Steady on one-one-zero, sir,’ confirms the helmsman.The F-35B needs plenty of headwind to get airborne. The aircraft has a run-up of only 350 feet to the curved ‘ski-jump’, from which it will make its final leap skywards. Inside the glass-encased flight control tower behind us, the vessel’s Commander Air, Ed Phillips, aka ‘Wings’, looks up and down the massive flight deck and, when satisfied all is clear, gives a short sharp order:All eyes turn to the green flag held aloft and rippling in the wind. Probably worth no more than a couple of quid, it is brought down to the ground with a dramatic flourish the signal for the F-35B, worth well over £100 million, to get airborne.I brace myself for the immense power about to be unleashed. I’ve witnessed this many times and know what to expect. It’ll be exhilarating, for sure, but also terrifying and probably painful. I’m determined to capture on film a spectacular close-up of a launch as near to the aircraft as possible, but the timing is critical and so far I’ve manifestly failed to pull it off.The searing blast from the rear jet nozzle has always blown me off my feet and sent me sprawling. I have the bruises and cuts to show for it and God knows how much skin I’ve now invested in the roughened, diamond-hard surface of the flight deck. But I still don’t have the footage I want. This time, two hefty sailors are ready to hold me down, or at least try to. My fear is that no amount of muscle power will be a match for the explosive thrust of what is essentially a horizontal rocket.The pilot releases the brakes and opens the throttle. The Pratt \u0026amp Whitney afterburning, turbofan engine raises its pitch to a terrifying scream as the aircraft surges forward. I clench my teeth, tense my muscles and, with my heart pounding in my ears, bear hug the camera in a semi-stable position. But how long can I hold on? Four vice-like hands press down on my hunched shoulders.It’s June 2021 and I’ve joined the ship’s company of HMS Queen Elizabeth for her first operational deployment. We are some weeks into a seven-month voyage to the South China Sea, not on exercise but, locked, loaded and ready for action, should it become necessary.The new carrier and fleet flagship, together with eight escorts (destroyers, frigates, supply ships and a submarine) comprise Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) – the most powerful naval force to leave the UK in a generation. Prior to our transit through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, on our way to the Pacific and the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the ship has been launching waves of jets on Operation Shader – in support of land forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. But this has prompted a reaction from the Russians. They consider this part of the Med their own backyard and are intent on letting the QE and her escorts know they’re not welcome here. But the QE is the new dog on the block and she’s here to mark her own territory, not with a wag of the tail but a snarl.Today’s launch of the F-35s, therefore, is not to attack IS but to ward off Russian warplanes attempting to overfly us. Pilots, drawn from the Fleet Air Arm, RAF and US Marine Corps, have been scrambling all day, sometimes in rapid two-minute intervals, to intercept ‘red bandits’ and escort them away at a safe range.The Russians, apart from wanting to goad the Royal Navy, are desperate to get a closer look at the QE, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the world, and also test the Task Group’s reaction procedures – not only in the air but also on the surface, with their warships, and underwater with their submarines. The QE’s Anti-Submarine Warfare Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron are on constant patrol in order to monitor subsurface incursions and react accordingly. Nobody has actually opened fire, but there’s a lot of posturing and tactical lip-curling. If this is the start of a new Cold War, nobody is in doubt that things could heat up very quickly. The QE’s magazines are bursting with bombs, bullets and missiles of all descriptions and capabilities, as you’d expect on a warship that is now Britain’s main conventional strategic deterrent.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, leading CSG21, knows that Britain’s potential adversaries, the Russians and Chinese, will prod and poke his Task Group at every opportunity. ‘They want to see what we’re made of,’ he freely admits. ‘And I’m happy to show them, but professionally, in a spirit of confidence, not confrontation.’ Moorhouse is a steely commander but also a diplomat by default. After all, HMS Queen Elizabeth, a chunk of British sovereign territory, is part warship, part floating embassy. As the embodiment of ‘Global Britain’, her charge is to deliver ‘power projection’ on behalf of the nation: on the one hand that means hard-edged, lethal warfare on the other it’s about soft, political persuasion through deterrence, as well as overt support for allies around the world.Friends and foes alike will be watching this deployment with keen interest and I’m here to capture it on film for a forthcoming BBC TV series. But this isn’t the first time I’ve filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth. That was back in 2009, when I witnessed Princess Anne cutting the ship’s first steel at Govan shipyard in Glasgow. This was not so much the birth of Britain’s biggest-ever warship – more like her conception – and I was struck by the enormity of the occasion.  Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord at the time, spoke with passion to the audience and assembled media. The Queen Elizabeth Class of aircraft carrier, comprising HMS Queen Elizabeth, with HMS Prince of Wales to follow, would, he explained, ‘provide Britain with the means to deliver air power from the sea, wherever and whenever required, and in a stronger and more decisive form than ever before’. They will also, he added, ‘be the centrepiece of Britain’s military capability for many years to come’.The construction of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship meant a complete reinvention of the Royal Navy but, despite Sir Jonathon’s upbeat messaging, it was to prove a painful and long-drawn-out process. Our active carriers at the time, Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible, were about to be axed in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and with them the Navy’s Harrier squadron – its entire naval fixed-wing capability. Already, naysayers and vocal critics were provoking a heated debate over the pros and cons of a carrier-centric Navy, and whether there’d be enough escort ships to protect the carriers while at sea or sufficient sailors to man them – each would be three times the size of the Invincible Class carriers.General Sir Peter Wall, former head of the British Army, described the decision to build the new carriers as no more than a ‘vanity project’ that ‘lacked credibility’ and which could be seen to have ‘skewed the UK’s conventional defence effort to a damaging degree’. Max Hastings, ever the provocateur, suggested the new warships represented delusions of grandeur for a Navy in decline. Other denigrators were quick to point out that a large carrier is a big target – especially for the new generation of hypersonic missiles that the Chinese call ‘carrier killers’.Russia inevitably chimed in with some of its own political trash talk: ‘Just make sure you keep your new carrier away from Moscow’s warships or they’ll send it to the bottom of the sea.’Military hardware is an emotive subject, especially in the context of huge capital expenditure that might otherwise be spent on housing, welfare or the NHS, but £6 billion for two vessels (albeit a near doubling of the original budget) is modest compared to the eye-watering price tag of USS Gerald R. Ford, an American super-carrier of similar proportions which cost more than $13 billion (and which, according to the Pentagon, ‘has yet to demonstrate it can effectively defend itself from anti-ship missiles and other threats’).The glossy brochure issued by a conglomerate of shipbuilders known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance certainly suggested that Britain was getting its money’s worth. At 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales would not only be the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, but also the most powerful and advanced in terms of military technology and stealth capabilities – especially when married eventually to the state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning jet fighter.The sales pitch for the super-carriers came with a staggering array of facts and figures. The ships, it claimed, would be so highly automated they’d require only ‘lean-manned’ crews – less than 1,000 per ship, without aircrew. That’s broadly one fifth the size of an American crew on a similar-sized ship. They’d each have a four-acre flight deck, the size of three and a half football fields, nine decks and a hangar big enough to fit two Type 23 frigates side by side. Each carrier would have two propellers weighing 33 tonnes – exerting the same thrust as 50 high-speed trains and producing a maximum speed in excess of 27 knots (31mph). The six engines (two mighty gas turbines and four diesels) would produce enough energy to power a city the size of Swindon the electrical cabling and wiring would stretch six times round the world the ship, weighing the same as 35,000 family cars, would carry enough fuel to take those cars to the moon and back a dozen times… and on it went.The statistics were mind-boggling, but one thing was for sure: the challenge of building the first of these ships – the nine-decked HMS Queen Elizabeth – manning her, taking her to sea and getting her battle-ready was going to be a compelling story, as I learnt while following her construction in seven shipyards around the UK, culminating in her final assembly at Rosyth in Fife, like some gargantuan Lego toy. But, engineering aside, I knew that her real story would reside in the sailors yet to arrive the men and women who would breathe life into the country’s first super-carrier.  Foremost among them was Jerry Kyd, the ship’s first seagoing captain. I encountered him on the day he arrived in Rosyth in May 2016, as he addressed a fledgling ship’s company of just 456 sailors standing in front of their ship, still an inert hulk without propellers and dead in the water.‘The world’s a frisky place at the moment,’ he said. ‘And we have to be ready to respond to threats which I think are coming sooner rather than later.’ Kyd glanced towards their future home, encased in scaffolding. ‘HMS Queen Elizabeth, as big and sophisticated as she might be, is really just a huge metal box, full of pipes, wires, gadgetry and computer terminals. She’s missing one vital ingredient…’ He paused dramatically. ‘Without the flesh, blood, muscle and hearts of you, my sailors, that ship is just a robot. You, not the ship, are the most important resource at my disposal.’It was nearly a year before the QE was ready for her first sea trials. As a ‘new build’, there were bound to be problems. On the eve of our departure for the North Sea, Captain Kyd warned that there would be emergencies: ‘We’ll have floods, we’ll have fires. And casualties too. That’s the nature of this business.’For the best part of two months the ship was put through her paces off the coast of Scotland, where I joined them. The first aircraft, a Merlin helicopter, was landed on the flight deck within four days as the ship’s company got used to their largely subterranean existence deep in the belly of the beast. I watched with amazement as the sailors, many of them straight out of training, transformed the massive grey hulk not only into a working warship but a home from home. The QE was fast becoming a vibrant floating city and, with 23 nations represented from across the Commonwealth, all human life was here. My first challenge, however, was to learn my way round a ship longer than the Houses of Parliament and taller than Nelson’s Column and so gigantic that it boasted five kilometres of passageways and 3,200 compartments.Apart from a serious issue with a cracked thrust block that held one of the drive shafts in place, all went as well as could be expected. As Jerry Kyd foretold, there were plenty of fires and floods as the ship was pushed to breaking point so that her technical and seagoing limits could be identified. There were ‘casualties’ too, but thankfully only minor ones – the worst being cracked teeth and broken fingers. Sea trials completed, we finally entered Portsmouth dockyard, the ship’s designated home port, and within months the QE was officially commissioned by the Queen.After a period of maintenance, the ship set off for the next vital stage of her trials off the eastern seaboard of the US. Within hours of leaving Portsmouth we became aware of an ominous presence – a Russian Federation frigate called Admiral Makarov had closed to within two miles of our position. A highly capable warship armed with Kalibr long-range cruise missiles, the Makarov was in transit from the Baltic to Sevastopol on the Black Sea. While officially permitted to route through the English Channel she had clearly erted her course to have a closer look at our ship.  A few days later, just before starting our transatlantic crossing, we were suddenly erted into the Irish Sea to help chase off a Russian submarine spotted in British territorial waters. There was an increasing concern, as there still is, that Russians could be sussing out British underwater power and communication cabling – an obvious target for a potential enemy.  The Russian sub made a run for it as soon as we got close. Even before the QE had become operational the writing was on the wall and it was written very clearly in Cyrillic script. A sign of things to come (and indeed I write this as the world tries to second-guess Russian designs on Ukraine).Following this brief ersion we progressed across the Atlantic and the next dramatic event I witnessed was the ship’s first-ever run ashore in a foreign port, which didn’t go entirely to plan. In Mayport, Florida, after a night of heavy drinking, four sailors from the QE and two from our escort frigate, HMS Monmouth, were arrested for a range of alcohol-related offences including jaywalking, fighting and resisting arrest. Despite making headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, the episode was soon forgotten and at least part of the blame was attached to overzealous policing.  Captain Kyd, a pragmatist, reckoned that a night in jail was punishment enough for sailors letting off steam. ‘The question we have to ask ourselves,’ Kyd told his commanders, ‘is what sort of sailor would we want to go to war with? The automaton who obeys every rule, plays it safe and never takes chances? Or the free spirit who pushes his luck and breaks the odd rule?’    Kyd quickly refocused on the job in hand – namely to see an F-35B Lightning jet land on the ship’s flight deck for the first time. Helicopters were one thing, but a fighter jet that lands vertically using immense downward thrust from its enormous engine was quite another. Commander Nathan Gray, the Navy’s top test pilot, was the first to attempt a landing. It went without a hitch, although many questions remained about safety margins before the flight deck and aircraft could be handed over to front-line combat pilots. Two months of continuous, painstaking testing in all weathers, including a full-blown hurricane, gradually provided the answers. Gray, despite a few near misses, was satisfied that he and his colleagues had done all they could to ready the ship and aircraft for action.  And so to the present. Here I am aboard the QE once again – no longer on sea trials, but busy arm-wrestling the Russians, and before long she’ll be playing cat-and-mouse with the Chinese in the South China Sea. This is the acid test, with much at stake. The Prime Minister has declared he wants the Royal Navy to be the most powerful and influential in Europe by the end of the decade. CSG21 is the first step to achieving that ambition and proving that the new aircraft carrier is no white elephant but an effective instrument of government as well as an iconic symbol of nation.  Great adventure beckons and, once again, all life is here – a much expanded ship’s company of 1,650 men and women. Yes, there are the aviators yes, there are the seafarers yes, there are the marine engineers. But there are so many others: stewards, chefs, medics, gunners, aircraft handlers, writers, warfare specialists, physical trainers and intelligence officers. There is even a specialist chocolatier and, maybe because of him, a dedicated dentist and dental hygienist.‘Bleeding frozen chips!’ shouts Ronnie Lambert, an Essex boy, born and bred. ‘They want 10 more boxes in the main galley and they’re all at the back of the frickin’ fridge.’‘Well, get in there and pull ’em out,’ laughs fellow storeman Aaron Mackin. ‘It’s yer bleedin’ job.’‘Well, I’m transferring to aviation! Them boys have it easy up there. All sunshine and sea.’    The F-35B, accelerating from a standing start, rattles my bones. The heavyset sailors push down hard on my prone body as I attempt to point the camera in the right direction. The sailors are now lying on top of me – the jet stream strikes and skittles us. I roll across the deck, trying to protect my camera. Did I capture the moment of take off? I will check as soon as I can. Lying on my back I look up to see five British F-35s close in on three Russian MiGs.There will be more Russian warplanes soon. They’ll keep coming, but at least we know one thing: we have chips to go with our fish tonight. Must be a Friday.More from NewsStorm Dudley: Travel chaos and thousands left without power - as even stronger Storm Eunice nearsBritons didn’t know what they were doing when they backed Brexit, says European ParliamentRussia-Ukraine crisis: Skirmish near border raises fear of false flag attackSydney shark attack victim named as British expat Simon NellistThursday morning news briefing: Putin \u0026#39could drag out crisis\u0026#39Rust shooting: Animated video shows moment Alec Baldwin killed Halyna Hutchins on setMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"met launches cash for honours investigation prince charless","story":"Prince Charles has said he is willing to speak to detectives after Scotland Yard announced it had launched a criminal investigation into an alleged cash for honours scandal involving one of his closest confidants.The politan Police is examining claims that Michael Fawcett, his former right-hand man, had worked with fixers to secure a CBE for the Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, who had given more than £1.5 million to the Prince’s Foundation charity.The Prince of Wales, who presented Mr Mahfouz with the honorary title at a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 2016, has denied any knowledge of the alleged deal.Royal sources have said Prince Charles is willing to speak to police in order to help with the investigation.“There has been no request for help from the police so far, but if he is asked to help he will of course do so,” the source said. A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.”Scotland Yard confirmed it had launched a criminal investigation into the allegations, which first appeared in the media last year.The Prince\u0027s Foundation is an educational charity established in 1986 which brings together a number of projects and causes that Prince Charles is passionate about.The allegations centered around claims that Mr Mahfouz, who denies any wrongdoing, donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles.Mr Fawcett - who has been a close aide to the Prince for more than 40-years - resigned as the chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation charity in the wake of the allegations.Detectives liaised with the officials from the Prince’s Foundation after Norman Baker, the former Liberal Democrat MP, made a formal complaint to Scotland Yard.In December, the Prince’s Foundation published the findings of its own investigation into the allegations, which stated there was some evidence of communication between the CEO and fixers regarding honorary nominations for a donor between 2014-18.But the report stated it had found no evidence that the charity’s trustees were aware of this.The police investigation is being led by the Met\u0027s Special Enquiry Team, the same unit that is in charge of the Partygate investigation.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: The politan Police Service has launched an investigation into allegations of offences under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925.The decision follows an assessment of a September 2021 letter. This related to media reporting alleging offers of help were made to secure honours and citizenship for a Saudi national.The Special Enquiry Team has conducted the assessment process which has included contacting those believed to hold relevant information.Officers liaised with The Prince’s Foundation about the findings of an independent investigation into fundraising practices. The Foundation provided a number of relevant documents.These documents were reviewed alongside existing information. The assessment determined an investigation will commence. There have been no arrests or interviews under caution.A spokesperson for The Prince\u0027s Foundation said: It would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation.More from NewsBritons didn’t know what they were doing when they backed Brexit, says European ParliamentRussia-Ukraine crisis: Skirmish near border raises fear of false flag attackSydney shark attack victim named as British expat Simon NellistStorm Dudley: Travel chaos and thousands left without power - as even stronger Storm Eunice nearsThursday morning news briefing: Putin \u0026#39could drag out crisis\u0026#39Rust shooting: Animated video shows moment Alec Baldwin killed Halyna Hutchins on setMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"relocate england scots vote independence says head major defence","story":"The head of a major defence firm has warned his company could relocate to England if Scots were to vote for independence.David Lockwood, the chief executive of Babcock, said its huge fabrication yard at Rosyth could move south within three years if the firm was made to feel unwelcome after a referendum.Unionists said the intervention showed that major employers would desert the country if Nicola Sturgeon delivers on her plan of winning a referendum next year.Mr Lockwood, speaking to The Courier after Boris Johnson visited Rosyth in Fife this week, said Babcock could “manage” the break up of the UK but suggested this could involve relocation.Almost 800 skilled engineers are employed at the site, one of the largest waterside manufacturing and repair facilities in the UK.“I think in reality there will be plenty of warning if the vote were in favour of independence,” Mr Lockwood said.“There would then be a negotiation period and at the end of the negotiation period there would be an implementation period. So I don’t think there is anything that we can’t manage as a company.”He added: “If we had to replicate this in England because we were told we weren’t welcome here – which I think would be a bad mistake for Scotland – but if that were the decision, we can replicate this in three years, and the time window of negotiations is longer than that. It’s not ideal but it is manageable.”SNP figures responded by insisting that Babcock would be welcome in an independent Scotland. However elements within the independence movement, including the Scottish Greens who are in a coalition government with the SNP, have condemned Scottish-based defence firms as “arms dealers who profit from delivering death, destruction and misery”.Ms Sturgeon has insisted she intends to hold a new vote on independence by next year, although there are major doubts over whether she will be able to deliver.However, Mr Lockwood also warned that the ongoing constitutional debate alone was putting firms off investing in Scotland.“I think if you are already here it is manageable,” he said. “But I think it is a slightly different question if you weren’t here, does it affect your decision?“I am aware of people who are … it is a question they ask when they are making a decision where to base themselves.”Douglas Chapman, the SNP MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, said he was “disappointed” with Mr Lockwood’s remarks. “As the local MP I have consistently supported Babcock and the Rosyth workforce,” he said. “They make a very valuable and significant contribution to our economy. “They operate and are welcomed in many independent countries globally. An independent Scotland will be no different.”Stewart McDonald, the SNP defence spokesman, said the firm was “not just welcome, but vital”.He added: “Babcock is not just an important employer, but would play a crucial role in an independent Scotland’s defence capability.”More from NewsStorm Dudley: Travel chaos and thousands left without power - as even stronger Storm Eunice nearsBritons didn’t know what they were doing when they backed Brexit, says European ParliamentRussia-Ukraine crisis: Skirmish near border raises fear of false flag attackSydney shark attack victim named as British expat Simon NellistThursday morning news briefing: Putin \u0026#39could drag out crisis\u0026#39Rust shooting: Animated video shows moment Alec Baldwin killed Halyna Hutchins on setMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secrets number 10 front door","story":"As with so much to do with 10 Downing Street right now, establishing the facts about its famous front door isn’t always as straightforward. A  reader wrote a Letter to the Editor this week, to correct no less an eminence than Sandi Toksvig on the question of why the zero on the threshold to the Prime Minister’s residence is skew-whiff.On the BBC’s brainbox television show, QI, Toksvig had explained that the 37-degree tilt to the left on the numeral ‘0’ in question “had always been” that way since what had hitherto been 5 Downing Street was redesignated 10 Downing Street in 1779.  But the letter’s author, Malvern Harper, who had trained as a sign writer in the 1960s, recalled that his tutor had told him the slant was because the number ‘0’ was actually a capitalised letter ‘O’ in the same unusual typography used on Emperor Trajan’s Column in Rome in AD113.Both explanations can be found in the many histories of Downing Street written since Sir Robert Walpole took up residence there in 1732 at the invitation of George II. And there is even a variation that suggests the official Department of Works, as a result of another round of austerity which coincided with the renovation of Numbers 10, 11 and 12 in the early 1960s, had simply run out of ‘0’s. In the spirit of make do and mend, they substituted a spare Trajan ‘O’ as the next best thing.Which account is right? Even as one who has experienced that frisson – as if a very small footnote in history – of stepping over the threshold, I’ve no idea. But I can report some other secrets that the Downing Street door hides in plain sight. The original six-panel Georgian door, made of black oak, was installed in 1772 when Lord North was Prime Minister, as part of extensive renovations that saw three Downing Street properties knocked into one of suitable grandeur. Its 1991 replacement is made of black gloss-finish steel, installed for added security after an IRA attack, when John Major was PM, saw a mortar land in Number 10’s back garden. (When it needs maintenance, it has an equally robust twin that holds the fort.)If you can see past the press pack regularly gathered outside, the eagle-eyed will notice that there is no lock in which to put a key, and no handle. This is a door than can only be opened from the inside, where – because the brass door bell to its right is for decorative purposes only – a security guard is on duty 247, watching security cameras so it can swing open as if by magic on cue to allow in prime ministers, ministers, monarchs and assorted visiting dignitaries.  Or, on occasion, fail to open: as once when the Blair family were briefly left stranded on the doorstep, or worse in 2016 when US Secretary of State, John Kerry, came for his first meeting with Theresa May and walked straight into the door.  For those wanting to find a more discreet way into 10 Downing Street – and I will leave it to your imagination why that might be necessary – there is a back door, which does boast its own keyhole. If only they could train Larry the resident Downing Street cat to make use of it.There is something solid, serious and stately about today\u0027s glossy black door. Back in 1908, however, Herbert Asquith decreed – at the instigation, it is said, of his wife, the celebrated wit and socialite, Margot – that black was passé. Instead it was given a lick of what historical paint consultants have suggested was either Brunswick Green or Bronze Green, as popular then with those in the know as gold wallpaper is today.  The experiment didn’t last. Asquith\u0027s successor, David Lloyd George, known for his colourful turn of phrase and private life, proved to be more sober and traditional when it came to picking paint.If you have ever wondered why those delivering petitions to the Prime Minister can’t just slip their bundle of papers through the shiny brass letter box, there is an easy answer. Despite appearances, it is not a letter-box at all, but a shiny brass plate simply made to look like one (for security purposes) inscribed with the words First Lord of the Treasury. When Sir Robert Walpole took on the house in 1735, that was his official title, though he was de facto Prime Minister. All his successors since 1905 have held both offices simultaneously. The original lion’s head door-furniture was made of cast iron, the essential ingredient of the Industrial Revolution that began in Britain. At the outset of the First World War, soldiers about to depart for the trenches are reported to have walked up Downing Street to touch the knocker for good luck. During the 1960 renovations it was replaced by a brass lion\u0027s head painted black with Downing Street now out of bounds to the casual passer-by, it is in no immediate danger of being rubbed off.There are other alternatives at hand. Close by is the original door, on display in the Churchill War Rooms, or else wander down Whitehall, onto the Strand and turn into Adam Street, where a near identical front door, with similar frame and façade around it, is available free of charge at Number 10. But position yourself carefully for maximum authenticity.

Mr Putin has deliberately provoked the Ukraine crisis with the aim of forcing the West to make painful concessions, such as denying Kyiv the opportunity to join Nato or withdrawing its military hardware from Eastern and central Europe.Yet, while the willingness of some Western leaders to maintain a firm line has, at times, been open to question, one of the more refreshing outcomes of the crisis is that the Western alliance has held firm. While French President Emmanuel Macron has shown an alarming willingness to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz seems willing to rule out any future possibility of Ukraine joining Nato, the bottom line remains that, to date, no meaningful concessions have been made to Mr Putin on either issue. Instead, the Western alliance continues to discuss ways of crippling the Russian economy if Mr Putin is foolhardy enough to activate his invasion plans, demonstrating a level of resolve that has caught many off guard.The refusal to budge on Nato’s right to choose which nations can and cannot apply to join has certainly placed Mr Putin in a quandary, and may well explain why Moscow’s much-vaunted march on Kyiv – which US intelligence agencies had predicted would most likely take place yesterday morning – has yet to materialise.With an estimated 130,000-strong Russian battle group still camped on the Ukrainian border, such an eventuality cannot be discounted, and British security officials, together with their counterparts in the US and Europe, remain convinced that the Russian leader’s ultimate goal is to achieve regime change in Ukraine through military force. None the less, following the Russian defence ministry’s decision to release videos earlier this week of heavy armour being redeployed to barracks, hopes are rising that all-out conflict may yet be averted.For Mr Putin, who has spent much of the past few months stoking the flames of his latest confrontation with the West, the prospect of the crisis being resolved without him achieving any of his stated goals will be hard to accept. The Kremlin’s frustration that events are not moving in the right direction certainly helps to explain Moscow’s almost hysterical reaction earlier this week when Washington’s predictions of a looming Russian invasion failed to materialise.“They were humiliated and defeated without a single shot,” boasted Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, adding that Russia’s failure to launch its invasion according to the CIA’s precise timetable “will go down in history as the day when Western war propaganda failed”.It still remains to be seen whether the West has badly misjudged Mr Putin’s intentions towards Ukraine, with the Biden administration continuing to warn that an invasion “remains distinctly possible”, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirming that Kyiv has yet to detect any meaningful sign of a Russian withdrawal.Keeping everyone guessing is very much how Mr Putin likes to conduct business, so that not even trusted aides like Sergey Lavrov, his veteran foreign minister, can know with any certainty their leader’s next move. And if Mr Putin can keep his key Kremlin confidantes in the dark, then what chance do his Western adversaries have of ining his objectives?Yet, for all his mind games, Mr Putin’s prospects of achieving any tangible political gains from the Ukraine crisis grow more remote by the day, irrespective of the narrative the Kremlin’s “fake news” machine seeks to conjure up.The Russian leader will look weak and inept if he pulls back from a full-scale invasion without obtaining any guarantees from Nato on Ukraine, or winning concessions from the alliance on its future military dispositions in eastern Europe. Furthermore, his aggressive stance towards Ukraine has forged a new unity of purpose within the alliance that has been sadly lacking since the fiasco of last summer’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr Putin’s bellicose conduct on Europe’s doorstep has resulted in a significant uplift in defence spending among many member states, while previously neutral states such as Sweden and Finland are now giving serious consideration to applying for membership.If, by contrast, Mr Putin does press ahead with the invasion, he is unlikely to achieve a clear-cut victory. There is, for example, a growing consensus within Western security circles that the Kremlin has seriously underestimated the likelihood of Ukrainians launching a long and bloody resistance campaign, one that could ultimately prove very costly for Moscow.So, far from achieving a humiliating defeat of the West, as the Kremlin propaganda machine would have us believe, it is Mr Putin who has most to lose, whether he decides to invade or not.More from NewsBritons didn’t know what they were doing when they backed Brexit, says European ParliamentRussia-Ukraine crisis: Skirmish near border raises fear of false flag attackSydney shark attack victim named as British expat Simon NellistStorm Dudley: Travel chaos and thousands left without power - as even stronger Storm Eunice nearsThursday morning news briefing: Putin \u0026#39could drag out crisis\u0026#39Rust shooting: Animated video shows moment Alec Baldwin killed Halyna Hutchins on setMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer hints labour could","story":"Exclusive: Keir Starmer hints Labour could stand election candidate against Jeremy CorbynEx-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has sat as an independent MP since being suspended by the party in October Labour leader Keir Starmer on the campaign trail Image: Rowan Grfiths   Daily MirrorByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Feb |comments Labour could stand a candidate against former party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer has signalled. The Labour leader said he was on a mission to prevent Labour being linked to anti-Semitism for good - and did not rule out putting forward a candidate in Mr Corbynaposs seat at the next election. Mr Corbyn was suspended from Labour in October  over his reaction to a damning report on handling of allegations of anti-Jewish hate within the partyaposs ranks.He has represented Islington North since  but he would have to stand as an independent candidatehe fails to regain the whip by the next election. Mr Starmer was pressed on his predecessoraposs future by the Mirror as he hit the campaign trail ahead of next monthaposs Birmingham Erdington by-election.  Asked how he planned to ensure Labour upheld the values he hoped to roll out across the country, Mr Starmer said: “I said I would tear anti-Semitism out of the party by the roots in my acceptance speech. “We have been doing that and we have made progress on it.”Pressed on whether that would include standing a Labour candidate in Mr Corbyn’s seat, Mr Starmer said: “Well, Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t have a Labour whip at the moment.“That’s the position he finds himself in, and it’s down to the response he made to the report on anti-Semitism.” It follows claims Mr Corbyn could be deselected by the party in his safe seat of Islington North, which he has held since .It is understood he plans to stand at the next general election, whether it is for Labour or as an independent candidate. Mr Starmer also promised he is taking allegations of Islamophobia as seriously as anti-Semitism. “There is absolutely no hierarchy here, he said. “We have to root out Islamophobia in just the same way as weaposd have to root out anti-Semitism. “And we do it with the same determination and energy. And Iaposm absolutely as prepared to take tough decisions on Islamophobia as I am on anti-Semitism.” Askedhe had spoken to Labour MPs concerned by the issue, he said he “talked to all of our MPs pretty well all the time but admitted it was harder to keep in touch during Covid.

I wanted him to see me go to Parliament, she told the Mirror. Imagine a poor family from the inner cities and watch their daughter go to Parliament - you donapost know what that means. “He worked so hard for me and my family. I just wanted to stand up and say, ‘This is for you’.  Ms Hamilton, , grew up in a tight-knit family without much money. We had a party when we got our first washing machine,” she recalled. It was magical.” She said not going to private school or possessing family wealth had been a driving factor of her career, from nursing through to politics. Ms Hamilton said she knew she might face challenges in politics as a black woman. Iaposve faced racism and faced issues where people have thought perhaps I wasnapost good enough to do it because of the areas Iaposve grown up in, she said. I remember once a senior telling meyou are going to achieve anything in nursing, you donapost just have to be as good as your white counterpart, you have to be twice as good.

Ms Hamilton said: Iaposm not gonna tell you Iaposm prepared. But what Iaposve seen over the last month or so, from the MPs that have come to Birmingham, is that they seem very supportive. And so all I can do is learn from people that have gone there before me. Just try not to make the same mistakes. AndI get it wrong, just work with the powers that be to look at the issues. As well as her strong work ethic, Ms Hamilton has beaming smile on her face that lingers through the interview and when speaking to locals. Asked what her secret is to looking happy, Ms Hamilton replied: Iaposve got a good husband who loves me, and has for  years. Iaposve got five lovely children who absolutely root for me, a really good extended family and a great network of friends. Chuckling, she added: And also Iaposm a beautul girl walking about!

Race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust was granted the declaration by Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt after a High Court hearing in December. The Good Law Project joined the Runnymede Trust in the action. The judges ruled that the Runnymede Trust had sufficient standing to bring a public sector equality duty challenge but GLP did not.The ruling centred on Mr Hancockaposs decision to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection in August  and ex-Sainsburyaposs boss Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHS Test and Trace in September . Lawyers representing the two organisations suggested that people outside the tight circle in which senior Conservative politicians and their friends moved were not being given opportunities. They said an unfair policy was being challenged. Ministers disputed the claims made against them. Jason Coppel QC, who led the two organisationsapos legal teams, told Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt that the challenge was based on equality legislation and public law. He said the Government had a policy or practice of making appointments to posts critical to the pandemic response without adopting any, or any sufficient, fair or open competitive processes. Mr Coppel said people less likely to be known or connected to decision-makers were put at a disadvantage. He also said the Government was failing to offer remuneration for high-level full-time roles and excluding all candidates who were not already wealthy or held other posts for which they would continue to be paid.  Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt said in a written ruling: It is the process leading up to the two decisions which has been found by this court to be in breach of the public sector equality duty. For those reasons we will grant a declaration to the Runnymede Trust that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the public sector equality duty in relation to the decisions how to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the NIHP in August  and Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHSTT in September . Dr Halima Begum, Chief Executive of the Runnymede Trust, welcomed the findings. She said: “The judgement handed down today by the High Court is incredibly signicant to the British people. It shows the importance of the Public Sector Equality Duty and its role in protecting the people of this nation from the closed shop of Government appointments, not least in a time of national crisis where people from our minority communities were dying from Covid in hugely disproportionate numbers. Mr Hancock’s spokesman said the judgement aposthe claim brought by Good Law Project fails in its entiretyapos, therefore highlighting the fact this group continues to waste the courtaposs time. He said the High Court ruling “states that aposthe evidence provides no support ... at allapos for the allegation that Dido Harding secured senior positions on the basis of apospersonal or political connectionsapos in the Government”. He said: They accept these aposwere urgent recruitment processes which needed to find highly specialised, experienced and available candidates within a short space of time. Letaposs not forget, we were dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic where time was of the essence in order to protect and save lives. Mr Hancock resigned as Health Secretary last year after admitting to breaching his own Covid guidelines by kissing an aide in his office.

He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - though it’s not thought this will actually happen next week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the comments Unions also fear the ability to claim Statutory Sick Pay from Day One of Covid isolation will be axed when current laws expire. And charities worry immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.Meanwhile Boris Johnson’s plan could kick vaccines for all children over five into operation, though the announcement of this looks set to be brought forward after Wales and Scotland both unveiled their plans in the last  hours.For holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation paymentor sick pay. Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Unions and Labour fear the right to claim Statutory Sick Payfrom Day One of Covid isolation will be axed.The £.-a-week payment is usually only available from the fourth day of illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day for Covid cases.But the power is contained within the Coronavirus Act , which could lapse in its entirety by the end of March. It is thought ministers may need to pass new laws to continue the ‘Day One’ SSP power, and they have not yet said whether they plan to do that. Sources suggested the issue was still being worked out. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady - who has long called for SSP to be increased and extended to more part-time workers - said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. “Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end next week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought next week’s plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axedFully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in next week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport is pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. However, it is thought there is only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, with health officials still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due next week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status is being considered by the government this week. An announcement is due on Monday.  Legal powers for councils will goThe legal change will also end remaining powers which authorities had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over fiveAll children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

A US senior administration official last night blasted Russiaaposs claim it was withdrawing troops from the border with Ukraine. They received a lot of attention for that claim, both here and around the world. But we now know it was , the official said. The anonymous official said Russia has increased its troop presence along the Ukrainian border by as many as , troops, with many of them arriving as recently as Wednesday. No details or evidence were given of how the US knew this to be the case. But the , figure was today backed by UK Armed Forces minister James Heappey. He said Britain has not necessarily been able to very the , figure, but warned imagery overnight showed a new bridge and a large field hospital and he was very worried. “Troop movements towards the border continue”, Mr Heappey told the BBC. For all the talk about de-escalation in Moscow, I’m afraid what we’re seeing in the opposite and we’re very worried about it.  He added: “All of the conditions are set, and from the moment President Putin takes a decision, it is literally just a matter of minutes before military effect could be felt in Ukrainian cities. “That’s dferent however to inevitability. I have a gut feeling because I’m seeing what I’m seeing, and I don’t think you spend that amount of money in putting that number of troops and planes and ships into an area unless you mean it.But I have hope that a diplomatic process can succeed, because the consequences of that not being the case are that tens of thousands of people could die.” The UKaposs Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull, the Chief of Defence Intelligence, added: Contrary to their claims, Russia continues to build up military capabilities near Ukraine. This includes sightings of additional armoured vehicles, helicopters and a field hospital moving towards Ukraineaposs borders. Russia has the military mass in place to conduct an invasion of Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned Moscow could drag out the crisis for months in an attempt to undermine Western unity.  Moscow denies it has any plans to invade, and Russiaaposs defence ministry said yesterday its forces were pulling back after exercises near Ukraine. It published video that it said showed forces leaving the Crimean peninsula. But Ms Truss said it was essential the UK and its allies not be lulled into a  sense of security, adding: In fact the Russian military build-up shows no signs of slowing. We must have no illusions that Russia could drag this out much longer in a brazen ploy to spend weeks more -not months - subverting Ukraine and challenging Western unity. This is a test of our mettle. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview on MSNBC on Wednesday that critical units were moving towards the border. On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said the United States estimated that , Russian troops had encircled Ukraine, an increase from previous estimates of about ,. Russia had said that its forces - part of a huge buildup that has been accompanied by demands to the West for sweeping security guarantees - were pulling back after taking part in exercises in southern and western military districts near Ukraine.  But NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said moving troops and tanks back and forth did not amount to proof of a pullout. Liz Truss will reaffirm support for Ukrainian sovereignty on a trip to Kyiv this week as part of efforts to deter a possible Russian invasion, urging Moscow to end its military buildup along the border. Truss will hold talks with Ukraineaposs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and will then deliver a speech in Kyiv where she will warn Russia it faces economic pain and global isolationit invades its former Soviet neighbour. In a speech in Kyiv, the Foreign Secretary will say the path of diplomacy remains openMoscow really does want a peaceful resolute to the crisis . We are ready to talk. But we are very clear -they decide to continue down the path of aggression, there will be massive consequences bringing Russia severe economic costs and pariah status, she will say. Following her visits to Ukraine and Poland, Ms Truss will travel on to attend the Munich Security Conference with other Nato foreign and defence ministers.  Russiaaposs deputy ambassador to the United Nations Dmitry Polyanskiy again dismissed the claims as fantasies by Western politicians. This is a very ridiculous situation, there has been hysteria, even hype, fanned for several weeks by our Western colleagues, he told ITVaposs Peston programme. They convinced each other and the whole world that Russia was about to invade, they were even naming concrete dates. So it happened in their minds, in their heads. Britain has already said it is doubling the number of troops in Estonia, with around  members of The Royal Welsh battlegroup heading from Sennelager in Germany and bases in Europe for the Baltic state, while  Royal Marine commandos are being despatched to Poland.  Four additional RAF Typhoon jets are heading to Cyprus to join Nato patrols over eastern Europe while offshore patrol vessel HMS Trent will shortly be joined in the eastern Mediterranean by HMS Diamond, a Type  destroyer. Meanwhile, so-called golden visas for wealthy foreign investors are expected to be scrapped by the Government amid concerns over links between Russia and the UK. Those eligible for the tier one investor visa, launched in , must have at least £ million in investment funds and have a UK bank account. It has been under review due to repeated concerns that the system could be exploited because not enough background checks are made on applicants. And the BBC now reports an unnamed Government source has confirmed the scheme will be abandoned in an announcement to be made next week.

New guidance published today says schools should avoid advocating for organisations with contested aims or views when teaching pupils about racism. Britainaposs imperial past must be taught in a balanced manner and teachers should avoid controversial theories about historical figures, it states. Children must be taught that racism has no place in society but campaigners such as Black Lives Matter could be considered partisan political views. The guidance tells schools to offer pupils a balanced account of opposing views and not to advocate for ideas such as withdrawing funding from the police.  It says: Partisan political views must not be promoted to pupils, including by encouraging pupils to support campaign groups advocating such views. Teachers discussing the decriminalisation of homosexuality are told not to present discriminatory beliefs held at the time in an uncritical way - and make it clear they are not acceptable today. Schools already have a legal duty to ensure political impartiality in the classroom and teachers are required to promote values like democracy and the rule of law. Teachers are banned from encouraging pupils to back a political party or candidate in an election. But schools are allowed to teach children about dferent political parties and views - as long as they donapost promote a particular ideas.The latest guidance comes after Mr Zahawi waded into a row over a primary school in Nottingham where pupils had written letters to their Labour MP Lilian Greenwood about the Partygate scandal. Labour accused the Education Secretary of playing to his own party with the new guidance, while union bosses warned it could limit teachers efforts to discuss serious subjects.Shadow Schools Minister Stephen Morgan said: This hopelessly thin guidance shows Nadhim Zahawi is more focused on playing to Tory backbenchers than on the real challenges facing our schools.Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: There is absolutely no need for new guidance on how to appropriately handle political and social subjects in schools. Very good guidance already exists and this is followed up and down the country. It has always been the case that educators take their responsibilities for teaching in these areas seriously and carry it out with considerable thought. “We note Nadhim Zahawi’s intention that he ‘does not seek to limit the range of political issues that schools can and do teach about’. But in practice his guidance will have the opposite effect.Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said young people were exposed to a swirl of misinformation online and schools needed to provide a safe space for discussions.  He said: The vast majority of teachers are very good at managing these discussions in a way that is balanced and impartial. We welcome anything which helps them to navigate this dficult territory. However, we are keen that this should not be over-prescriptive as it could have the unintended consequence of deterring open discussions.” Launching the new guidance, Mr Zahawi said: I know one of the reasons many teachers feel so passionate about the profession is the remarkable role they play in young people’s lives, helping them understand more about themselves and their views of the world. I don’t want there to be any barriers – real or perceived – to teachers’ vital work in this space, which is why I am reinforcing that no subject is off-limits in the classroom, as long as it is treated in an age-appropriate way, with sensitivity and respect, and without promoting contested theories as fact.

Norman Baker says Andrew has, over the years, pulled in money from shady sourcesPrince Andrew attends the annual Founders Day Parade at the Royal Hospital Cha in  Image: Getty ImagesByNorman Baker:,  Feb So Prince Andrew has finally paid off Virginia Giuffre, at a cost rumoured to be £million. That’s a lot of money to give to someone he says he has no recollection of meeting. So where’s all the money coming from  Well it’s not from his handouts from the Queen, who gives him £, a year. Nor is it from his annual £, naval pension. Andrew has, over the years, pulled in money from shady sources. His marital home, Sunninghill Park, sat unloved on the market, empty for years before being sold to the dodgy billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakhstan dictator for £m. Why would he pay £m over the odds and then demolish the house without even living in it   Another dodgy deal gave him a % commission for sending a couple of emails relating to a £.m Kazakh infrastructure scheme, though that one fell through when Kazakh soldiers killed a group of striking oil workers. But now he is clearly short of cash. He has had to rely on the tycoon David Rowland to pay off a £.m loan from Banque Havilland. No doubt the fact Andrew had hosted his son Jonathan at Buckingham Palace when he was trying to land a lucrative deal involving the Royal Estate did no harm. It seems clear that the Queen is going to have to bail him out. Most of us stop cadging off our parents when we are in our s, but not, it appears, the -year-old Duke of York. The Queen, of course, is fabulously wealthy. But noises from the Palace suggest she could fund Andrew via the Duchy of Lancaster, a sort of royal slush fund. The Queen already pays out her annual support to the Royal Family from this source and offsets these payments against tax. If she bails out Andrew this way, that will in effect reduce her tax bill and mean the public purse is part-subsidising Andrew’s shenanigans. That is outrageous. We need a clear statement from the Palace that no public money will be used for a payoff. It is also high time the Public Accounts Committee looked into the whole murky business of royal finances.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Forever tainted Andrew’s banishment from public le must be permanent after paying his sex abuse accuser a substantial sum to settle sordid charges he denied. Because the court of public opinion will reach its own verdict on the U-turning prince now commending the bravery of a victim, Virginia Giuffre, his team disgracefully accused of lying in a stomach-churning smear campaign. And hoisting the white flag over Buckingham Palace to avoid a court inquisition means a man who until yesterday considered it honourable to be the guest of a convicted paedophile can never openly clear his name.  The donation to Giuffre’s charity combined with avow to campaign against sex trafficking and that apology indicate who won. She did. He still lost. The question remains unanswered about what to do with befouled Uncle Andrew despite relief in royal circles an Emily Maitlis mauling with knobs on is averted in a New York courtroom. Sneak him into platinum jubilee celebrations and the Queen will besmirch  years to rehabilitate a favourite son who’d be safer for the family locked in the Tower. Stripping him of a few courtesy titles and recognising the armed forces want nothing to do with Andrew isn’t enough.  The riot act must be read to him and a public declaration there is no way back nailed to the gates of Windsor Castle. Andrew remaining ninth in line to the throne and continuing to enjoy the perks of royalty is an insult to all women. It also goes to the heart of the rottenness of a hereditary monarchy, permanently elevating one family over millions of better others.

A councillor described the report as deeply shocking and upsetting, the Manchester Evening News reports. On one occasion, inspectors say a child was put in harmaposs way by staff aposcarrying out cardiac pulmonary resuscitation on them when this was not necessaryapos. And, in a separate incident, staff at the home did not enter a childaposs bedroom for four months aposdespite there being evidence of flies and a pungent smell coming from the room and spreading throughout the homeapos.  The home, which we are not naming in order to ensure the anonymity of the children, has had its registration with Ofsted revoked, according to the report. Staff are not effective in supporting children’s health and well-being, it read. A spokesperson for Achieve, the firm which operates the childrenaposs home, said staff would work with Bolton council to investigate the incidents in Oftedaposs report. In the inspection report, which covers visits on January  and  this year, Ofsted inspectors Chris Scully and Michelle Edge wrote: The registered manager and staff have failed to meet the basic care needs of children. One child has been signicantly neglected and he has not bathed, changed his clothes or been provided with a home-cooked meal since he moved into the home in September . Adding: Staff are not effective in supporting children’s health and well-being. The registered manager and staff fail to take action when children refuse to take their medication.Another issue listed in the report involved a child who refused to leave the home during fire drills for over three months.Despite knowing this, staff failed to put systems in place to help the child in an emergency. The report added: Currently, only two members of staff hold a childcare qualication one of these is the registered manager. The staff team is very inexperienced to care for two very complex children. Staff have not been supported by the manager to safely care for these children. In response to the damning findings, Bolton councillor Adele Warren said the childrenaposs home in question was an example of a wider problem. The report is deeply shocking and upsetting. Children who have been through so much already shouldn’t have to go through that as well in a location which is supposed to be safe and secure, she explained. I appealed it at the planning committee and it was declined but unfortunately they then applied for a certicate of lawful development, which there’s no recourse to object to. I did write to Ofsted and asked them not to grant registration but unfortunately they did.  It’s a dficult subject because these are extremely vulnerable children and you have to try and find a balance between trying to do the right thing for everybody but in Bolton we have so many private children’s homes and only  percent of the children placed there are local children. This puts a massive pressure on the availability of homes for our own children and I believe it’s a national scandal what’s happening in the private care home sector and I think a lot of people are just in it to make money. Some children’s placements are £, per week so some organisations are making a hell of a lot of money on the back of vulnerable children. These children deserve the best and to not even have adults that are adequately trained to look after them, it’s just not good enough. A spokesperson for Achieve said: We have voluntarily revoked our registration after the incident that occurred in our care home and we are working with the Local Authority to investigate it further. A Bolton council spokesperson said the home had undergone aposdue diligence and all the appropriate checksapos to be registered with Ofsted initially and that regular independent visits took place.  They added: “Bolton Council are working with Ofsted, health partners, and the provider to review the service that was provided at the home and consider what could have been done dferently to inform practice. “Children placed in the home were removed as soon as concerns were raised, and alternative placements were sourced within  hours. “This case demonstrates a broader national issue of sufficiency, quality and capacity within the care system, especially as children with complex needs are discharged from hospital settings at short notice due to a reduced number of hospital beds. “Like other local authorities, we are working with national partners, and the Independent Review of Children’s Social Care, to address this problem and ensure there is a more robust approach to registering providers. “There is also a need to enhance the monitoring of the quality of placements for children on a regular basis.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsCare homesNursing homesChildcare\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And sources say it was the Queen and Prince Charles who p ut substantial pressure on the Duke of York to come to an out of court deal - said to be worth £million.The Firm is said to have wanted a settlement agreed so the case did not overshadow the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee year. Well placed royal sources said Andrew was under “intense pressure from the very top” to ensure a deal was done after a US judge last month rejected the duke’s bid to have the case dismissed. And itaposs not the first time royals including the Queen, Charles and Andrewaposs other siblings have put their foot down amid his legal troubles... Stepping back from public le  Itaposs long been thought that Andrew is Her Majesty favourite son, and sheaposs said to have had a far more hands-on relationship with when he was a child than his older brother Prince Charles. Royal expert Penny Junor once said: I think the Queen has always had a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Prince Andrew.But after giving a car crash interview on BBC Newsnight about his association with Jeffy Epstein, Andrewaposs royal role diminished as his mother approved him stepping back from public le and reportedly cancelled a milestone birthday party. In the days after the Newsnight interview was broadcast in , Andrew sensationally quit public le for the foreseeable future in a statement - approved by the Queen.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

He said at the time: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. Therefore, I have asked Her MajestyI may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. Birthday party axed Andrew celebrated his landmark th birthday on February , .But it was reported that the Queen cancelled a birthday bash she had planned for him and downgraded it to a small family dinner. The Queen hosted a lavish reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the Prince of Wales’ th birthday in November .But in the wake of allegations against him at the time, a similar party for Andrew didnapost happen. No way back In October, it was reported that Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Edward ruled out ato public le for Andrew during a get-together.According to the Sunday Times, a meeting was held in January , where Andrewaposs siblings were in agreement that their brother should never be allowed toto public le, an insider claimed. A source said at the time: “Nine months ago Charles, Anne and Edward had a meeting, a summit, and agreed there was no way back for him.” Titles stripped Last month, Andrew suffered another blow when he learned he was being stripped of his honorary military titles and royal patronages. He was said to be utterly devastated by his mother’s bombshell decision, which came after the Sunday People exclusively revealed Her Majesty would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been ed to The Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen. A royal source said: All of The Duke’s roles have been handed back to The Queen with immediate effect for redistribution to other Members of the Royal Family - will notto The Duke of York. The Duke of York will no longer use the style ‘His Royal Highness’ in any official capacity. Balcony appearance  However, itaposs not just since his legal battle that Andrew has seen other royals put their foot down when it came to him. In , the Queen was celebrating her Diamond Jubilee of  years on the throne - and an appearance by the royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony was planned.It was reported that Charles had a hand in the decision for only senior royals, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, to appear on the balcony - leaving Andrew dismayed.  Royal expert Richard Kay wrote in the Daily Mail in : For Andrew, according to one close figure, being excluded from the balcony scene was a sudden and totally unexpected demotion from front-rank to peripheral royal. It was ‘like a dagger to his heart and he hasn’t got over it’.But this was a dramatic statement of intent by Charles, who long ago decided that when he is king the Royal Family would be ‘slimmed down’. But as a friend of the Duke of York says: ‘The speed and suddenness with which Charles has acted has taken Andrew’s breath away. It’s dreadfully high-handed.’ Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.

While the nation’s affection for Her Majesty remains undiminished, the reputation of the Royal Family has been tarnished by Prince Andrew’s unsavoury court case. To add to the Queen’s woes, the politan Police has opened an investigation into claims Prince Charles’s charity offered honours to wealthy donors. Clarence House insists Charles did not know what was happening at his foundation and is not involved in its day-to-day running.

For the Royal Family to be hit by one scandal is unfortunate but to be rocked by two in as many days is deeply embarrassing.

It would be deeply unfair on her Majestythe year in which she marks  years on the throne turns out to be equally grim.  Paying the price Soaring inflation is another blow to households hit by sky-high fuel bills. Prices are now outstripping wages and the recent increases in pensions and benefits.

The government hopes to announce that an end to all Covid restrictions, including the mandatory period required for self-isolating, will be in place by the end of February.Parliament is currently on recess, but the Prime Minister is due to announce his plan for living with Covid when MPsnext week on Monday, February . Another change, this time to testing, is also likely to be announced. Boris Johnson looks set to unveil the change that could impact Brits up to £ at a time, as the UK looks to learn to live with the virus.So what is the change and why will Brits be charged   Will PCR tests be scrapped  Free PCR tests now look set to be scrapped and could cost people £they want to get their hands on one. The Living Safely With Covid plan is due to be published on February  and may well include the plans to scrap free PCRs.  PCR tests have been vital to determinea person has Covid, as they are more accurate than lateral flow testsand have become a requirement for travel to and from certain countries around the world at ious points during the pandemic. The hope is that LFTs becoming more widely available will mean PCRs will not be so heavily relied upon. Why are free PCR tests set to be scrapped   The Treasury will be hoping to save billions by announcing the end to free tests. Covid figures have taken a downward trend recently. The seven-day average has been falling since January .  However, UK Health and Security Agencywants the government to keep providing free tests until at least the start of April and some experts are also concerned that the changes will be taken as a signal by people with Covid that they should continue to mix in public setting, despite having clear symptoms of the virus. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said it has put him off visiting the establishment again.The customer, who wished to remain anonymous, contacted the takeaway to complain about the crispy foot find but he said they brushed him off and hung up the phone, North Wales Live reports. He said: I honestly didnapost even process it at first, I pulled out the first piece of chicken and took a bite. Following this I looked into the meal and noticed the oddly shaped piece, which made me put out what I had in my mouth in disbelief. As anyone would imagine seeing what I was holding on my hand really put me off the rest of my meal. I literally had to google chicken body parts to make sure I wasn’t telling myself it was what it wasn’t. But, then I knew and couldn’t continue eating the meal, I physically felt sick. After around  minutes of getting my head around what I had actually being served, I called the takeaway back and explained to them what had happened. I took photos and offered to send them to them to prove myself but they were having none of it. After trying to explain to them what they had served me, they just went silent, laughed, and then seconds later the line went dead”  He added: “I would have given them the benefit of the doubtthey had listened to me and took in what I was saying, and would have happily ed as a customer. I fully understand, they haven’t picked the pieces themselves and have just placed them in the fryer from a bag. The customer service really didn’t help matters on their behalf and the whole situation has confirmed to me that I will never enter the takeaway again, let alone order from there. This has put me off chicken as a whole, knowing that I could have eaten thatI hadnapost have noticed it. Chicken is no longer top of my choices of food, I would rather go withoutI’m being honest and will always opt for something the choices are there for me. Reporters contacted East Eat several times for a response and they have declined to comment.  The takeaway is currently awaiting afood hygiene ratingwhich is believed to have been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Although chicken feet are often discarded as a waste product in the UK, they’re common cuisine in ious places around the world, including Mexico, South Africa, Asia, Jamaica, and Trinidad, where you can find them as street food or a festive dish. Chicken feet are praised for their health benefits, which are mostly attributed to their high collagen content.

Curious Brits took to social media to share pictures of the distinctive pouch-like clouds, which one person likened to a painting.The phenomenon took place as mph winds lashed the country after the Met Office issued an amber weather warning for the north of the UK. Meteorologists have now answered Britsapos queries about the bizarre clouds that accompanied Storm Dudley. The organisation said the formations are called mammatus clouds. These clouds usually emerge after a storm has passed, particularly thunderstorms. They are named aposmammaapos, which means breast or udder in Latin, due to the apospouchesapos that appear underneath them. One awestruck Brit shared a snap of the clouds above the Scottish town of Clarkston, in East Renfrewshire. Another Twitter user, Claire Campbell, posted an image of the clouds above Glasgow. She said: I spotted these clouds during Storm Dudley today, at Silverburn ! Like a painting! Meanwhile Brian Morrison shared a video of the same aposweird cloudsapos above Glasgow. Another person wrote apos#StormDudley is doing weird things to the sky up in Edinburghapos and shared a picture of a red sky filled with mammatus clouds. Retweeting a video of the clouds, the Met Office said: Great Mammatus clouds from #StormDudley.The Met Office website states:are some of the most unusual and distinctive clouds formations with a series of bulges or pouches emerging from the base of a cloud. The shape of mammatus formations can y widely from the classic protruding shape, to a more elongated tube hanging from the cloud above.” The clouds are particularly eye-catching during sunsets, when they absorb the red light and take on a crimson colour. The formations came after Storm Dudley caused chaos across the UK, downing trees and knocking out power for thousands of households. Nearly , homes in Wigan, Greater Manchester, were left without electricity after strong winds caused an outage. Electricity North West previously warned the weather may damage overhead lines and the network operator has now dispatched engineers to fix the issue. The firm said power cuts have also taken place in towns and villages throughout Lancashire and Cumbria.  As of pm, Capel Curig in Wales had experienced gusts of up to mph, with Emley Moore in Yorkshire seeing mph winds, while Drumalbin in Scotland was hit by mph gales. Social media users shared images and videos of fallen trees, large waves smashing coastal areas, howling winds and rain sweeping through quiet roads and dark and gloomy skies, with some facing delays on public transport. Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst told the PA news agency: Weaposve seen Storm Dudley move in over the course of today with strong winds and heavy rain across northern parts of the country.

Exposed areas in Scotland, Northern Ireland, parts of Wales and northern England have seen wind speeds largely between  and mph but the worst affected areas have reached and even surpassed mph this afternoon. In terms of rainfall the highest weaposve seen in the past  hours is .mm in Low Laithes in west Yorkshire, which is a good amount for the time period.

In the footage Dean can be seen trying to act as peacemaker to defuse an altercation between his cousin Taylor Lock and another man outside the pub.The CCTV shows the moment that -year-old Silllence threw the “forceful, swinging punch” from behind, knocking Dean backwards without warning. He went on to assault Mr Lock.  Boxing enthusiast Sillence, from Bangor, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to  years in prison in December . He also admitted to assault causing actual bodily harm on Mr Lock. Deanaposs family took the incredibly dficult decision to share the moment Dean was killed as they step up their campaign for tougher sentences for single-punch killers. They have launched a petition, signed by more than ,, calling on the UK Government to change the sentencing for one-punch assaults so that it matches that for murder convictions.Deans’ mum, Becky explained why she shared the footage on Facebook : “I wanted to put it out there that when my son was killed there was no fight or words exchanged between Dean and Brandon.He was in fact trying to prevent a fight breaking out between his cousin and a friend of Sillence, she added.  “You can clearly see by the video that the police have released, that Brandon aposCowardapos Sillence punched my son from behind. “Dean couldn’t even see it coming, it killed him instantly because he hit him that hard and forcefully. “What sort of coward hits someone from behind and leaves him on the floor, then walks away knowing the damage he had done. She added: “How is this not an intentional act of violence to cause harm  To all that defended Brandon by saying it was a pub fight shame on all of you. “My son and nephew were attacked by this coward, Brandon.“As the judge said he was willing to punch his own shadow that night which resulted in my sonaposs death, and affected our family lives forever” Sillence was jailed a few days after the jury found him not guilty of murder but the court case and sentence was a huge disappointment to the family. While nothing will bring Dean back, his family hope to see change which would give others living with the consequences of a fatal punch a greater sense of justice.The petition set up by the family of Dean Skillin, and can be signedhere .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CCTV footageCourt caseMurder trial\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Vincenzo and Lisa Pranzo said their experience with United Utilities was a nightmare after they followed the advice of an employee which turned out to be wrong, they claim. They claim they were told aposyeah youaposve definitely got a leakapos. According to the family, a United Utilities inspector visited their Lancashire home on October , , and told Lisa that he was checking properties for leaks due to a recent spate of high water usage in the area. The inspector allegedly told Lisa she had a leak at the corner of her property near the house and said work needed to be carried out after checking the drive and surrounding areas of the property.She told Lancashire Live that when Vincenzo arrived home and had the situation explained to him, he said that in that specic part of the property there were no pipes, but the inspector reportedly assured them there was indeed a leak and he would investigate the matter. He said to us, aposyeah youaposve definitely got a leakapos, who am I to argue with someone who works for United Utilities and he is supposedly qualied, Lisa said. They came back and dug underneath the wall and thereaposs no water visible, but he listens and says aposyeah the leak is definitely under your houseapos so then obviously you go into panic mode. Heaposs explained to me, as the leakaposs under my property, United Utilities donapost fix it, Iaposm liable to fix that. United Utilities has said it is sorry Mrs Pranzo is disappointed with the service she has received and said it remains in contact with the couple. Their full response is at the bottom of this article.  The couple say they were given two options, they could dig a trench and get a stop tap with an insulated box fitted outside or pay £ for a company to use a mole - displacing the soil creating a bore instead of a trench. Days before Christmas, when the couple still hadnapost figured out how they would fix their leak, Vincenzo walked up to the top of the drive when his foot started sinking through the ground. As heaposs walking from the path onto the road, his foot almost sank into the stones- a sinkhole had kind of appeared at the front of the property, Lisa said.  Now we knew a pipe directly runs there because  years ago, the fitting that United Utilities used to branch it off from the supply blew and they had to dig it up and replace that. Weaposre thinking at the time, this is where the leak is, obviously thereaposs a large pool of water here. Looking to their eldest son who is a pipefitter, the family believed that the leak was due to a faulty pipe fitting. But, during a re-inspection, the couple were allegedly told that the leak was simply a random pool of water. Lisa said: He turned up laughing, heaposs not taking us on, heaposs telling me first, itaposs a random pool of water thataposs appeared- well Iaposve lived in this house for  years and Iaposve never seen, even in the most torrential rain, a random pool of water. My house is on an incline, the path is about cm higher than the front of the house. Heaposs then trying to tell me that the water thataposs pooled at the top of the path is due to the leak under the house. I said aposIaposm not being funny and Iaposm obviously not a plumber myself but water doesnapost run uphill.apos  Vincenzo and his son decided to dig up a hole in the path themselves to prove where the leak was coming from. Having removed all the water from the hole, they watched as the water soon filled the hole up once again showing that the water wasnapost coming from a source underneath the house but from the top of the driveway. Despite being able to show where the leak was coming from, Lisa says the inspector still refused to take on board what they had found, so the family decided to get Christmas out of the way and go back to the inspectoraposs original suggestion to dig up the trench in the new year. In doing so, Lisa says they would have been able to apply for the Lead Replacement Scheme which allows customers to receive a grant to pay for the replacement fixture. It states on the United Utilities website: Under the lead pipe replacement scheme, we may be able to offer a free like for like connection of a replacement water supply pipe , from your boundary to the water main in the road or footpath. Before going ahead, Vincenzo and Lisa asked the companythey were to dig, when would be the closest time they could come out and were told someone could come to replace the pipe in - days. My husband spent three weeks digging this trench that had to be cm deep and  metres long which is no mean feat in the freezing cold but he did it because there was going to be no other way we were going to be able to afford to do this, Lisa said. Then we got an email to say that it was now going to take - months to connect the water supply because there is a backlog at the council with applying for work permits. Explaining the severity of the leak and the now gaping hole across their drive, Lisa was able to arrange with the company for another inspection. The fella that came out, hats off to him - he was brilliant - I told him what the other fella had said and heaposs shaking his head, Lisa said. He said because lead pipes are such good conductors of sound, you could hear a leak right at the top and I could be hearing it from ,  metres down. He raised the job immediately and they were out the next morning- it took them an hour to dig down, find the leak which had nothing to do with my pipe, my pipe was fine. It was, as I said, the connection that United Utilities had put in - it was faulty, it was leaking - they fixed it. Although the leak was fixed, the trench was still there, which caused yet more problems for the family. During this time, Lisaaposs youngest, her -year-old son, badly hurt his foot on the rubble outside of their home and after an infection, he was put on antibiotics. He had to have adult antibiotics in tablet form and he couldnapost swallow them so we have to cut open the tablet to give him the power, Lisa said. The first two times he vomited in the kitchen floor because it was that bitter- he had to have that four times a day. While the cost of the job to repair the leak was covered by the company, Lisa said she rang up the customer service team hoping for some help with the trench they never needed to dig.  After  days of reportedly not getting a full response back, Lisa says she was told nothing could be done and she would have to fix the trench privately, with no option to speak to senior members of the team herself. Itaposs still not over because weaposre still arguing about it, Lisa said. Weaposve invested a lot of money in this house and itaposs one of the only things weaposve got of any worth and theyaposve made us do that to our home for no reason. The least they should have done is offer to help us put it straight - this is going to cost me money now for a skip, put the patios back and ordering sand and cement. My husband is working full-time and has to try and fit that in now around work- I just donapost think they understand what theyaposve done. He worked really hard and I feel for him, the words apos metre trenchapos donapost do any justice to the pictures and how hard he worked. Itaposs just been a nightmare from start to finish andUnited Utilities trained these people better who went round with these listening devices we wouldnapost be in this situation weaposre in now. Iaposve paid my water bill and I have been for the past  years to the water company, I am never late, Iaposve never once moaned or had a problem and I donapost get a phone call from the person who decided this.  United Utilities says their policy stands that private homeowners are responsible for the maintenance of water supply pipes that bring water into their homes from the mains on the street. Where customers have supply pipes made of lead, United Utilities advise them to replace them and there is a lead pipe replacement scheme the teams will point customers to where appropriate. A spokesperson for United Utilities said: We are sorry that Mrs Pranzo is disappointed with the service she has received. Whilst we will try to help customers when a leak has been identied on their property it is ultimately their responsibility to maintain the water supply pipe to their home. We are still in contact with the customer and we hope they will apply to our lead pipe replacement scheme that can help with grants for replacing lead supply pipes.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON United Utilities PLCCustomer service\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When Olena Veitaite was five months pregnant she and partner Michael Gapski were told their daughter would need surgery to repair her heart after she was diagnosed with a cardiac condition - an atrioventricular septal defect. Pola was born in June  with Downaposs syndrome and a hole in her heart.The family were referred to leading charity Rainbow Trust before her surgery at Alder Hey, LiverpoolECHO reports. Pola underwent her operation in January when she was six months old to repair the hole in her heart.  The operation was meant to last six hours, but after eight hours the doctor wanted to speak to the parents. Olena, from Blackburn, said: The doctor explained the operation had been very complicated and Pola had had dficulty breathing because of pulmonary consolidation, meaning there was some blood in her lungs. She had to spend ten days in intensive care, initially with an open chest and on breathing machines. It was incredibly hard.  It took  days for Pola to open her eyes as the mum said she cried tears of joy when her daughter appeared to be out of the woods. She added: On  January she opened her eyes. It was amazing and we cried constantly with joy. Gradually she became stronger and the tubes were taken out of her belly and step by step she was getting better. Since September  the family has been supported by Rainbow Trust Family Support Worker, Brodie Stockwell. Olena added: Over time we became more and more comfortable with Brodie and now she feels like a part of the family.When we were in hospital Brodie would accompany me on the ward as only one parent was allowed because of Covid-. I was sleeping at the hospital and only swapping with Michael so that I could eat meals. It was exhausting and having Brodie was such a support.On February , little Pola was finally able to come home. Olena said: As we opened the front door carrying Pola, Michael and I looked at each other and started crying with happiness and relief. We were so thankful that we were coming home with our baby. We love Pola so much and throughout it all Michael and I have always tried to keep positive and Brodie has been such a help.” Rainbow Trust supports families who face the very real possibility that their child might die. To mark the Trustaposs th anniversary they are creating a permanent presence in Liverpool to help families like Polaaposs. Rainbow Trust Chief Executive Zillah Bingley added: For several years we have been aware that there are a number of families in desperate need for the type of support Rainbow Trust provides in and around Liverpool. Rainbow Trust has supported families attending Alder Hey for treatment, like Pola’s family, but until now we have not been able to fund a new team in the area. Thanks to the incredibly generous donation from The Kentown Wizard Foundation this is now a reality. We look forward to working alongside the existing palliative organisations in the region to ensure that our new team can complement the existing support and together make sure that families receive the full care they require.

With his lawyers’ help he came across as a debauched, entitled social reactionary from the world of th century princelings that America cast off in . Andrew seemed to believe his rank made him unaccountable. And the aggression of his defence team in the New York civil action brought by Virginia Giuffre made it much worse. There was also a feeling in America that Andrew had already been judged in another court: The one convened by his own family.  Their draconian steps to strip him of his titles and banish him from public duties may not be trial by jury but it rang out clearly as an unequivocal condemnation by those who know him best. That does not, however, pacy federal prosecutors. They still want Andrew’s help in shedding light on the world of sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. By his own admission, Andrew had known and regularly met Epstein for two decades. In  the New York-based federal prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, said Andrew “sought to ly portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” in his investigation but had repeatedly declined to be interviewed. That was bad enough. But when Andrew’s legal team painted Virginia Giuffre as someone compromised by “her own wrongful conduct” rather than as one of the many victims of the depraved Epstein Ghislaine Maxwell menage, it reinforced a certain view of Andrew: That he was incapable of feeling any remorse for believing that he could circulate in that world without being tarnished by it.The Last Queen by Clive Irving is published in paperback by Biteback on Thursday, £..Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyCourt caseCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The investigation emerged amid calls for transparency about Prince Andrew’s £million civil sex case settlement. The Mirror can reveal the Queen helped Prince Andrew settle the claim by making a £million donation to his sex abuse accuser’s charity. But ­questions were still being asked about whether public money was used. Her Majesty was today seen for the first time since her Covid scare last week, at an engagement at Windsor Castle. Standing with a walking stick, she pointed to her left leg or foot, and said: “Well, as you can see, I can’t move.” Tonight a source close to Charles confirmed the future king is willing to speak to police to help the investigation. They said: “There has been no request for help from the police so far, buthe is asked to help he will of course do so.” The allegations centre around ­businessman Mr Mahfouz donating £.million to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles.  Mr Fawcett, who has since quit as chief executive of Charles’s charity, is alleged to have negotiated with fixers to secure a CBE for the Saudi who was said to be seeking recognition and residency in the UK infor financial contributions to The Prince’s Foundation. Prince Harry met Mr Mahfouz in  and was pictured shaking hands with the billionaire who donated £, to his charity.In December, the Sunday Times revealed that the pair met at a pub in Cha, West London, owned by Mark “Marko” Dyer, a former royal equerry known as Harry’s “second father”, who is said to have brokered the introduction in . They reportedly discussed Sentebale, a charity Harry set up after a gap year in Lesotho, Southern Africa. In response to the report, the Duke of Sussex issued a rare statement saying he had severed his ties with Mr Mahfouz. A spokeswoman for Prince Harry said: “The Duke and his advisers, as well as his nonprofit Sentebale, severed ties with Mr Mahfouz and his associates in , no longer accepting further donations to Sentebale and discontinuing any plans for a fundraising event amid growing concerns over his motives. “The Duke had one planned meeting with this donor nearly eight years ago, did not introduce him to any members of the Royal Family, and expressed concerns about the donor.”  Harry did not say what he believed Mahfouz’s motives were, or specy whether he shared his “concerns” with Charles or Clarence House. Despite the denials, former Met detective sergeant Steve Morris said: “Both Prince Charles and Prince Harry should be questioned without a doubt. “It is all part of the investigation, how the donor got to where he is within the charity, that is vital evidence to show the picture of how he has allegedly infiltrated the charity. “They should both be spoken to at the very least as witnesses. It would involve officers going to their address, or them being invited to a police station to give what’s called a Section  statement, purely as a witness at this moment in time.” Charles is president of the foundation but thought not to be involved with its governance or with trustees overseeing its day-to-day activities. A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.” Prince Harry could not be reached for comment. The Met is understood to have arranged an investigating team after pressure group Republic contacted Scotland Yard last September and reported Charles and Mr Fawcett on suspicion of breaching the HonoursAct . At the time Clarence House said the Prince had “no knowledge” of the alleged cash-for-honours scandal.Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt tweeted: “This has the potential to be very challenging for Prince Charles. For decades, Michael Fawcett was one of his most powerful confidants.“If their investigation is to be ­credible, the Met police will have to interview the future king in the same way they would any other citizen.”  Mr Mahfouz has previously denied the allegations. Scotland Yard confirmed a probe is under way, saying: “The decision follows an assessment of a September  letter. This related to media reporting alleging offers of help were made to secure honours and citizenship for a Saudi national. The Special Enquiry Team has conducted the assessment process which has included contacting those believed to hold relevant information. “Officers liaised with The Prince’s Foundation about the findings of an independent investigation into fundraising ­practices. The foundation provided a number of relevant documents. “These were reviewed alongside existing information. The assessment determined an investigation will commence. There have been no arrests or interviews under caution.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince HarryPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBBCBuckingham PalaceScotland Yardpolitan PoliceCharitiesRoyal FamilyBillionairesDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She said: I painted my kitchen in the first lockdown with a dark grey paint as I had seen other people do this but I loved the shaker style kitchens.

She continued: I was desperate to do my kitchen and after doing the hall I knew I could do my kitchen. So I contacted a local timber merchant and asked them to cut a sheet of MDF into mm strips, which meant it would cover all the old holes where the handles had been. I chose mm deep as I tried dferent depths of MDF and any thicker it would have caught on the door next to it.”  She cut eachwith a manual saw and asked her local timber merchant to cut a sheet of MDF into mm strips. Jill said: “ I did three light coats with a sponge roller. I used the Valspar v eggshell paint for wood and metal. “It was colour matched to Farrow and Ball Purbeck stone.” She then drilled holes for the doorknobs and replaced the door hinges with soft close hinges so they don’t bang when they close.Jill uploaded the upcycled kitche to her Instagram account which has received more than , views. She concluded: It cost me £ for the MDF, about £ for the primer and eggshell paint and about £ for the new handles and a couple of pounds each for the caulk and adhesive. I have friends who paid about £, at least to have their kitchens professionally painted and that didn’t include changing them with the MDF. People are frightened to try so my advice would be to try painting a little piece of furniture first to get used to painting oryou have a spare kitchen cupboard stuck in the loft then have a little practice on that. “Obviously saving the money is a huge benefit and that means I have that money to spend somewhere .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kitchen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

During the -minute lecture, which was organised by the National Education Union , Dr Barnes outlined how schools should be moving towards a ‘gender free model’. The charity leader told the group that her ideas were working well in schools where it had already been implemented. Barnes showed attendees a ‘code of conduct’ that she encouraged schools to display at reception. The poster listed bullet points of all the characteristics protected under the Equalities Act, apart from sex. Barnes suggested that the options of ‘male’ and ‘female’ should be removed from school application forms, with a box for gender simply ‘left open’ instead. One attendee reportedly argued that teachers ‘do not take offence’ from words such as ‘Sir’ or ‘Miss’, saying they are only used to ‘get your attention’.

According to the Manchester Evening News, one woman on Facebook said the cards were a great idea, and praised the supermarket for making braille cards - which are usually available from the Royal National Institute of Blind Peoplewebsite - more easily accessible.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Karen Davison wrote: What a great idea! Do they have braille birthday cards  I have a friend who is blind and this would be amazing. I know you can buy from RNIB online, but just asking. While Steph Laban loved the inclusive range, as she said: Love this. My daughter is fully blind and although she is only  at the moment, I love that she can now enjoy cards the way we do.There was also heaps of praise from Twitter users, including Simon Doherty who said Tescoaposs display was the first time heaposd ever seen braille cards.He noted: Fair play to Tesco, Iaposve never seen braille cards before.  Others called the push to sell accessible braille cards an amazing initiative, and said itaposs something that should have hit shelves years ago. The RNIB confirmed the range of cards the weekend before Valentineaposs Day, where they said they had teamed up with Tesco and Hallmark to design the cards with ied sensory features.

Just when The Firm thought they had buried one of the most shameful and humiliating periods in its recent history, the Queen has been dealt another hammer blow. Scotland Yard launching a criminal probe into an alleged cash for honours scandal at the heart of one of Prince Charles’s charities is not just another extraordinary development in exceptional times. It may call into question the very fabric of those operating at the heart of the monarchy.  Once again, as she has done many times before in times of trouble, the Queen today summoned the strength to put on a brave face and put duty first. But one could not fail to be moved by her admission, walking stick in hand, that she was unable to move as she would wish while a dignitary was wheeled out for a photo-op at her Windsor home. Just as she should be preparing to revel in the glory of her remarkable  years on the throne, it seems as though events are imploding around her. The family had hoped the shame of Prince Andrew’s involvement with two convicted sex offenders would be finalised ahead of Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year. But questions will surely remain over the Queen’s judgment in helping her son make such a settlement to his sex abuse accuser, which largely remains shrouded in secrecy. All of this against a backdrop of another potential scandal, which may see her son Charles and grandson Prince Harry quizzed by police, albeit as witnesses in the first instance. If ever there was a time to unite and collectively take the strain, now is that time for the family. Whether they are too fractured to do so is a story to be continued.

The news comes after the UK has had to tolerate two years of Covid , with multiple iants like Omicron, Delta and Alpha taking it in turns to cause havoc, lock down the country and claim the lives of thousands of people. With signs emerging that Omicron is beginning to recede, the government has begun to dramatically scale back restrictions over the UK.In the biggest change yet, mandatory isolation for people who test positive for the virus is due to be lted on February . What is the new Covid iant   It has been labelled ‘Deltacron’ after seemingly exhibiting aspects of the Omicron and Delta iants that have, at dfering points, ripped through the UK. Its scientic name is BA. + B....Experts have reported it has developed in patients who caught both Omicron and Delta at the same time,WalesOnlinereports.The UK Health Security Agency, or UKHSA, is yet to deliver a verdict on how contagious this form of the virus is, or how dangerous it could be for people who catch it.According to theMail , the UKHSA is yet to announce how many cases of the hybrid have been found in the country.Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious diseases expert at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: If both Delta and Omicron are falling then, in theory, this [iant] should struggle to take off. Covid iants that are products of recombination are rare but have been known to form at points throughout the pandemic - three cases have arisen in the past with hundreds having been infected. Speaking to the MailOnline, a UKHSA source said: We monitor everything as a matter of course, but we are not particularly anxious about this iant. The developments have led to Deltacron being included in the UKHSA’s iant surveillance report.Indiareports that the iant was initially believed to be a laboratory error, however, its inclusion in the report has signalled that the iant is real.The same publication reports that the UKHSA is yet to report whether the iant was imported to the UK or whether it is native. The Mail report that sources at the UKHSA is “not concerned” by the iant with case numbers remaining low. The findings are contextualised by generally positive news about Covid, with the number of people who have tested positive up to February  having fallen by ,, or .%, in the last seven days.

It means that he has now avoided a potentially explosive trial with the settlement said to be £million.In the past two years since giving a car crash interview on BBC Newsnight about his association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Andrewaposs le has changed dramatically. Shortly after the sit-down interview, he sensationally quit public le - announcing it in a statement that was approved by the Queen.Meanwhile, just last month, the Duke of York was stripped of all his military affiliations and royal patronages by his mother the monarch. The statement from Buckingham Palace also said he would continue not to undertake any public duties. Now the civil claim against him has been settled, what could be next for Andrew  We take a look... Public roleThis year, Andrewaposs mother the Queen is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee after marking  years on the throne.In June, there will be a host of celebrations on a bumper four-day long bank holiday weekend. So will we see Andrew at these events or indeed carry out public duties in the future now a settlement has been agreed According to former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, absolutely not. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .She told the Mirror: The Queen has already assured the smooth transition of the monarchy by expressing her wish for Camilla to be Queen alongside Prince Charles. And the new King will want a streamlined modern monarchy in which Andrew was already surplus to requirements. He is, of course, a much-loved son and is adored by his ex-we, Fergie, and their two daughters. He will remain part of the royal family into which he was born, and I am sure the Queen will include him in family le. But there can be no public role for him ever again.  The fact is that Prince Andrew will forever remain tarnished by more than a decade of speculation about his friendship with a convicted paedophile.However, a report last week suggested Andrew could make a public appearance at a remembrance service for his late father Prince Philip next month.Sources told the Sun Andrew is expected at the ceremony at Westminster Abbey on March .Duke of York title stripped   While Andrew may have been stripped of his military affiliations and his royal patronages - he still retains his Duke of York title.And even though the civil claim been settled, he is facing renewed calls to give up his ducal title. Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central, says Andrew must remove his association with the city in light of the out-of-court settlement reached with Virginia Giuffre. She added that she welcomed the Duke of York’s pledge to donate money to his accuser’s charity, but said his relationship with disgraced Jeffrey Epstein had damaged the city’s reputation. She said: “Although it is a relief that Prince Andrew has finally acknowledged and expressed regret for his close association with a convicted sex offender and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, his long delay in doing so and initial response to the charges and Ms Giuffre have been source of deep hurt and embarrassment to many people across the city. “Carrying a title does create an ambassadorial relationship with that place, and for somewhere with a global reputation, such as York, this is extremely important.  “It is to be welcomed that he has now pledged to support the fight against the evils of sex trafficking and its victims. “To demonstrate his seriousness in this endeavour, and his respect for those affected by abuse and the people of our city, I would ask that his first act of contrition is to confirm his support for the withdrawal of his ducal title.” Quoting a poll from York’s daily newspaper The Press, she highlighted how  per cent of people in the city who were asked wanted Andrew’s association with it to be removed. Helping sex trafficking victims   In court documents filed yesterday indicating a settlement had been agreed, a statement was included in a letter submitted to US judge Lewis A Kaplan, who has been overseeing the civil sex claim brought by Ms Giuffre.In it, Andrew admitted his regret at his association with Jeffrey Epstein and also vowed to support sex trafficking victims. Part of the statement said: It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. “Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”  However, Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor, has said that he has spoken with many sexual attack victims and claims they have told him they would not work with Andrew.Writing in the Mirror, he said: Victims have been so badly affected by the language his legal team has been using I cannot think any of them will want to be in the same room as him. I’m patron of nine charities working with victims of sex offending. However, he added: I’m happy to offer him the opportunity to meet victims, in confidence, to understand their suffering and how victim-blaming of the type he indulged in will have affected them.

Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted.Professor Wei Shen Lim, Covid chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , said: The Committee has carefully considered the potential direct health impacts of vaccination and potential indirect educational impacts.The main purpose of offering vaccination to --year-olds is to increase their protection against severe illness in advance of a potential future wave of Covid-.Here is all you need to know...  What is the advice  The JCVI advice is for parents of --year-olds to get them vaccinated “ they feel comfortable” to protect against possible future Covid waves. They fear that should a new iant trigger a wave, at that point it will be too late to get all children in this age group protected by vaccination in time. The very small chance of severe complications in this age group is thought to be bigger than the even smaller chance of severe vaccine side effects. Some % of - year olds are thought to have already had Covid, however immunity wanes over time, particularly against mild infection.  What is dferent about this advice  While the independent experts advise that this age group should have the jab, the JCVI have issued a more nuanced message and stress it is not an emergency programme like previous vaccine drives. They say parents should not rush to get them vaccinated against Covid at the expense of school time or other childhood vaccinations such as the MMR jab. In the older  to  age group so far . million have received at least one dose.  What was considered when deciding to recommend jabs for this age group  While school absences were considered this was not a signicant factor. This was because pupils can require time off with mild side effects - such fever, headache or sore arm - as well as requiring time off due to Covid. The main factor was the risk of serious illness to the child. The JCVI weighed up the extremely low risk of severe Covid symtoms versus the extremely low risk of severe vaccine side effects.  What is my child’s risk  In a future Covid wave between  and  cases of a rare inflammatory condition called PIMS-TS triggered by Covid will be prevented for every million double vaccinated - year olds. The JCVI also estimates that between  and  Covid hospitalisations will be prevented per million double jabbed in this age group, as well as up to three ICU admissions. This was compared to the risk of the most worrying vaccine side effect of Covid- vaccines, known as myocarditis. This is inflammation of the heart muscle and it is still unclear how harmful it is in the long term. The JCVI estimates it occurs in less than two per million children given the Pfizer jab.  How will rollout work It is yet to be decided whether vaccines will be administered to - year olds in schools or NHS centres.From April this age group will be offered two  micrograms doses of the Pfizer vaccine This is much less than the  microgram doses given to adults.

Victoria’s Secret has launched a string of initiatives over the past few years to try and regain credibility in the face of declining sales and past accusations of a culture of misogyny at the business.Recent moves by the company include its first mastectomy bra, racially erse models promoting underwear in dferent skin tones, and hiring transgender beauty Valentina Sampaio after being criticised for its lack of ersity.

Sofia also founded her own brand, Alavett, launching its online store in . She came to global attention when she made her catwalk debut at New York Fashion Week in February . She said she hoped her success would inspire other people with Down’s. Speaking at the time she said: “I am proud as one of the few models with Downaposs syndrome who have managed to participate in the important fashion event. “Modelling in the United States was the beginning of conquering the dream I have had since an early age - to model on the most important runways in the world.”  Victoria’s Secret launched their Love Cloud collection on Monday designed to be comfortable everyday underwear as part of their ongoing efforts to rebrand. The campaign sees  women modelling the range, some are professional models while others are inspiring women, to reinforce the message that the brand is for everyone. The inclusive campaign features Celilo Miles, a Nez Perce Tribe-Wildland firefighter and Sylvia Buckler, an accessory designer who models the bra while cradling her pregnant belly. Speaking to Vogue, Celilo said she still cannot believe she was selected for the campaign. aposI used to watch the Victoriaaposs Secret fashion show and wish that I could be up on that stage. aposEveryone wanted to be in that club, but you knew you didn’t belong there, she said. She added that when she started modelling she tried to lose weight in order to fit a size she could not sustain because she believed it was the done thing. The campaign also features plus-sized models like Paloma Elsesser, and Devyn Garcia.Voguehas noted the collection is the first under the tenure of Victoriaaposs Secretaposs new creative director Raúl Martinez, who has been working hard at rethinking how the brand markets itself to women.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON New York Fashion WeekLingerieDowns syndrome\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Thinking he was just enjoying the lights, his mum Madhu Kumar didnapost think too much of it - but he was actually surfing the net and splashing the cash. The family from New Jersey, US, got a knock at the door days later and piles and piles of huge boxes were sitting there ready for them. After looking at her online banking, she discovered almost , was missing.  The decor-loving lad, who is nearly two, had placed orders for chairs, flower stands and additional household items. A number of them were so large that they could barely fit through the front door.Ayaansh, who decided to order a number of items more than once, will have trouble repeating the trick in the near future. The family plan to keep a couple of the items as a memento of their totaposs adventure and have ed the rest to a nearby Walmart supermarket.  Thankfully, they have been told they will receive a refund. But Madhu told NBC New York she is taking measures to make sure no more online shopping can take place. He’s so little, he’s so cute, we were laughing that he ordered all this stuff, she said. It is really hard to believe that he has done this, but that’s what happened.  I need one or two items, why would we need four of the same thing  The mum has said that she will be placing much tighter controls on all her devices to prevent any more of Ayaanshaposs shopping sprees. She added: Moving forward, we will put tough passcodes or face recognition so when he picks up the phone he finds it in locked condition.

Eight years after the flight vanished, a new report claims to have found the “exact location” of the Malaysian Airlines jet.It vanished in March , along with the  passengers and crew onboard, with no one able to confirm what happened to it. The plane departed Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing on March , but lost contact with air traffic control after  minutes. However now, new technology could solve the nearly decade old mystery. Australian air safety investigators have renewed their search after a report from Richard Godfrey, a British aerospace engineer.  He has claimed that the plane went down km west of Perth and currently sits at the bottom of the ocean under ,m of water. Angus Mitchell of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has renewed focus on what he calls “the largest unsolved mystery of our time”. Mr Mitchell stressed he did not want give the victims’ families  hope, but said that Mr Godfrey’s research was “credible” but stopped short of saying it would be enough to find the aircraft.In an upcoming Sky News Australia documentary, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has confirmed it and Geoscience Australia have been looking over Godfreyaposs data. While the bureauaposs involvement in the search officially concluded five years ago, their new chief commissioner Mitchell has renewed focus on the missing plane. Godfrey, a Germany-based Brit, first became interested in doomed flights after the Air France Flight  vanished on its way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, in May .  He had been due to fly on it, but was asked to remain in South America on business, which delayed his departure by two weeks, saving his le. The flight disappeared with  people on board and it was only found in the Atlantic two years later. He said: When I saw that Air France  had crashed in the middle of the Atlantic I got involved in reading up on that story and followed the underwater search for the wreckage.

He said he has been able to track the planeaposs final movements using a system called Weak Signal Propagation, or, in his words a bunch of tripwires that work in every direction over the horizon to the other side of the globe, which are triggered when planes disrupt the signal when they fly through.

This has been a complete shock for our community, said Dylan Parker, the mayor of Randwick Council which includes Little Bay. Our coastline is our back yard and to have a tragic death under such horrying circumstances is completely shocking. Local fishermen and beachgoers watched on helplessly as the predator mauled the victim to death. One witness told how they witnessed the shark swallow parts of his body after ripping what they believe to be a man in two. In the footage, those who heard the heartbreaking screams can be seen reacting to the devastating attack.  The attack comes days before the Murray Rose Malabar Magic Ocean Swim, an annual charity event usually attended by thousands of swimmers at a neighbouring beach. Organisers said they were monitoring the situation andthe event had to be postponed it would be held on March . A spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries said its shark biologists believe that a white shark at least  metresinwas likely responsible for the attack. It was the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since , data showed. Authorities have ordered people to remain out of the water on a hot summer day as temperatures hovered around C. A few crazy surfers still go out and take the risk but most of us take notice and just stay out of the water until the sharks have gone. Itaposs a lot more dangerous driving to be quite honest, said local resident Karen Romalis.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

Before joining farming, I had no idea the community was so heavily impacted by bad mental health.#If one person reads about Mind Your Head and decides to reach out or to check in on a loved one, that’s a step in the right direction.#Please, be that person and start the conversation.

than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low

What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for

charging solutions” for people without a driveway or safe place to charge at home.Additional sensors will be installed nearby at Esk- side East, where the council will deploy further bollard-style ‘on-street’ chargers following successful trials last year.These chargers will continue to have no parking restrictions next to them, as the council says it recognises parking is at a premium in many residential areas.To address the fear these kinds of charger are frequently blocked, the Fuuse App will display the availability of parking spaces and not just the status of the chargers themselves.EV drivers who remain in charging spaces beyond a permitted duration – or after their session is complete – can also receive notications to vacate the space, allowing others to access the charger and avoiding fines.Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Council transport spokesperson, said: “For those who don’t have a safe place to park and charge at home, seeing live, on-street status in their area will address potential concerns over finding an attractive space close to their home.“We know this can deter people from switching to EVs.“For those that choose to use our many destination or

It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as energy efficient as possible while supporting landlords, tenants and homeowners to do the same by signposting to appropriate advice and support from partner agencies.“The new East Lothian Poverty Partnership set up by East Lothian Council is due to hold its first meeting next month, bringing together public sector agencies, voluntary organisations and community groups to combine efforts to tackle poverty.”"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10655356.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"wordle-242-todays-wordle-february-16-hints","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.: Wordle  What is today’s Wordle  February  hintsThe game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way. Today’s word starts with the letter C and ends with the letter K.There are  vowels in today’s word.It is a waterproof filler and sealant. If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

The recipe is for Dracula Salad and was her memorial to her late husband, Cruden Bay and his famous book.Also seen as an important Scottish link to the novel Dracula is the influence of Scottish writer Emily Gerard on Bram Stoker’s placing the plot in Transylvania.The Jedburgh-born author wrote a book about Transylvanian superstitions, which played a crucial role in Bram Stokers research when writing his classic novel.Scotlands capital also plays a part as the publishing house of Dracula was founded by Edinburgh bookseller and stationer Archibald Constable.Occultist and author JW Brodie-Innes, a leading member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawns Amen-Ra Temple in Edinburgh has been a personal friend.In his supernatural horror novel The Devils Mistress - first published in , three years after Bram Stoker died - he paid tribute to the Dracula author in a special dedication in his book.It says: \"To the memory of my dear friend, the author of Dracula, to whose help and encouragement I owe more than I am at present at liberty to state\".Dacre Stoker says he is now investigating what that \"more\" actually was.Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a spirtualist, also features in Bram Stoker story as a friend. He was at the Edinburgh authors marriage on  September .When Bram Stoker managed The Lyceum Theatre in London, he produced the Conan Doyle play A Story of Waterloo.In one letter Conan Doyle said that he had enjoyed reading Dracula adding: \"I think it is the very best story of Diablerie which I have read in many years.\"Dacre Stoker said: \"Both of these guys obviously were interested in the occult and Conan Doyle recognised that.\"Bram Stokers career as a theatre manager, also saw him heavily involved in the opening night of the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in .The Glasgow connection comes as Bram Stoker got the job to support the staging of plays at the Theatre Royal.There is a theory that name of RM Renfield, the fictional character that is unquestionably loyal to the vampire in the Dracula novel, was taken from Glasgows Renfield Street.A Visit Scotland source said of the trail: \"It will be something we will work with Dacre on, to look at related sites for a potential trail and how accessible they are for visitors, for instance,they are open to the public, and what the visitor experience would beadded to a self guided trail.\"An Experience Transylvania spokeswoman added: \"The intentions of the Scottish trail are to follow all existing and relevant Dracula connections in the region, including of course Cruden Bay.\"The trail could also take in the Aberdeenshire former fishing village of Collieston, where a shipwreck of a th Century Spanish galleon is said to have provided the inspiration for Bram Stokers second novel, The Mystery of the Sea.Further around the coast at Whinnyfold, Bram Stoker wrote his book, Lair of the White Worm.The Aberdeenshire village of Gardenstown is where the author stayed in  and could have finished writing Dracula which was published a year later.Dacre Stoker said: “Scotland is where many chapters of the novel Dracula were actually written. It was during his long walks along the beach of Cruden Bay and on to Whinnyfold where all of Bram’s earlier inspiration, notes and research came together. This area offered him peace and quiet, a far cry from the interruptions and the stresses of his office in the Lyceum Theatre in London.\"Many ask how come we don’t celebrate in Transylvania, Whitby or Dublin. All these other locations do play a role in the origins of Dracula, of course, but when it comes to celebrating the literary process - the process of a writer bringing the story to le - I think Scotland, is a given”.Jenni Steele, film and creative industries manager for VisitScotland said of the th anniversary event: “This is a fantastic opportunity for people to learn about the Scottish connections to this well-loved novel. Dracula holds such a sense of intrigue and mystery, and it’s easy to see why Bram Stoker was inspired by some of Scotland’s magical landscapes and locations on his travels – not to mention the fascinating connections he had with many other Scottish writers and personalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-let-andrew-keep-titles----shows-nobility-no-better-rest","story":"This would facilitate perpetuation of the illusion that members of the titled classes are morally and socially superior to the rest of us.No thank you.Let him keep his titles and do not disguise or obscure the undeniable truth, well supported by history, that disreputable characters are no less likely to be found among nobility and royalty than among the untitled masses which I am proud to belong to.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.ROYALS CAN NOW REBUILDPRINCE Andrew has finally thrown in the towel and settled out of court, which rescues his mothers celebrations in her Platinum Jubilee from all the unsavoury revelations which could well have emerged from the court proceedings he claimed to be ready to face. Perhaps he could now devote himself to doing unsung charity work behind the scenes to atone for his errors of judgment while the task of restoring the somewhat tarnished reputation of the monarchy is left to Charles and Camilla along with William and Kate.No doubt after all this adverse publicity the royal family needs a boost to cement its standing in the eyes of the nation and to maintain its position of providing our head of state in keeping with the honourable tradition which brings pageantry and colour with its benefits to our nations tourist income.If the Queen now chose to abdicate at the conclusion of her Platinum Jubilee year, the door would be open to a fresh wave of what would assuredly be positive and good publicity to wash away the stain which has been haunting the institution of the monarchy for some years now.And Her Majesty, who has faithfully observed her duty to the country, could enjoy her well-deserved retirement, knowing that no one will ever be able to match her record as the longest-ever serving monarch.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.* I AM pleased Prince Andrews lawyers have agreed a pay-off over the civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre.

That is what teams with deep pockets did in the past. It will provide us with a more competitive field for the future.”Hamilton’s gripping title tussle with Verstappen contributed to one of the sport’s greatest seasons and there is a possibility that F’s rulebook rewrite could thwart a second chapter.But Brawn added: “Last year was a great season between two drivers and two teams.

Four players left in January. Four important players for Tottenham, two have arrived. So even numerically instead of reinforcing yourself you may have, on paper, weakened.”Conte has been backed with ready-made signings at Juventus, Cha and Inter Milan but believes that will not be the case at Spurs.He added: “It is inevitable that in January it is very dficult to get two players like Bentancur and Kulusevski to sign who, I repeat, are the ideal prospects for Tottenham. Because Tottenham is looking for young players, players to be developed, not ready players. That is the issue.“The vision, the philosophy of the club is this. It is inevitable thatyou want to grow faster andyou want to be competitive more quickly you need players with a lot of experience because they also lead to an increase in experience in your team.“But then again, the vision of the club I realised is this and will continue to be this.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645020787354.jpg--covid_19___wed_16th_february_figures.jpg?1645020787000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220216newscovid 19 wed 16th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

The injections will be -microgram doses of Pfizer-BioNTech#s vaccine - a third of the strength of an adult dose.Some children in this age group began receiving Covid vaccines in December but until now, jabs were only available to children with health conditions that put them at increased risk or those who live with an immunosuppressed patient.When askedshe would give the vaccine to her own childthey were in that age group, Ms Yiasouma said: I genuinely don#t know. I have read what JCVI published. I genuinely don#t know what I would domy children were that age. I would think very carefully. If my children were in the older age group, I would talk with them. I would also maybe have a talk with my GP and with other parents, she said.I was in support of the older children being vaccinated. The JCVI advice is not one way or the other. Parents should be allowed make the decision that#s right - they shouldn#t be pilloried, they shouldn#t be attacked.Parents are ided into those who consider the minimal risk to their children of getting ill, while others want their child not to be at risk of getting Covid. I don#t envy parents making this decision, she said.In order to support them, Ms Yiasouma said very clear and accessible advice should be made available by the Public Health Agency with the Department of Health to allow parents to come to a decision.There is a compelling argument around future waves -[they] are more serious than Omicron has been, JCVI has said this will protect children and families and communities from future waves.JCVI deputy chair Professor Anthony Harnden said he accepted the advice could be clearer. With the well - year olds, the decision is much more finely balanced. Although serious complications from Covid are very rare with well children, the rare side effects from the side effects are even rarer. So actually there is a marginal health benefit to vaccinating children now, he said.We don#t know what#s going to happen in the future. There may be a future wave in the summer of Covid and there may be another iant. We wanted to give parents the choice of this one-off offer of a Covid vaccine. If that comes across as ambiguous, we apologise. Sometimes le is not black and white.If you#ve been vaccinated and infected, then you get a much broader immune profile [after vaccination] that protects against future iants.In response to comments that the vaccine for younger children wasn#t rolled out quickly enough, Prof Harnden said the JCVI issued guidance on December  that children with underlying illnesses should be vaccinated. The paediatric vaccine hadn#t been approved by the [UK regulator] MHRNA at that point and wasn#t rolled out by the NHS until that time, he said. We have had time to make that decision. Other countries have pushed ahead with they pushed ahead for dferent reasons.The full guidance from JCVI said fewer than two children would develop inflamed heart muscleout of every million vaccinated.Prof Harnden said: We#ve been very careful about trying to characterise that, that#s between one and two per million, they#re very mild and we#re using a dferent vaccine schedule in this country with a twelve week gap between the first and second dose so we#re hoping we#ll eliminate [that] risk - it won#t be nil but it will be very small indeed.He added: It#s not a trial vaccine, there have been a lot of paediatric trials and it#s been used in other countries.On Wednesday, Health Minister Robin Swann said: As has always been the case, our vaccination programme will continue to be guided by the expert advice.This announcement by the JCVI underlines the important role that the Covid- vaccines plays in protecting people of all ages and has only been taken after rigorous assessment of both safety and effectiveness.Health trusts would work with the Public Health Agency to put the advice into operation and further details of the roll-out would be released shortly, he added.Most ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are lted \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastLatest CoronavirusVaccine jabs for kids aged - ‘will add extra line of defence’Children aged  to  in Northern Ireland to be offered Covid- jabMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid passport scheme was #proportionate and justiable#, judge rulesWatch: Belfast shoppers split over masks as rules replaced with guidanceLatestRights group documents ‘suppression of fundamental liberties’ in VietnamPlan for social housing beside Belfast’s St George’s Market refused after swathe of objectionsFrance to withdraw troops from Mali but remain in West AfricaWhat time and TV channel is Borussia Dortmund v Rangers and will Erling Haaland be fit  Kick-off time, team news and match odds ahead of Europa League play-off clashPlane crashes into lorry on North Carolina highway,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionBusinessSportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen the books are written and history students look back on the early s, they’ll be forgiven for thinking they’re studying science fiction instead.Had a man with a sandwich board been shouting “the end is nigh” outside Belfast City Hall in February , it would have looked like he had a point. It was the end of the world as we knew it.Read MoreNiamh Campbell:OpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidance“The end is nigh” means something dferent today, and we can all breathe a little easier.There is no doubt that without the restrictions we would be looking back on a lot more lives lost to Covid than the official figure of over ,.For many, their last moments were spent alone. For those who mourned, they watched from afar. That was one of the hardest restrictions to bear.Pulling our bedroom curtains closed on Monday, March , , we did so wondering what sort of world would await when we opened them the next morning.The UK death toll stood at , three of them here.St Patrick’s Day had already been cancelled, giving the first hint of what was heading our direction. Then lockdown started.Farewells were said to those in nursing homes as the doors closed to visits. Businesses shut, save for those deemed essential.The queues outside supermarkets started. Our children spent their first day at home after the closure of schools.That was  days ago.We had all suspected it was coming, having watched images from around the world as the pandemic wave approached our shores.Shielding letters were sent to , of the most vulnerable, telling how they were to go into isolation.March ,  was furlough day as the Government committed to support % of wages for employees.Three days later gatherings of more than two people were banned. It was essential trips only.Thursday, March  saw the start of a weekly ritual as we clapped for carers. Communities made scrubs and masks for front line workers. On a bigger scale, companies were redeploying staff and taking on new workers to help the cause as fears over a lack of PPE rose.Then, at pm on Saturday, March  lockdown officially commenced.We said farewell to work colleagues, socially distanced ourselves from family and friends, and started to embrace a new style of community.Those of us with children became teachers overnight. Our children taught us a thing or two also, with crash courses on Zoom, Facetime and TikTok.The older generation had to embrace the technology the young had grown up with. Hands upyou logged in to a Zoom meeting hiding those pyjama bottoms under the kitchen table Maybe it was just as well for our egos the pubs and nightclubs were closed. Self-styled hair, out of necessity, was perhaps not the way to go.Strange as it may seem, being apart from other people actually brought us closer together.For the older among us, we instantly felt a need to hug our parents as soon as we were told we couldn’t. It would be a shame not to remember that. In a way, we all became heroes of a sort. “Stay at home, save lives,” was the message. We stayed at home, while others manned the front line.Driving around was an eerie experience in those early days — few cars on the road shops shut.And when we went out for a walk to get some exercise we actually heard the birdsong.Weddings were halted. Birthdays went uncelebrated. Holidays put on hold.And in the midst of all the sitting around doing not very much at all, a new vocabulary sprung up: furlough the R-rate PPE self-isolation shielding.Social distancing was no longer the domain of the school disco, where the boys sat on one side and the girls on the other.We all wanted to knowwe were a key worker. There was the unprecedented rolling out of guidelines, restrictions, support services and grants to keep businesses afloat.Confusion reigned: how many could meet in a garden  Where could airplanes take us to, and what did we need to get there  What was a ‘wet’ pub Little by little, the restrictions we were living with eased and chinks of light started to emerge.Cemeteries reopened on April  after a public outcry — the first easing of curbs.Monday, May  saw garden centres reopen, with the promise of more rules being ltedthe downward trend in cases of Covid continued.All eyes were on the R-rate, but the same day saw the first signs of a lockdown breakdown.By the end of the month, with temperatures soaring, thousands headed for the seaside.Still, on May , for the first time since March , no deaths were recorded. Positive signs were emerging, and further lockdown easements saw le edging back, evenit was baby steps.But there were relapses. We were teased with the freedom of the pre-pandemic world, only to have it pulled back from us as new iants, second waves of the virus, kept arriving.Restrictions came, then were eased. But they never went away.For many, particularly in the business world, there has been a heavy price to pay.Some pub doors were shut, never to open again. Even big names such as Debenhams could not survive the pandemic, having battled for years against the growth in online retailing.Then there was the impact on people’s wellbeing.That many died having contracted Covid has been well documented, but lockdown brought with it the extra baggage of isolation. The mental state of people was a constant concern.Sure, it’ll be over by Christmas, we said in . We said the same in .It wouldn’t be this placethe ending of restrictions didn’t bring with it some added confusion and doubt.With the Executive unable to meet due to the lack of a First and Deputy First Minister, the issue became a legal matter.In years to come there’ll be plenty of stories told starting with the words: “Do you remember the time ”Those history books  years from now will be filled with the facts and the figures, the bumps in the road, the scandals of those in public office.But we’ve lived with it all, lived through it all, and come out the other side.We can all see a little more clearly now.The dark clouds have been replaced by that hopeful rainbow we’ve been teased with several times over the past two years.There does come a time when we have to learn to live in the world as it is, as close as we can to the way we did.We might not be quite stepping into the brightest of bright days.Restrictions will change to guidelines and recommendations.There will still be many content to take the precautions they feel they need, and everyone should move forward at their own pace.Hopefully the last two years have taught the majority of us to appreciate the things in our lives that are most important to us — our family and friends.Le moves fast. Hopefully, before long, the darkest days of Covid will be a memory.Being honest, a lot of people had left those memories behind some time ago.But think, too, of those who bring the memory of loved ones lost into a world their parent, husband, we, sister or brother is not there to enjoy beside them.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City Council PremiumBigger rates bills on way for all NI householdsNI cinema owner calls on Belfast council to change The Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsCall for Belfast City Council to remember Bloody Friday  years onCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young people PremiumBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsMost ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest CoronavirusVaccine jabs for kids aged - ‘will add extra line of defence’Children aged  to  in Northern Ireland to be offered Covid- jabMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid passport scheme was #proportionate and justiable#, judge rulesWatch: Belfast shoppers split over masks as rules replaced with guidanceLatestGoogle reveals plans to bring Privacy Sandbox to AndroidRights group documents ‘suppression of fundamental liberties’ in VietnamPlan for social housing beside Belfast’s St George’s Market refused after swathe of objectionsFrance to withdraw troops from Mali but remain in West AfricaWhat time and TV channel is Borussia Dortmund v Rangers and will Erling Haaland be fit  Kick-off time, team news and match odds ahead of Europa League play-off clash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBronagh Murray with her lawyer Brian ArcherAllan PrestonTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Co Down woman who won a religious and sexual discrimination case against the Ministry of Defencehas told of how months of insults by an Army captain left her dreading the thought of going to work.Bronagh Murray , a Catholic civilian worker who was stationed in Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn, is set to receive over £, in compensation after the decision of a Fair Employment Tribunal in Belfast this week. It is believed to be one of the largest awards of its kind, with the MoD also accepting liability.Read MoreCatholic woman who left job over alleged harassment by her Army boss to receive more than £, compensationSpeaking to the Belfast , Ms Murray said she was relieved at the decision and was now focused on rebuilding her le.I absolutely dreaded going to work even though I had an immaculate record as a civil servant since I was , she said.“At times I just couldn’t think straight. I thought I had a handle on it by ignoring him but I obviously didn’t. I kept thinking, ‘he’s getting the message, it just needs to stop’. I didn’t approach him at the time about the harassment because I felt I wouldn’t be believed and it would lead to more harassment because I didn’t find him funny.The harassment by the Army captain, who cannot be named for security reasons, took place over a five-month period in , with Ms Murray later retiring due to deteriorating psychiatric condition in .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The tribunal heard that the captain repeatedly referenced her religion in front of others and had also referred to her as “the big cougar”.In one incident, he was reported to have said: “I need back up, I have an Irish Catholic girl armed and dangerous, come quick, need help.”During an office conversation about a concert, it’s also claimed that he said: “I bet you have tried to steal a cone, that is the Catholic coming out in you.”After starting the complaint process in September , the captain was eventually disciplined and transferred to another military posting.The tribunal awarded Ms Murray around £, to cover injury to feelings, psychiatric injuries, loss of previous earnings and interest. Not due to retire until , compensation for loss of future earnings was calculated in excess of £,.She added: “I’m just so relieved and pleased with the outcome. I feel great because I’m totally vindicated and at long last the truth has come out.”She said the admission of liability from the MoD was particularly important.I didn’t ask for any of this, I had every intention of working until retirement age. Because of what happened to me, my health broke down and I was left with no other option than to go through the process of ill health retirement.“It was just so stressful, it was a horrible feeling. I had confided in a few close friends who knew what I was going through. It was such a hard time.”She said finding the courage to eventually speak up had felt like a major risk at the time.“I was afraid I wouldn’t be taken seriously, especially the cougar comment, she said.“I know a lot of people, even women, can find that funny, but I don’t. He just came out with it, he had been talking about someone looking for me ‘because you’re a big cougar’. I nearly fell off the chair. I just don’t find that funny or acceptable. It was a horrible feeling, the worst thing to say to a woman.“On every occasion that he did say something, I was at my desk typing or doing my admin work. I didn’t ask for this, he came to me to insult me.”Askedshe felt the insults were down to vindictiveness or just immaturity, she replied: “I really don’t know what he was thinking. It just beggars belief what was going through his head. All I wanted was to do my job and head home, but I was absolutely dreading it.Ms Murray also thanked her legal team, solicitor Brian Archer and barrister Michael Potter, for their “total support” throughout the entire process.Most ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are lted \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandThousands of homes without power after Storm Dudley hits UKMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleyIrish League clubs to join forces at Windsor Park meeting in bid to force Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to release £m Stadia FundingDavid Jeffrey: Irish League helped Northern Ireland through dark days of the Troubles and Covid… give us our £.m stadia fundingSpringing back: Festival hosts more than  eventsLatestFrance to withdraw troops from Mali but remain in West AfricaWhat time and TV channel is Borussia Dortmund v Rangers and will Erling Haaland be fit  Kick-off time, team news and match odds ahead of Europa League play-off clashPlane crashes into lorry on North Carolina highwayKit Harington ‘grateful’ he got sober before having a childThousands of homes without power after Storm Dudley hits UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There was concern the new residential units would not be fit for families.”She added other issues included lack of amenity space, overshadowing, particularly to the lower apartments, and fire safety concerns.Mr Gormley told the committee: “I don’t believe the proposal in front of members today is the right one. It risks undermining the very engagement to which the council has committed itself.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up I believe it should be rejected, leaving the door open for the developer and the community to come together to discuss and resolve the acknowledged flaws in this application.”David Worthington, a representative from the Markets Development Association, told the committee the proposal involves “wholly substandard areas of open space,” and apartments that would “experience constant overshadowing and inadequate light levels.”He said: “It has been said the proposal doesn’t really need any more private open space because it is close to the Waterfront, City Hall and other open spaces in the city centre. Those are all public open spaces – private open space is essential in all residential developments, and the minimum requirement is  square metres per apartment.”He added: “The message is you are being asked to set aside the regular rules, because this is social housing, and so it should be approved that those rules shouldn’t apply to it. The trouble with this is, you are essentially being told that social housing is second class housing.”Sinn Fein councillor Matt Garrett proposed the committee reject the plan, and this was unanimously agreed by elected members.Most ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are lted \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandThousands of homes without power after Storm Dudley hits UKMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleyIrish League clubs to join forces at Windsor Park meeting in bid to force Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to release £m Stadia FundingDavid Jeffrey: Irish League helped Northern Ireland through dark days of the Troubles and Covid… give us our £.m stadia fundingSpringing back: Festival hosts more than  eventsLatestFrance to withdraw troops from Mali but remain in West AfricaWhat time and TV channel is Borussia Dortmund v Rangers and will Erling Haaland be fit  Kick-off time, team news and match odds ahead of Europa League play-off clashPlane crashes into lorry on North Carolina highwayKit Harington ‘grateful’ he got sober before having a childThousands of homes without power after Storm Dudley hits UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Patrick’s sister Charley was their surrogate and they used a donor egg.It was a long and expensive process for the family, with heartache along the way after a first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. There were also delays caused by the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatrick and Jon Coyle with baby Wren, who was conceived using a donor egg and carried by Patrick’s sister Charley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatrick and Jon Coyle with baby Wren, who was conceived using a donor egg and carried by Patrick’s sister CharleyShortly before Wren was tucked into bed at the family home, Patrick and Jon told this newspaper about the emotional moment Charley offered to carry their baby five years ago.Patrick, who had assumed that fostering or adoption was their only choice, said: “We didn’t really think this would ever be an option for us. “We’d heard of people going to America for surrogacy but had heard it could cost , . That was something we could only dream of. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “When we were talking about it, people would say, ‘I would love to do that for you, but...’.”A few weeks after Charley had mentioned in passing that she would help, she sat the couple down to say she was serious.Jon recalled: “From that point, it felt like a possibility. She told us her thoughts on it, how her family and her partner felt about it and how it would be for her children.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBaby Wren FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBaby WrenThe couple had considered using an egg donor clinic in Kiev but were encouraged to advertise in a local newspaper.They were stunned when they received a reply after a week, with the donor stipulating the egg should go to a gay couple. They subsequently attended a clinic in Belfast, with all family members having to go through counselling.Patrick said: “It was actually a really good gateway to open up questions that you might not have wanted to ask.“Charley [was] telling her children what way we would do things when she had the baby. “[We were asking], ‘Whatthere’s something wrong the baby  Who would decide what happens ”Jon said the couple were also prepared for facing intrusive questions about who the father of the baby was.“Who would ask that  But I’m sure plenty of people will be thinking it without saying it, so how do you manage people’s expectations ” he asked.Patrick added: “But the way the counsellor put it, why would we tell anyone who Wren’s ‘real’ daddy was before she knew “But it doesn’t matter. We’re both her daddy regardless of what has happened. “There’s loads of dferent ways to make a family.

And a lot of people did ask, ‘Whose sperm did you use ’”Jon added: “It’s a natural reaction, but we can tell people the boundaries about that. I have to say it was nieces and nephews that were the easiest to tell because they just accepted it.”Patrick said that Charley’s then three-year-old daughter was quick to correct anyone who congratulated her mum for becoming pregnant.He explained: “She would turn and say to them, ‘She’s not pregnant. That’s Jon and Patrick’s baby’. Charley would be killing herself laughing.”After the “heart wrenching” pain of losing the first pregnancy, Patrick faced dark timesHe recalled: “I was in turmoil some of the times, but when you look back, it was all just washed away when Wren was here.”When the couple announced the new pregnancy, their families were delighted. Jon said: “I had never seen our parents and siblings cry with that kind of joy — they couldn’t believe it.”The day of Wren’s birth was a “surreal” experience filled with hope but also concern.But they had little reason to worry because after Wren was born just before am, the new family was at home together by dinner time.Jon said: “On that drive home and going into the house, you’re thinking, ‘Right we’re supposed to know how to look after this baby’.“It was a lot to take in, but it was amazing at the same time to know that she was ours.”Jon and Patrick are sharing their parenting story on their Instagram page @dadsjourneyMost ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy store \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest Northern IrelandPlan for social housing beside Belfast’s St George’s Market refused after swathe of objectionsNI cinema owner calls on Belfast council to change The Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsThousands of homes without power after Storm Dudley hits UKMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleyIrish League clubs to join forces at Windsor Park meeting in bid to force Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to release £m Stadia FundingLatestVisa and Amazon announce worldwide payment agreementStandard Chartered unveils share buybacks but cautions over turnaround delayIt’s still Bangkok: Thailand ends confusion over capital’s name changeGoogle reveals plans to bring Privacy Sandbox to AndroidRights group documents ‘suppression of fundamental liberties’ in Vietnam,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailColum Eastwood has accused Sinn Fein of focusing on selfish party interests rather than improving the lives of ordinary people.The SDLP leader said his rival’s -year record in government was abysmal, and while the party had engaged in radical rhetoric, it had failed to deliver.Speaking ahead of his party’s annual conference this weekend, Mr Eastwood said that despite lacklustre poll ratings, the SDLP hoped to secure two ministries in the next Executive.However, he refused rule out going into oppositionhe didn’t believe that it would be “a government truly working for the people”.In a wide-ranging interview, he described Doug Beattie as “a breath of fresh air within unionism”. While he was aghast at the UUP leader’s tweets, he respected how he had faced up to his mistakes, taken the heat and opened himself up to scrutiny in media interviews.Mr Eastwood also said he had no regrets about using parliamentary privilege to name Soldier F, who faced murder charges for his actions on Bloody Sunday.He said he was “giving a voice” to the people of Derry in a House of Commons that desperately needs to hear views from Northern Ireland other than the DUP’s.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Despite at times sharing similar policies with Sinn Fein, Mr Eastwood insisted the parties were in practice very dferent.“Sinn Fein are interested in themselves alone. They’re focused on what benefits them as a party, what improves their position, securing community jobs for their mates,” he said.“They’ve been at the top in Stormont since  and have failed to change the lives of working-class communities despite having their hands on the levers of power.“After  years, you’ve had your chance. Those who don’t deliver should be punished at the ballot box. “Sinn Fein are not outsiders. With the DUP, they are the political establishment in the North.”Mr Eastwood was unimpressed with Sinn Fein’s performance in the current Executive: “They talk a lot, but don’t seem to do much. What have they actually achieved “Nichola Mallon and Robin Swann have been the outstanding ministers in the Executive. I don’t see too many others that have done much.”The SDLP leader accused the DUP of pursuing a “destructive and unbelievably foolish course of action”y.He expects his party to improve on its  seats and % vote in the  Assembly election. He is hoping it will secure a similar vote to its  Westminster result of %.“We would hope to gain enough seats to have two ministers in the next executive,” Mr Eastwood said.“We are running to be in government. It’s in our DNA to be in government.”But he said he could not rule out going into opposition “ we think it’s a government that will do nothing for the people”.On just % in this week’s Irish News Institute of Irish Studies of University of Liverpool poll, the SDLP seems to have a steep hill to climbit is tomore MLAs. Successive LucidTalk polls for the Belfasthave put the party in fourth or fth position.“I think that too much attention is given to polls in Northern Ireland,” Mr Eastwood said“As a deeply ided society, it’s one of the hardest places to poll. You have five political parties within  to % of each other, so it’s complicated.“We are not blind to polls, but neither are we worried about them. We do our own research and we’re confident that we’re not on %.”Mr Eastwood said the DUP’s decision to collapse the Executive had polarised the political environment in a way that suited Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s party and Sinn Fein.But the SDLP leader predicted it would not be a “pro- or anti-protocol” election.“In my office in Derry, people aren’t talking about the protocol. They’re worried about bills and hospital waiting lists. They’re annoyed at sluggish government.“There has been no response to the cost of living crisis by Stormont. In Scotland, the government is putting money into people’s bank accounts. Ours is doing nothing.”The SDLP leader said that in some constituencies, his party would be battling with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s for the last seat, “and that will create a dynamic which helps us”.He cited Strangford as its best chance of a gain, followed by Fermanagh and South Tyrone and West Belfast, “while there’s an outside chance we will be in the mix at the end in South Antrim”.The SDLP faces a tough battle to retain its seats in three constituencies. However, Mr Eastwood was “very confident” Pat Catney would be re-elected in Lagan Valley he said Dolores Kelly should “never be written off” in Upper Bann and he believed his party had “enough votes to keep our two seats in South Down”.The SDLP leader said he wouldn’t be advising voters who to transfer to. “There’ll be dferent considerations in dferent constituencies,” he said. He would like people “to vote progressively and for change”.AskedSDLP supporters should transfer to unionist candidates he said: “If a candidate is progressive, then there shouldn’t be community barriers to giving them a preference. In the polling booth, I have and will transfer across the community ide.”In the wake of Doug Beattie’s tweet scandal, Mr Eastwood said he had “failed the leadership test”.Askedthe UUP leader should have resigned, he replied: “What Doug did was wrong and dficult to understand, but there was something very powerful in his ability to face up to his mistakes and to take the heat.“I think in those circumstances, people are ready to forgive. I certainly don’t agree with Doug on everything, but I like him. I think he’s coming at things from a good place. He’s a breath of fresh air for unionism.”Mr Eastwood said it had been “very important” for him to name Soldier F in the Commons.“The Bloody Sunday families wanted him outed and I wanted my constituents’ voices heard,” he explained.“I received numerous death threats for it, some more sinister than others. That’s fine for me, but it was hard for my family.“I didn’t believe anything would happen to them, but you still worry when you’re away from home at nights.”Mr Eastwood insisted that his party had influence at Westminster: “Claire Hanna and I are not going to overturn an -seat majority, but it’s vital that we — along with Stephen Farry — are there and it’s not just the DUP being heard.”He said that would particularly be the casean Executive could not be formed after May’s election and direct rule was reintroduced.The potential partnership with Fianna Fail, which Mr Eastwood had championed, is clearly now dead in the water for the SDLP.  Asked about the possibility, he would say only that he was “in regular contact” with Fianna Fail and that the shared island unit had “come out of our conversations” with Micheal Martin.Claire Hanna had strongly opposed any merger. Effectively acknowledging it was totally off the agenda now, Mr Eastwood stressed: “The SDLP stands on its own two feet.“We’ve moved beyond old arguments. I work very well with Claire Hanna at Westminster and she’s part of the leadership team.”The SDLP leader also categorically ruled out ever personally seeking a dual mandate. He dismissed rumours that he had been planning on running for Stormont as “absolute nonsense”.Related topicsSDLPSinn FéinThe Executive OfficeUlster Unionist PartyBloody SundayNichola MallonLucidTalk pollSir Jeffrey DonaldsonClaire HannaStephen FarryMost ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatestIt’s still Bangkok: Thailand ends confusion over capital’s name changeGoogle reveals plans to bring Privacy Sandbox to AndroidRights group documents ‘suppression of fundamental liberties’ in VietnamPlan for social housing beside Belfast’s St George’s Market refused after swathe of objectionsMan killed in Sydney shark attack ‘was British expat’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God.

I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up.

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it. He added: ldquoIrsquom pleased with the second half performance but certainly not with the first.Looking forward to his sidersquos next match, where they face a tough battle away to Meath, the Down boss said: ldquoWersquoll try to get more men back on the field and we will train hard over the next week to try and improve.ldquoYou canrsquot just sit off for  minutes and expect to still be in games.Down: G McMahon, P Fegan, F McElroy, B McArdle R McCormack, N McParland, D OrsquoHagan A Doherty, O Murdock C Mooney, L Kerr, C McCartanB OrsquoHagan , K McKernan, A Gilmore .Subs: C Poland for D OrsquoHagan, P Havern for K McKernan, J McCartan for C Mooney, C Francis for R McCormick, T Close for N McParland.Yellow Card: J McCartanGalway: C Flaherty K Molloy, S Kelly , S McGrath D McHugh, J Daly, C McDaid P Kelly, M Tierney O Gallagher , R Finnerty , F OrsquoLaoi S Walsh , P Conroy , T Culhane .Subs: D Comerfor R Finnerty, P Kelly for F OrsquoLaoi, T Gill for C McDaid, C Sweeney for T Culhane, D Conneely for P Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Poots.jpg","title":"Ministerial approval for  ambitious park proposal  ","story":"EXCITEMENT is building around the multi-million pound revamp of the stunningly picturesque Castlewellan Forest Park.Work is already underway on an ambitious scheme which will focus on a number of key areas as part of the major investment programme aimed at restoring the sprawling forest parkrsquos key heritage features to help maximise its tourism potential.The Heritage Lottery Fund has provided almost pound.m in assistance with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand the EU weighing in with pound,.Construction work is well underway at the Bothy Yard in the forest park with other planned work including new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park an a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue and caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.Funding from the government department and Newry, Mourne and Down Council is financing the restoration of the iconic th century greenhouse, reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11951198.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Most Fed policymakers are leaning towards increasing interest rates, as inflation in the US hits .%.In the UK, it is at a -year high of .%.And remember that it is people or businesses who have borrowed heavily, perhaps even irresponsibly, who gain when inflation is high. The real-terms value of their debt pile is cut by price increases.It is prudent savers who lose out.

Mr Murphy says it is an insult to describe the discrepancy as sectarian but it is not surprising that many football fans will interpret the dferent treatment in that way, particularly when the party defending the stadium decision is so reliably tribal and so reliably opposed to proposals that unionist politicians hold dear.It is appalling that the £ million earmarked for sub-regional stadia is not progressing.It is a huge setback for clubs such as Coleraine FC, which have waited so patiently for improvements, and which had drawn up feasible plans for them.As the IFA CEO Patrick Nelson has said see our back page, local football needs investment.Mr Nelson points out that the sub-regional funding was included in the  New Decade New Approach deal to restore Stormont.The only part of that deal that a Conservative and Unionist government intends to rush through is the part that Sinn Fein demands, relating to the gaelic language.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I’ve worked very well with the IFAand indeed with all sporting codes from when I came into post, I’ve engaged them on a regular basis.“They actually worked very closely with me throughout the pandemic, in not just stabilising those sectors, but also working to address the needs of the community through food parcels and through prescriptions.“This is not a sectarian issue and it’s not a Casement versus sub-regional.”Deidre HargeySinn FeinConor MurphyDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularThis is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea borderStorm warnings for Northern Ireland now include heavy snowBelfast university culture spat: ‘No-one is convinced by efforts to portray the Irish language as cross-community’Northern Ireland Protocol could see a wide range of new regulations imposed on NI, says committee of MPsThe RUC did not help in the aftermath of the McGurk’s bar bombMost PopularBest robot vacuum cleaner UK : top cleaners for pet hair and more from Dyson to SharkHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router extenders  from BT, Netgear, Orbi, and AmazonRoyal Mint releases commemorative £ coin to mark  years of FA CupBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le CreusetMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale now                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The sister in law of dead PUP chief David, who has run Irish classes in loyalist east Belfast for years, said: “Great to see QUB providing the same type of residential scheme that is available in other UK universities.“It will be particularly beneficial for students from PUL backgrounds as often they have less opportunity to practise their language skills outside of the classroom.”MORE FROM THIS REPORTER:Click here: Lawsuits against the state from people interned in Northern Ireland  years ago now number up to Click here: RUC ‘collusive’ findings – WATCH as DUP man denounces IRA while speaker Alex Maskey tries to rein him in for ‘going off-topic’Click here: Catholic   Protestant quotas now in force in  new housing estates – with  more to come——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The next phase would be to transform a three-acre grass area beside the stadium into a G area for community use.The final phase of the vision is for an all-seater stadium with an international-size pitch accommodating between , and , spectators.

We do intend to do that through the [UK Government’s] ‘Levelling Up Fund’.“That in itself would give us a separate area where we could have all our youth groups, community groups, I don’t care who they are as long as the place is thriving, it’s vibrant, being utilised seven days a week.“That is always the aim of the club to bring the community into the area around the club. What it will do is regenerate the area of Coleraine which is an area of deprivation – that’s not me saying that, that is the statistics that are produced for Northern Ireland.”He added: “What we were looking for through the Sub Regional Stadia Programme was to create a North West Regional Stadium with state of the art training facilities and a community hub.“If you’re a team, say from Scotland, who doesn’t want to be going to Spain for pre-season training on an annual basis, Coleraine is right on your doorstep. There’s some great golf courses for a bit of rest and relaxation, great hotels – it all makes sense.”He said: “It was incredibly disappointing but not unexpected when the minister made the announcement.“I sincerely hope that we as a footballing family all come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“I would also strongly support engaging with the Gaelic community, I believe both communities need the facilities.“My thinking is that all the sporting communities should come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“It’s very disappointing that sport finds itself embroiled in a political situation, there are undoubtedly those who are using this is a political weapon, all they’re doing is depriving the youth and prosperity of all of society by their shortsightedness.”He added: “We’re proceeding with all our plans and hopefully further down the line after the election when there’s new candidates in, the money can be resurrected.”Intermediate club Bangor FC planned to use funding from the Department for Communities ill-fated stadia programme as part of the club’s push toto the Premiership.Largely based on cash from Deirdre Hargey’s department, the club – who have been absent from Northern Ireland’s top ision for more than  years – submitted a planning application for a new -seater grandstand and community hub.Bangor FC Chairman Graham Bailie said: “We are extremely disappointed about the news of the funding package for football stadia in Northern Ireland being shelved. “These funds were set to transform football club facilities across Northern Ireland. “A new modern grandstand and community hub are an essential step in the evolution of our plans to bring Premiership football back to Bangor FC. “Our ambition is to continue making progress on the pitch, and supporting the local community off it. “That is why we included a community hub at the heart of this project. “However, it was always dependent on securing a combination of public funds, from the Sub Regional Stadia Programme, and private investment opportunities.” He said the club now needs an answer to the question of whether the funding will now be available in the budget which spans  to . Mr Bailie said: “Bangor is one of the largest conurbations in Northern Ireland, and our continued vision is to upgrade the ground to match this position, as we progress through the leagues andto the Irish Premiership.”Despite the obvious setback, he said: “We need to keep trying to push forward, so as a board we are working through all other options which we think might be available. “The facility upgrade is needed in order for us to continue our progress.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have been able to go above and beyond to provide Welsh households with more help in paying bills, heating homes and putting food on the table..remove“In total we are more than doubling the equivalent support provided by the UK Government for those who need it the most, reflecting our priority of creating a fairer Wales in which no-one is left behind.”Earlier this month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £ of support for households across England to deal with rising energy bills over the year from April .Some £ of the support will take the form of a council tax rebate for all ratepayers in council tax bands A to D.The Treasury also announced that devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would be given a total of £ million extra funding to carry out the same measure.Last week Wales’ first minister Mark Drakeford said there was “no extra money for Wales” from the Treasury to provide the rebate.His claim came after the UK Government’s Welsh secretary accused the devolved Welsh Government of leaving its taxpayers “unclear” about whether they would be getting a £ council tax rebate to help with energy bills.Jane Hutt, minister for social justice in Wales, said: “The funding we are announcing today will ensure more people get more support, in what are challenging circumstances for so many families in Wales.“As bills rise, prices go up and wages are stretched we know people will need help, that’s why I’ve convened a Wales-wide Cost of Living Summit on Thursday  February, with over  participants from a wide range of social partners and third sector organisations across Wales to discuss the crisis and the proactive actions we can take to support people across Wales.“Addressing the cost-of-living crisis remains a crucial priority for this Government and we will continue to consider all the options available to us.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWales’ minister for finance and local government, Rebecca Evans, said the government is “more than doubling the equivalent support provided by the UK Government” for those most in need, as it aims to ensure “no-one is left behind”.The Welsh Government has announced what it described as a package of expanded measures to help people amid rising prices, including a £ cost-of-living payment to be paid as soon as possible and an extra £ for low-income households through the winter fuel payment next winter.The £ payment will be available to all households who live in properties in council tax bands A-D, as well as those in receipt of the Council Tax Reduction Scheme in all bands.The devolved government said it will be working with local authorities to provide more detail about how the scheme will operate and will start making payments as soon as possible.It said a further £ million will be made available as a discretionary fund, allowing councils to use their local knowledge to help households who might be struggling.The government added that in - more than £ million will be provided to strengthen other schemes that help people meet the rising costs of living.More funds will be allocated through the discretionary assistance fund – which helps people pay for essential costs such as food, electricity, clothing and emergency travel – and the winter fuel support scheme, which will deliver an additional £ later this year to hundreds of thousands of low-income households, the government said.Ms Evans, of Welsh Labour, said: “People are facing a very real cost-of-living crisis and urgent, meaningful action is required.“The Chancellor’s offer at the start of the month fell short of what people needed. We have been able to go above and beyond to provide Welsh households with more help in paying bills, heating homes and putting food on the table..remove“In total we are more than doubling the equivalent support provided by the UK Government for those who need it the most, reflecting our priority of creating a fairer Wales in which no-one is left behind.”Earlier this month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £ of support for households across England to deal with rising energy bills over the year from April .Some £ of the support will take the form of a council tax rebate for all ratepayers in council tax bands A to D.The Treasury also announced that devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would be given a total of £ million extra funding to carry out the same measure.Last week Wales’ first minister Mark Drakeford said there was “no extra money for Wales” from the Treasury to provide the rebate.His claim came after the UK Government’s Welsh secretary accused the devolved Welsh Government of leaving its taxpayers “unclear” about whether they would be getting a £ council tax rebate to help with energy bills.Jane Hutt, minister for social justice in Wales, said: “The funding we are announcing today will ensure more people get more support, in what are challenging circumstances for so many families in Wales.“As bills rise, prices go up and wages are stretched we know people will need help, that’s why I’ve convened a Wales-wide Cost of Living Summit on Thursday  February, with over  participants from a wide range of social partners and third sector organisations across Wales to discuss the crisis and the proactive actions we can take to support people across Wales.“Addressing the cost-of-living crisis remains a crucial priority for this Government and we will continue to consider all the options available to us.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a letter to UK immigration minister Kevin Foster, representatives of the three devolved administrations claimed that processes for skilled workers looking to come to Britain were “inflexible, costly and bureaucratic” and had also served to “exclude many of the key workers that we need, many of whom have been crucial during the Covid- pandemic”.The letter, from Wales social justice minister, Jane Hutt, Scottish Europe minister, Neil Gray, and Northern Ireland economy minister, Gordon Lyons, states there are “severe labour and skills shortages” in all four nations of the UK.But they claim the UK Government has failed to “work constructively” with the devolved administrations to try to tackle the problem.The Welsh, Scottish, and Northern Irish politicians insisted the Home Office should “immediately reintroduce” regular four-way meetings where such issues can be discussed.They told Mr Foster: “The UK Government has said it wants the immigration system to work for all parts of the UK.“Without a commitment to regular and meaningful engagement with the devolved governments, this is simply not possible.”UK ministers were also urged to “immediately review the immigration skills and health surcharges and reduce additional fees”, with Governments in Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast arguing these can be an “insurmountable barrier for both workers and employers”.They added: “As it stands, the UK has one of the most costly immigration systems and this cannot continueit is to be an attractive destination for global talent moving forward.”Ms Hutt, Mr Gray, and Mr Lyons repeated calls for the devolved administrations to be given a formal role in deciding which occupations there is a shortage of in their nations, in a bid to make it easier to recruit overseas workers to these posts..remove“We call upon the UK Government to act urgently,” they said.The three ministers told Mr Foster it was critical that their administrations are involved in the issue, arguing: “Migration is a cross-cutting policy area affecting many aspects of devolved competency including the economy, housing, healthcare and the delivery of local services.”However they claimed: “Sadly in spite of our efforts, the UK Government has consistently failed to consult, collaborate, or work constructively with the devolved Governments on any changes pertaining to the immigration system.“This is despite the severe labour and skills shortages faced across all four nations which can largely be attributed to the excessively restrictive UK immigration system.”They added: “We are doing everything within our respective powers to ensure that the needs of businesses are met, but the action we take must be supplemented by immediate changes to the immigration system in order to quickly access the labour and skills our nations need to survive the current crisis.”A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: “Our points-based immigration system is focused on talent and skills and makes it much easier for the brightest and best to live and study in the UK.“We continue to engage with the devolved administrations on immigration policies but it is important that employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebaacdfbcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffadeafeefeaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1606908037252.jpg--remaining_northern_ireland_coronavirus_laws_lifted.jpg?160690804100","title":"remaining northern ireland coronavirus laws lifted ","story":"The remaining coronavirus restrictions and face-covering regulations are to be scrapped, Health Minister Robin Swann has confirmed. They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.

The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign.
