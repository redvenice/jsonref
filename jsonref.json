She wasn\u0027t looking at him now. So much the better. He didn\u0027t want her watching him as he jumped off.So long as no one was watching he would be able to say afterwards that he had slipped and fallen by accident.He peered over the side of the ship. It was a long, long drop. Come to think of it now, he might easily hurt himself badly if he hit the water flat. Wasn\u0027t there someone who once split his stomach open that way, doing a belly flop from a high e? He must jump straight and land feet first. Go in like a knife. Yes, sir.The water seemed cold and deep and grey and it made him shiver to look at it. But it was now or never. Be a man, William Botibol, be a man. All right then... now... here goes...He climbed up on to the wide wooden toprail, stood there poised, balancing for three terrifying seconds, then he leaped - he leaped up and out as far as he could go and at the same time he shouted, \u0027Help!\u0027\u0027Help! Help! \u0027 he shouted as he fell. Then he hit the water and went under.When the first shout for help sounded, the woman who was leaning on the rail started up and gave a little jump of surprise. She looked around quickly and saw sailing past her through the air this small man dressed in white shorts and tennis shoes, spread-eagled and shouting as he went.For a moment she looked as though she weren\u0027t quite sure what she ought to do: throw a life belt, run away and give the alarm, or simply turn and yell. She drew back a pace from the rail and swung half round facing up to the bridge, and for this brief moment she remained motionless, tense, undecided.Then almost at once she seemed to relax, and she leaned forward far over the rail, staring at the water, where it was turbulent in the ship\u0027s wake.Soon a tiny round black head appeared in the foam, an arm was raised about it, once, twice, vigorously waving, and a small faraway voice was heard calling something that was difficult to understand. The woman leaned still farther over the rail, trying to keep the little bobbing black speck in sight, but soon, so very soon, it was such a long way away that she couldn\u0027t even be sure it was there at all.After a while another woman came out on deck. This one was bony and angular, and she wore horn-rimmed spectacles. She spotted the first woman and walked over to her, treading the deck in the deliberate, military fashion of all spinsters.\u0027So there you are,\u0027 she said.The woman with the fat ankles turned and looked at her, but said nothing.\u0027I\u0027ve been searching for you,\u0027 the bony one continued. \u0027Searching all over.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s very odd,\u0027 the woman with the fat ankles said. \u0027A man ed overboard just now, with his clothes on.\u0027\u0027Nonsense!\u0027\u0027Oh yes. He said he wanted to get some exercise and he ed in and didn\u0027t even bother to take his clothes off.\u0027\u0027You better come down now,\u0027 the bony woman said. Her mouth had suddenly become firm, her whole face sharp and alert, and she spoke less kindly than before.\u0027And don\u0027t you ever go wandering about on deck alone like this again. You know quite well you\u0027re meant to wait for me.\u0027\u0027Yes, Maggie,\u0027 the woman with the fat ankles answered, and again she smiled, a tender, trusting smile, and she took the hand of the other one and allowed herself to be led away across the deck.\u0027Such a nice man,\u0027 she said. \u0027He waved to me.\u0027DIP IN THE POOL was first published in 1952 and is taken from Madness: Fear And Unreason by Roald Dahl, published by Penguin at £8.99 and also available in ebook and audiobook. © The Roald Dahl Story Company Ltd."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/211f10666914978674785bd92226ed70be32a3e3/0_0_2700_1749/master/2700.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06a6d2eec6abaf68cca9c6ed96dbbda8 1010w","title":"discovery of letters shines light on thomas hardys second marriage","story":"Author’s second wife, Florence Dugdale, tells of celebrity pressures, and joy at living with ‘one of the kindest men in the world’Touching newly discovered letters written by Thomas Hardy’s second wife reveal her joy at their union and, later, her sadness at life without the great author after his death – but also highlight the media pressure the celebrity couple faced more than a century ago.In a letter written shortly after their wedding, Florence Dugdale portrayed Hardy as “one of the kindest, most humane men in the world” while acknowledging that his fame led to the constant attention of the press in the UK and US.A letter sent after Hardy’s death includes a vivid image of her sitting in the room where she first met her late husband, a French bulldog snoring by the fire as her only companion.Hardy’s first marriage – to Emma Gifford – has tended to garner more attention, partly because so much of his great work, including the elegiac “Poems of 1912-13”, was inspired by her.Academics believe the three recently found letters are significant because they offer fresh insight into his relationship with Florence, a teacher and author, in his later years.The first letter was sent by Florence from Max Gate, Hardy’s home on the outskirts of Dorchester in Dorset on 10 February 1914 to a former pupil of hers called Harold Barlow, who was away working in Africa.Florence wrote: “Perhaps you have read, if you have the English papers, that I am now the proud and very happy wife of the greatest living English writer – Thomas Hardy.“Although he is much older than myself, it is a genuine love match – on my part, at least, for I suppose I ought not to speak for him. At any rate I know I have for a husband one of the kindest, most humane men in the world.”Florence also wrote about how she was weary of celebrity culture and the media: “Accounts of me \u0026amp my portrait have been printed in every paper, I think, in England. I have been shown in the Cinematograph, written about all over America \u0026amp Europe. I am tired of this publicity.”The letters were kept by Barlow’s daughter, Josephine Barlow, and found after her death by his grandsons, Ian and Colin Nicol. The letters have been passed to Prof Angelique Richardson, of the University of Exeter, who is leading the Hardy’s Correspondents Project, as part of which letters connected to the author are being digitised.Richardson said: “It is rare to find such significant letters. They give an intimate glimpse into life at Max Gate and the loves and losses Florence shared with Hardy. It also shows us more about Florence, how self-deprecating she was and how devoted she was to her husband.”The second and third letters to Barlow were written 18 years later, in 1932, four years after Hardy’s death.She said: “I am writing this late in the evening alone, in the room where I first met my husband. A little French bull-dog is snoring by the fire – he is my faithful – \u0026amp generally my only – companion.”Florence added: “I thank you for your kind words of sympathy about my great loss. It was such a wonderful thing to live in close association with that great mind \u0026amp that noble personality. After having lived 14 years with such a companion it is little wonder that I feel intolerably lonely – \u0026amp find the world very empty.”The letters will be placed with the rest of Dorset Museum’s Hardy Collection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0b15be7aa98927a12bdf52f35c16466a37eb57/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcaaef91784ff247ab9f5e641e4a3152","title":"lengthy lockdown unrealistic says former bank of england governor","story":"Offer self-employed swifter help, Mervyn King says, and consider a Covid-19 lockdown exit planMervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England at the time of the 2008 global financial crisis, has warned that an indefinite Covid-19 lockdown is unrealistic and ministers need to work on an exit strategy.Lord King said he understood the reasons for quarantining most of the population, but that there would be a backlash if the restrictions were kept in place for too long.Speaking at a webinar organised by the Policy Exchange thinktank, King said: “The idea that you can have a lockdown that goes on for months on end is unrealistic. The government needs an exit strategy, which may be gradual and initially involve those who have had the virus and are able to travel and go back to work. If we have a lockdown for too long there will be a rebellion against it.”King said it was pointless to speculate on the extent of the health and economic damage caused by the crisis, but emphasised that there would be significant costs in terms of failed businesses, lost jobs and increased unhappiness.“It is understandable that health officials focus on the broad-brush aspect of this – the need for a lockdown to diminish the spread of the virus,” he said.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.But the former Bank governor said it was also important to think about the mental health of people being made unemployed, or whose businesses were going bust.“There are people struggling to get out to buy food and who are stuck on their own. Young people are having their university education and school exams cancelled, and that it is going to have a significant impact of their wellbeing and future careers.”King added the government had made a deliberate decision to lock down the economy and so had a responsibility to ensure cash flow to businesses big and small, and to act as the customer of last resort.The Treasury needed to speed up its plan to offer financial help to the self-employed because the target date of early June would be too late for many, he said.Alistair Darling, the chancellor responsible for bailing out stricken banks at the beginning of the 2008 crisis, said the government was failing to provide a consistent message on testing for Covid-19.“It is critical in any crisis that the message has clarity”, Darling said. “At the moment we don’t know whether the government is going beyond NHS staff to the public as a whole. Unless we know who has got it or who has had it, we are always going to be on the back foot.”Darling also said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, needed to make sure measures were having an impact where they were needed.“It is very easy to announce a policy, but much more difficult to get it delivered. The economic measures are absolutely vital, but for the self-employed delivery is going to take longer than people have got in many cases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fb69ef4ba2701bde80f4f81d0ba2864fefbd26/0_251_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac62ffe7641ea706d3cee70fe37b4da","title":"doctors choose life saving treatment ethical rules","story":"Robust ethical rules on coronavirus are vital to guide us to the right decision, however agonisingThe headlines are stark: a “tsunami” of Covid-19 patients moving inexorably toward London’s hospitals and then spreading out across the rest of the UK. Despite heroic efforts to increase supply – and reduce demand – there may come a point when this tsunami will simply overwhelm intensive-care beds, ventilators and life-support machines. Although we hope this will not be happen, it is important we begin to think now about how we would respond should that situation arise. As in Spain and Italy, heart-wrenching decisions may need to be made, agonising choices about who gets access to life-saving interventions. Should there be a disjunction between need and resource, these decisions will become unavoidable. The question is how do we ensure decisions made are ethical?Over recent weeks, we at the British Medical Association have worked with leading medical figures to put together guidelines to ensure just this. This guidance is clear, authoritative, ethically robust, and developed with a broad range of input and opinion designed to support doctors as they approach these most trying of decisions.Sadly, these guidelines do not preclude the necessity to make enormously challenging ethical decisions. Guidance can indicate how to proceed. It cannot stop the choices being brutal or relieve decision-makers of their moral distress.Looking ahead to the coming weeks, if hard choices are required, we know they will be contested. There will be anger and pain. People who, in normal circumstances, would receive intensive treatment may instead be given palliation – pain relief without a cure - in order to favour those with greater likelihood of benefiting. Nobody wants to take these decisions, but if resources are overwhelmed, they will have to be made.In taking them, we need to begin with justice or fairness. If everyone matters equally, but we cannot treat all of those in need, what does a fair allocation of resources look like? In times of plenty, fairness means allocating resources according to medical need. The greater the demand, the greater the resources provided – as long as the patient will benefit. Even before Covid-19, the NHS was not amply equipped. Resources were being rationed by way of waiting lists and brevity of consultation. But – generally – the more ill you were, the greater a priority you were.For a time, Covid-19 may overturn this approach. The question will no longer be how best to meet inidual need, but how to maximise benefits from severely stretched resources. To the criterion of medical need, must also be added the patient’s likelihood of benefiting. It is preferable to save the lives of three patients with high need and a high likelihood of benefiting than one patient with high need and a low – but nonetheless real – chance of benefiting. The principle that everyone matters is in tension with the requirement to maximise overall benefit. This is the heart of the moral challenge.The BMA’s guidance addresses the ethical aspects of these difficult decisions. It is designed to support doctors. But, at this time, there will undoubtedly be challenges. Objective clinical standards can be indirectly discriminatory. We know that the presence of comorbidities – having more than one illness or condition – or underlying frailty is associated with higher risks for patients with Covid-19. An approach based solely on clinically relevant factors may, statistically, prioritise the younger and, where clinically relevant, it may discriminate against those with underlying health conditions. We need to be alert to this. We need to keep practice under regular review and modify it as more evidence and feedback become available. Neither age nor disability in themselves will be criteria – only where they impact on a patient’s capacity to benefit.And what if there are more patients with capacity to benefit than life-saving resources available? There are two options, neither of them ideal. More likely is a modified queueing system based on the widely accepted principle “first come, first served”. Patients who become critically ill earlier will be more likely to be admitted to intensive care or receive mechanical ventilation than those who become similarly ill later on, even though they may be offered intensive support for a defined but limited period. While such an approach is procedurally simple, and arguably fair, it is not without its challenges. It gives priority to those who are mobile, who have access to transport or who live close to hospitals. The alternative is some form of lottery, but pity those who would have to manage it.These are unprecedented times. Our health system – like our society itself – is facing its gravest challenge since the second world war. Given the vital importance of these decisions – and the inevitability of dissent – there must be a national debate now, in advance of these decisions having to be taken. Public acceptance requires an understanding of why these decisions must be made, and the rationale for the way in which they are made. I write in the hope of contributing to that debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72e53cef3f973e3e605584b9b5d33157d8796dab/0_0_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1de0c62638b55e75a7ee541ab6cdaf2","title":"lockdown buys time virus mass testing coronavirus uk","story":"Instead of endless mass isolation or just waiting for a cure, the UK needs a data-driven, targeted approach to coronavirus testing After squandering valuable time to prepare for the spread of Covid-19 in February and the first half of March, the government made a dramatic U-turn and put the country into lockdown two weeks ago. But amid the drama of shutting down our entire way of life – with kids out of school, shops closed and millions working from home – we appear to have forgotten that lockdown itself is not the solution to coronavirus. It is simply a means of slowing its spread and buying time – while we race to catch up.The real question facing Britain now is how to most effectively make up for lost time: what can we really do to fight this instead of simply cowering in our homes and waiting for it to blow over? If things carry on much as they are now, one possible scenario is that we will find ourselves in an endless cycle of lockdown and release over the next year – while the population slowly acquires the virus and hopefully gains immunity.The burden on the NHS will be tremendous, especially given concerns about lack of appropriate personal protective equipment, and this will have knock-on effects on other services it offers: routine surgery, cancer treatment, the ability to deal with emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes. The decision whether to extend lockdown will be made by looking at the modelling of NHS capacity in three weeks’ time as well as assessing public willingness to comply.In an optimistic version of the above, over the next three to four months an antiviral therapy would be discovered while we hold out for a vaccine. Antiviral therapies would give doctors an additional tool to treat critical patients with, while vaccines would provide a prevention measure so iniduals can build up immunity and the necessary antibodies before being exposed to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Effective therapies have helped with how we deal with HIVAids (antiretrovirals), malaria (antimalarials) while vaccines have been effective against measles, mumps and rubella. Repurposing a drug that has already been tested for safety in humans would be the quickest path, and clinical trials are taking place for antimalarial cocktails (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), remdesivir and plasma therapies, which involve extracting antibodies from recovered patients and injecting them into ill patients.The endgame would be a vaccine that is widely available, effective and affordable. Currently there are about two dozen vaccine candidates, with several being tested on animals and one imminently due to begin testing on humans. However, time is the problem, as vaccines require three phases of clinical trials to test for safety, side effects and whether they actually work. It will take about a year to 18 months even if all goes to plan – and even then, given all countries would be looking to acquire the vaccine, manufacturing enough of it would present a further challenge.But instead of quarantining the entire population (and assuming anyone could be carrying the virus), the most pragmatic way out would be via a more nuanced and data-driven approach of mass-testing 75-100,000 people per day. This would not be testing random people but rather those presenting with symptoms, and then tracing all of their contacts (household members, colleagues, flatmates) to ensure they are also tested. All those who are virus-carriers would be put into a mandatory two-week quarantine in their homes, enforced through tracking and fines. This will allow the public health community to identify where exactly the virus is, to break further chains of transmission and to keep case numbers low and within the NHS capacity limit. It would also allow most of society, and the economy, to continue on a somewhat more “normal” basis.The testing capacity could be built up through using private and university labs, as well as working with South Korea and other partners to bring in rapid diagnostics as quickly as possible. SD Biosensor, a company in South Korea, is making 350,000 test kits a day and is scaling up, but currently is prioritising the US, United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. When a reliable antibody test is available, one that shows whether someone has had it or not, iniduals with high likelihood of exposure should be tested to see what percentage of immunity has built up and ensure they can be kept in the workforce.If we want to work towards the best-case scenario, then we need to place the highest political priority on acquiring the testing kits, while drawing on apps and big data to support contact tracing. Through this path we can start quarantining only those carrying the virus, and not the entire population. The economy, society and health all win in this plan, and it seems the best way out of our current situation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821fa35dbf124cfa1e34a5e4530a4c2467342d29/50_0_4400_2642/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d0f09cc9d9f0accc86181f666ffba8","title":"policing under coronavirus the real test is yet to come","story":"As the pandemic wears on, how long will we allow ourselves to be policed by consent? At the end of The Long Goodbye, Raymond Chandler’s detective Philip Marlowe bids farewell to his readers and to the characters in the novel. “I never saw any of them again – except the cops,” muses Marlowe. “No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.” Chandler was expressing a wider truth. In the words of the British criminologist Robert Reiner: “Welcome or unwelcome, protectors, pigs or pariahs, the police are an inevitable fact of modern life.”Especially, we are again learning, in a national emergency. The Coronavirus Act 2020 has given a ratchet to three of the most persistently controversial themes in British policing history: police powers, police discretion and police coordination. All three are back in the spotlight in the Covid-19 lockdown. But this week’s arguments, prompted in part by the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption’s warnings about the growth of a police state, are only the start. The real test for the policing of the pandemic is yet to come.Ever since the creation of London’s politan police in 1829, issues like these have been recurrent in the often volatile evolution of relations between politics, the police and the people. When the state took wide new powers last month they again became a source of argument. Police chiefs have not always appeared in control of events at a time when government is itself struggling to coordinate public discipline over travel, exercise and shopping.The Coronavirus Act is in some ways a recognisable descendent of the draconian emergency legislation that Britain adopted at the start of the world wars of the 20th century. But in some ways it is different. By and large, the wartime emergency legislation granted wide new powers to central government, which was then free to make regulations to apply them. But the 2020 act also gives many powers to the devolved authorities and confers other powers directly on public health, immigration and police officers at local level. As a result, a degree of potential inconsistency between nations, localities and even inidual services was baked into the legislation at the start. Devolvers will approve. Centralisers will not. Much remains in need of sensible clarification.The different approaches so far are often arbitrary. Derbyshire police have used drones to highlight people walking in the Peak District and dye to deter swimmers from a quarry pool near Buxton. This attracted the wrath of Lord Sumption, who called the policing disgraceful. But other forces are also doing things that, in other circumstances, would be highly controversial too. North Yorkshire are using soldiers to conduct roadblocks. Cumbria issued a unilateral decree that the Lake District was “closed”. Devon and Cornwall police asked the public to report “illegal gatherings”. The politan police are challenging users of the London Underground to justify their journeys. Some of these acts can reasonably be justified, but others are plainly excessive.Some of these interventions echo wartime restrictions. At some stage in the current outbreak there may well be a protest picket somewhere against, perhaps, a supermarket over food prices or a bank for not lending to small businesses or the self employed. The picket may comply with all the physical distancing guidance and be dignified and orderly. But it would probably elicit the same response as a protest reported by the civil rights campaigner Ronald Kidd in his wartime book, British Liberty in Danger. In June 1940, police tried to ban a meeting in south London against high food prices because, the police said, “it was undesirable that ‘ill-feeling should be stirred up at a time of crisis’”. That meeting eventually took place. A protest today might run up against the same response and be banned.Today’s events are reminding a new generation of police chiefs and officers that relations with the public are always contingent. For generations, police in this country have set great store by the notion that they police “by consent” rather than by imposition. They like to think it distinguishes them from an un-British “gendarmerie”, against whom the Chartists protested in the early days of the Met. But “policing by consent” is often used, by both police and their critics, in unrealistic and idealised ways. Margaret Thatcher, for example, once said the police need “support and not criticism”. Approaches like that bear no relation to complex social realities, not least in emergencies.Policing is a public good, but it is simultaneously a confrontational activity. It is a mistake to dismiss all policing as authoritarian. But nor is it the case that policing is just another public service. Consent, whether to policing or anything else, is always conditional. Consent has to be won and given, negotiated and sustained. Consent routinely involves invoking and accepting some degree of power. What is consent for some may be imposition for others. That goes with the territory. Consent may be problematic, but it is nevertheless crucial. Today’s police chiefs properly invoke policing by consent. Greater Manchester’s chief constable Ian Hopkins, in his public statement this week said, rightly, that mistakes had been made in policing the lockdown and that some officers would get things wrong. The Met’s assistant commissioner Neil Basu did the same thing when he wrote that policing by consent remained the mantra even in “a period of readjustment to our new responsibilities”.No one should be surprised that the appropriateness of various forms of policing has come to a head again in a time of pandemic. The state, after all, has just claimed unusual powers to direct our lives for the common and inidual good. Those powers need to be debated – which parliament did not do – before they receive consent. The entire episode embodies what the philosopher Benedict de Spinoza wrote in 1670. “It is not, I contend, the purpose of the state to turn rational beings into beasts or automata, but rather to allow their minds and bodies to develop in their own ways in security and enjoy the free use of reason …. Therefore, the true purpose of the state is in fact freedom.”These early days of the policing of the pandemic are nevertheless relatively straightforward. Public consent is currently high. Most of us probably think that it is irresponsible to test the law to the limits by, say, heading off in the car to climb Snowdon.The much more difficult and demanding test will come in a few weeks, when someone in authority says that we have probably reached a stage where some of the restrictions can be lessened and aspects of the old normality resumed. That will be the point when Spinoza’s “free use of reason” will pose a far larger threat to the state’s coronavirus policy. That will be the moment when the policing of what is normal and abnormal, responsible and irresponsible, good freedom and bad freedom will become more complex, chaotic and confrontational. It could be a long hot summer. We all need to start thinking about it now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c15b6e00b7a07c6040d86ff2f6e1c8a8e3f6fef/0_32_3700_2221/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12653a1ad3a7c864eee533b5c2477c96","title":"oceans can be restored to former glory within 30 years say scientists","story":"Major review reports recovery of marine life but a redoubling of efforts is still needed The glory of the world’s oceans could be restored within a generation, according to a major new scientific review.

The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high.However, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels.“We have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,” said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. “Failing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.”Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review’s international team, said: “Overfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration.“One of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back. We can turn the oceans around and we know it makes sense economically, for human wellbeing and, of course, for the environment.”The review, published in the journal Nature, found that global fishing is slowly becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In places from Tampa Bay, Florida to the Philippines, the habitats are being restored.Among the success stories are humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica to eastern Australia, whose populations have surged from a few hundred animals in 1968, before whaling was banned, to more than 40,000 today. Sea otters in western Canada have risen from just dozens in 1980 to thousands now. In the Baltic Sea, both grey seal and cormorant populations are soaring.“We’re beginning to appreciate the value of what we’re losing and not just in terms of intrinsic beauty of the wildlife but in terms of protecting our livelihoods and societies from bad things happening, whether that be poor water quality in rivers and oceans or sea level rise beating on the doorstep of coastal areas,” said Roberts.However, progress is far from straightforward. Pollution from farms and plastics still pours into the oceans, the waters are reaching record high temperatures, and destructive fishing is still taking place in many places, with at least one-third of fish stocks overexploited.“The Mediterranean is still pretty much a basket case,” said Roberts. “And there is horrendous overfishing throughout large parts of south-east Asia and India, where fisheries are just catching anything they trawl on the seabed to render into fish meal and oil.”The global heating of the oceans has driven the few hundred surviving northern right whales along the coast of the western Atlantic. Here, amid busy shipping lanes and lobster fisheries, they are killed by collisions or drowned in a tangle of ropes, according to Roberts, though new regulations are starting to help.The Gulf of Mexico suffers massive dead zones owing to huge amounts of manure and fertiliser running off midwest farms, and elsewhere albatrosses continue to be snared by long-line fishers, despite simple solutions being available.But examples of the benefits of restorative habits were growing, Roberts said, from the return of once abundant oyster beds that can clean huge volumes of water, to marine protected areas that can boost fishery catches nearby, such as by the Scottish island of Arran.The scientists’s review concludes that restoring the oceans by 2050 is a grand challenge that, with a global redoubling of conservation efforts, can be achieved: “Meeting the challenge would be a historic milestone in humanity’s quest to achieve a globally sustainable future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4dc71e26bdf76bae6bf41add96832b25ab05084/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4adad9f42df5773a59a037375746f0c","title":"uk likely to postpone cop26 un climate talks glasgow coronavirus","story":"Crucial UN conference will be delayed until next year as a result of the coronavirus crisisThe UN climate talks due to be held in Glasgow later this year have been postponed as governments around the world struggle to halt the spread of coronavirus.The most important climate negotiations since the Paris agreement in 2015 were scheduled to take place this November to put countries back on track to avoid climate breakdown. They will now be pushed back to 2021.A statement from the UN on Wednesday night confirmed that the meeting of over 26,000 attendees would be delayed until next year. It said new dates for the conference would be decided in due course.The UK energy minister and president of the Cop26 conference, Alok Sharma, held crunch talks with the UN and several other countries on Wednesday evening to confirm the timing of the summit. “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule Cop26,” he said.“We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference.”The Cop26 meeting was scheduled to be held in Glasgow at the SEC arena, a venue that the Scottish government plans to turn into a field hospital to treat virus victims.The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to delay the vital talks because of the widespread disruption caused by coronavirus, and will also delay a key preliminary meeting scheduled for Bonn, Germany, which was also expected to be derailed by widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions.John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said it was vital that the delay should not allow governments to back down on their commitments to tackle the climate crisis. “The decision to postpone the climate talks in Glasgow was inevitable given the health emergency the world is currently facing,” he told the . “But while the summit has been delayed, the climate emergency can’t be put on hold. Government stimulus packages will hold the key as to whether this emergency significantly delays or advances progress on tackling the climate emergency.”Some campaigners believe there could be another advantage to delay, as the US presidential elections take place this November, just before Cop26 was scheduled to begin. With the summit delayed to next year, other governments will have time to adjust either to a second term of Donald Trump – who opposes the Paris agreement and is withdrawing the US from it – or a new president who is likely to support climate action.But several prominent climate experts had feared that delaying the talks would mean governments eased off on pursuing stronger commitments to fulfil the Paris goals.Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who oversaw the Paris summit in 2015, had argued for keeping Glasgow on track. On Wednesday night she accepted the delay but added: “Emissions must peak this year if we want to limit warming to 1.5C and the Paris agreement set the Cop26 summit as the moment when all countries would ramp up their targets in line with the steep emissions decline we need to see in this decisive next decade.”The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) welcomed the delay as the best hope of rebuilding diplomatic momentum before the talks take place. Stephanie Pfeifer, the group’s CEO, said investors would support the decision because it “improves the likelihood of a strong outcome and ensuring that the world is put on a path to tackle the climate crisis”.But the delay will come as a blow to some climate campaigners, who have urged the UK government to proceed with the conference despite the outbreak to avoid stalling progress on global climate action. They believe since the Paris agreement, countries have failed to develop climate commitments that go far enough to avoid a catastrophic environmental breakdown. The Glasgow talks aim to galvanise tougher plans to cap rising temperatures by limiting greenhouse gas emissions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f259ccc6f9e0cb344c168b193f52539e93890bcf/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1b09fdaf5987ca2b0d644936f48761e","title":"what wildlife can you see from your home coronavirus","story":"If you are locked down in an urban area due to coronavirus, we want to know what flora and fauna you can see from your homeLocked down in a city?

But I know what it’s about – don’t I?I’ve never seen a Jean-Luc Godard movie. Or, I hadn’t, until this assignment. I know, embarrassing, especially for a so-called film critic. I’ve long blamed this gap in my knowledge on the fact that I didn’t take a first year university course in French New Wave cinema, but I know as well as anyone you don’t need to be a student to study. It’s not even that the Nouvelle Vague is a blind spot, necessarily – I’m an admirer of other films from the movement, such as Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, Agnés Varda’s Cléo de 5 à 7, François Truffaut’s Jules et Jim and Jacques Demy’s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. I’ve been known to treat my lack of interest in Godard’s filmography as something of a comedy bit, joking that I simply prefer Truffaut (he’s less of a basic bitch).With French film journal Cahiers du Cinéma (RIP) back in the news after its writers quit en masse this February, it feels like an appropriate time to revisit some of the film-makers made famous by the magazine following its launch in 1951. Rohmer, Rivette, Chabrol, Truffaut, and, yes, fine, Godard, were early champions of auteurism, the theory that the director is king. Now the most widely accepted way to read a film, at the time it represented radical rejection of commercial cinema, which tailored to a studio’s whims and centred on the screenwriter. And so, with some trepidation, I cued up Godard’s first and most famous film, his 1960 debut À Bout de Souffle.I know this film, I thought, despite never having watched it. I know the monochrome imagery, the jump cuts, the cigarette dangling from Jean-Paul Belmondo’s mouth. I know Jean Seberg’s Breton stripes, her gamine pixie haircut and her New York Herald Tribune T-shirt. What I didn’t know was what the film was actually about. Something about a guy, and a girl, and a car, I’d guessed. Turns out, I wasn’t far off.Michel (Belmondo) steals a car and shoots a policeman attempting to lay low in Paris, he ends up in the hotel room of former fling Patricia (Seberg), an American studying at the Sorbonne. The plot is inspired by film noir, but the vérité-style handheld camera, real locations and naturalistic speech transform it from a pulpy gangster thriller into a hangout movie. There’s sex, betrayal and an antihero to anchor the narrative, but hard-boiled dialogue is swapped for digressive, philosophical rambling, in-jokes and winking addresses to the audience. “I’m a sonofabitch,” Michel says, direct to camera. Ah, I realised. This is what people mean when they say Godard changed the grammar of cinema.Godard’s influence on New Hollywood cinema and directors such as Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Brian de Palma started to become clear, especially in the constant chatter and casual violence. And, I guess, the sexism. Michel is a self-described scumbag but it doesn’t quite let him off the hook for declaring all women drivers “cowardice personified”, refusing to pick up two female hitchhikers because they’re “too ugly” and the fetishisation of Patricia’s constituent body parts. I imagine Godard thought it romantic to describe the lovely “gleam” in Patricia’s eyes that emerged when she was “afraid and confused”. I found it disturbing. In another scene, Patricia is trying to have an intelligent conversation about William Faulkner. “Show me your toes,” replies a horny, distracted Michel (hello, Quentin Tarantino).Still, I didn’t hate it. I didn’t hate it at all. I found myself drawn in by the irrepressible buoyancy of its narrative rhythms. I liked how the improvised jazz score creates the feeling of spontaneity. I was into the spirited sexual energy that animates the film and, clearly, the film-maker as Paris entered a new decade after the stifling conformity of the 1950s. Which Godard film shall I watch next?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7395900246f284212b3b1d07ca7d629e55c47a4/0_303_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65cb2a9c4daf970113bc88b536a4dc47","title":"hop to it researchers pinpoint why belgian beers dont keep","story":"Study finds fashionable hoppy brews lose their characteristic taste while sitting on the shelfIt will be music to the ears of Belgian beer enthusiasts: drink up.Scientists studying how well the fashionable hoppy-tasting beers of today keep in the cupboard have highlighted the particular propensity for them to lose their flavour over time.According to a paper produced by the Catholic University of Louvain, the humulones and cis-humulinones compounds vital to their hoppy taste degrade dramatically within two years of storage.The finding will have particular resonance for some in this period of stockpiling. In the days that immediately followed the coronavirus lockdown in the UK, the website of the retailer Majestic Wine crashed amid fears of a shortage of alcohol.The academics from the Belgian city of Louvain behind the study, Ferreira Silva Guimarães, Antonio Carlos and Sonia Collin, examined the changes in the “bitterness units” in 21 Belgian dry-hopped beers.While it has long been known that the flavour of beer changes over time, the impact of age on highly hopped and especially dry hopped beers has not been examined. In recent years, sales have been on the rise for beers made with strongly flavoured hops derived from the Humulus lupulus plant, or with whole hops added in the fermentation process.The scientists report that humulones, cis-humulinones and hulupones are key to the “sensory and measured bitterness of these beers”.Belgium is Europe’s biggest exporter of beer, according to the latest statistics produced by the Brewers of Europe federation, with exports of 15.8m hectolitres followed by Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Germany consumed the most beer in 2018, followed by the UK, Spain and Poland.A number of Belgian brewers and distilleries, including Stokerij Rubbens, De Moor and Filliers, have switched to the production of disinfecting hand gel in recent weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cd9db282fee155899a11f681ceb44988019fa01/0_122_4374_2625/master/4374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0405f60a5186f25f8eff561e0d4acd60","title":"womens euro 2021 in england postponed by a year says danish fa","story":"The women’s European Championship, which was due to be held in England next summer, has been postponed until 2022, according to the Danish FA.

But many people have not only lived but thrived in similar circumstances. A polar scientist, a monk, a solo sailor and more offer tipsDierickx is a postdoctoral fellow in experimental cosmology at Harvard, and spends two to three months a year at the Amundsen-Scott station at the south pole carrying out maintenance on her department’s telescopes. “It’s a very unchanging environment and you can’t really go outside,” Dierickx says, “so a lot of the psychological implications are similar to what we are experiencing now. I found that in my time there I would try to control my environment more. For example, we have lab space there and I would obsessively clean it, and I am doing the same thing now, stuck in my apartment.”Dierickx, 29, also becomes very attentive to change. “Things like plants that grow noticeably or changing the decor of your room. It’s a good way to channel energy,” she says. “Nurturing our environment can only help our psychological balance.”How does she find living in such close proximity to a small group of people? “That is one of the main challenges,” she says. “Especially if there is someone you don’t get along with. I’ve found that I have to proactively use my good side, try to repair relationships and work on my generosity. I confront people with kindness.”Ramsey captained the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Turbulent from 2008-11. “Submariners are trained to deal with isolation, whereas the public aren’t,” he says. “For the general public, it’s a wicked problem that they’re trying to tame. “The first thing to do is get into a routine. It needs discipline. Do the same things in the same order every day. Make the weekends different. You have to differentiate time.”Ramsey suggests limiting your exposure to TV news. “The constant news is such a dynamic change at the moment and it’s all negative,” he says. “Picking it up once a day will give you time to do other stuff.” He also stresses the importance of exercise. “If you are healthy physically, you will be healthy mentally. I used to exercise with dumbbells in my cabin, which was tiny. And keep mentally fit as well. It’s about reading books and doing something different. This is an ideal opportunity to learn something new.”He describes a submarine as “a steel tube with 130 people in it” and admits there can be friction on a long deployment. “De-conflict early,” he says. “Have a chat find out what the issues are.”His final piece of advice is to “enjoy what’s there”. Focus on what you have got rather than what you are being denied. “Try to stay off the topic of what happens next,” he says. “You can only control what you can control.” Jamison is president of the English Benedictine Congregation and author of Finding Happiness: Monastic Steps for a Fulfilling Life. Drawing on almost 50 years experience as a monk, he has helped set up a website, alonetogether.org.uk, which addresses loneliness and self-sufficiency raised by the current crisis.“The whole country is going through waves of different feelings,” Jamison says. “One that came up most in the early stages was anger. People were angry with people in supermarkets angry with people who were stockpiling angry with people who didn’t stay at home. There is also a lot of fear around and, later, people will feel lonely and bored.”How does the monastic tradition help counter such feelings? “If you just leave the day undifferentiated, it can get on top of you. But if you create your own rhythm, you’ll find that the day is more sustainable, bearable and enjoyable.”Jamison draws a distinction between boredom and lethargy. “Boredom is when there is absolutely nothing to do. Lethargy is when there are things to do that you can’t be bothered doing. Most people suffer the latter, but they call it the former because it lets them off the hook. In the monastery, people are always ringing bells telling you what to do next, so you don’t have time to be bored.”Positivity is the key. “Do not begin the day by rehearsing your grievances. Begin by remembering you’re alive and there are good things still. You may have to do tough things later, but take it one step at a time. Begin with gratitude then ask for the grace to face the day and its difficulties. Then go and address the difficulties.” Doesn’t all that presuppose a belief in God? “You can,” Jamison insists, “be grateful without believing in God.”In 1969, Knox-Johnston became the first person to make a nonstop single-handed circumnavigation of the globe when he was the only competitor in a round-the-world yacht race to make it home. He was in his late 20s, and sailing a 32ft yacht the journey took 312 days. Ten weeks into the voyage, Knox-Johnston’s radio broke down. “It was very frustrating,” he says. “I could hear people calling me, but I couldn’t respond.” For four and a half months, nothing was heard of him. The Times prepared an obituary.How did he keep himself together mentally? “That worried me,” he admits. “I took to learning poetry. I had a lovely anthology by Field Marshal Wavell called Other Men’s Flowers. I committed all these wonderful poems to memory. I’d sit there steering while reciting to myself.“I tried to keep to a regular schedule. Sleep during the night, although obviously at times you couldn’t because you had to be on deck. I’d make myself dinner, check everything was all right, then go and have some sleep, wake three or four hours later, check things, go back to bed again. Then, as the sun rose, I’d get up, have a cup of coffee, make breakfast, check the boat and take my sights to work out where I was.” Food was fairly basic, but he had taken 12 bottles of whisky, 12 of brandy and 120 cans of beer, and he enjoyed a whisky or brandy with a cigarette before dinner. Did he ever get drunk? “You’re on your own,” he says emphatically. “That would be pretty stupid.”Did he miss company? “Oh God, yes,” he says, just as emphatically. “Going past Australia with my receiver working and picking up dance music on a Saturday night. You thought: ‘What the hell am I doing out here on my own?’ But then you think: ‘I’m still in this. I’m not giving this up for anything.’” And sex? “You have to put it out of your mind,” he says. “You need all your energy for the boat.”Byrne has lived with her husband on the island of Colonsay (population 135) in the Inner Hebrides for more than 40 years, first running a hotel and now a bookshop.  It is one of the most isolated communities in the UK. For Byrne self-sufficiency is a way of life. “Other people are used to shopping every day for what they’re going to eat,” she says. “We shop for a month. It’s a completely different mindset.”There are pros and cons to island life. “There is no crime, and people look out for each other. On the other hand, people know everyone else’s business.” Does the isolation ever get her down? “No”, she says. “I am a very easy person. But for some people it’s almost impossible. That’s why we can’t sustain much of a population here. It’s heaven on a spring morning, but for weeks and months in the winter it’s really hard.”Byrne says the years-long feuds that used to characterise island life have lessened. “People have their opinions and sometimes it would make your hair curl listening to what people say, but overall we do realise we’re all in this together.” She also says the drinking culture is not what it was. “People have woken up to the fact that having at least one car in the ditch every weekend is not a good idea.”Her tips for the newly isolated? “Keep busy. Don’t slouch around. Get up in the morning, get dressed, have a plan. It’s too easy to fritter away your time, and that is very soul-destroying.” Does she ever get bored? “I don’t really,” she says. “There’s always a good book to read, especially if you own a bookshop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63544bced3730a392aad0bb0c5cf39e877f3825/0_325_5262_3157/master/5262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f07c9d07973fd1716bf0e57c2ef513bd","title":"the new rules of lockdown how to stay clean safe and two metres away from everyone","story":"Is it OK to sit and chat to your neighbour in their front garden should you disinfect your bank card regularly and do woolly gloves offer any protection?We face, among other more existential challenges, a whole new set of rules. Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another’s space suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering. Courtesy has never been more serious: it is the way we signal that we still care about each other, when we’re not allowed to hug. So here are some answers to the questions that we are increasingly asking.This social distancing thing: how should I walk down the pavement? In the middle? On the left? On the right? Or next to the street so I can get right out of people’s way?If you are on your own, you can walk down the street however you damn please just keep an eye out for people coming towards you and maintain your distance. Try not to dawdle where the pavement narrows, especially if people might be coming up behind you. If you are walking as a couple, inconvenience yourselves – walk into the gutter, separate, go round the parked car – on behalf of anyone else. If you are walking as a family, go in the bubble formation, all members round some central member. You are not going to scatter in a uniform way as someone comes towards you, but they can see you, and if you all stick together, they can react accordingly.“The protocol,” explains Dr Jane Greatorex, a virologist, microbiologist and senior tutor at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, “is that nobody can breathe the virus on you. Experiments have been done looking at that. But if you are passing too close and an inidual coughs on you, then you do stand a chance of being infected.” This is the logic behind the two-metre distance: that someone outside that distance could indeed cough, and that would be OK. “This is going to sound really stupid,” Greatorex continues, “but people have to understand how big two metres is. Getting it across to kids in particular: my local Waitrose has a cardboard cutout of Jürgen Klopp.” (For non-football fans, Klopp is 1.93m tall, or 6ft 4in.) On the other hand, if someone walks past you without observing that two-metre distance, but hasn’t coughed or sneezed, there is no need to scream abuse at them.What should I do if someone gets too close, or looks as if they are about to?Sonia Adesara is a doctor, coming out of self-isolation to join the frontline against Covid-19 this week (I put it so dramatically to indicate that it is our duty to listen to her). “I think the general etiquette if there’s someone working at the till who every two minutes has a person coming close towards their face, try to give them a bit of space, because they’re being put in that situation by their work. But if someone’s jogging past and they’re suddenly within two metres, you need to understand that it’s not life or death. Someone running past you is not going to pass on the virus. It’s more sustained contact than that.” The reason we try to keep distance on public transport is in case of droplets.Is there any point in wearing a face mask? What about a scarf over your mouth and nose?Adesara says that if you are coughing and spluttering, anything that protects other people from droplets will help, although better etiquette is to cough or sneeze into a tissue and throw it away. Greatorex underlines the distinction between a paper face mask and full PPE equipment: “The sort of face mask that they’ll be wearing on intensive care wards has to be specially fitted, in order to prevent any virus particle getting on to your face.” It is rarely necessary for people to try to find that protection outside a clinical setting, although a care worker, going house to house, might want to wear a paper mask, because they will “stop a cough going ‘whoomph’ out of your mouth” (Greatorex). Of course, if you are actively coughing, you shouldn’t be outside at all, or working. So this is really advice for a surprise first cough.Is it safe to touch shop doors? Touchscreens? Your shopping? How can I make it safer?Greatorex explains: “Virus particles have an envelope, the lipid molecule. It will bind to some things really well – soft fabrics and paper – and it will die relatively quickly on those. But on hard surfaces – glass, plastic – that it won’t bind to, it can stay alive much longer. Stainless steel is a disaster.” Try to avoid touching hard surfaces with your hands altogether, and use an elbow or a shoulder if you can. Where you cannot avoid using your hands – escalator handrails, shopping trolleys, car doors – you should first and foremost avoid touching your face, come in the house, wash your hands, then put on plastic gloves and go out and clean the hard surfaces that you will regularly touch, such as your front door.As for food packaging, you are bound to pick it up, so just wipe it when you get home, washing your hands before and after.What about deliveries? Are they safe to take into the house at once?“The outside packaging is the only thing that’s really going to be a danger to you,” Greatorex says. “Treat everything from outside with a degree of caution, because someone’s packaged it.”What is the best way to wash any food I get to make sure it’s germ-free?Greatorex says: “Factory production lines, your Tesco ready meal, that’ll be as clean as a whistle. It will all have been done in a sterile environment. Fruit and vegetables, likewise, will mostly have been sorted by machines. I’d still wash an apple in soap and water, especially if it was from a farm shop.” Wait: she would wash an apple with soap? “Well, I am a microbiologist.”You should treat all food with a degree of caution unless you have grown it yourself. If you think that is ridiculous, remember the salmonella outbreak that came from strawberries, or the infections you can get from bagged salad.Should I be regularly disinfecting my bank card, my phone etc?You should wipe your phone down with a cloth and disinfectant twice a day. If you have mostly used contactless payment, your bank cards should be OK. Most people seem to have given up using cash, not so much for the potential for infection from the cash itself – although the virus can survive better on polymer notes than on paper – but because you don’t really want to be handing things to anyone.Should I wear gloves in the supermarket – and are woolly ones at all effective if I don’t have latex gloves?Woolly gloves are worse than pointless. They trap the virus, so you still have to wash them regularly – and hands are easier to wash.I have been out to exercise once and didn’t see a single person. Does this really have to count as my one piece of exercise? Is it OK to go out again?This is all about messaging: if you went out once and saw nobody, of course you haven’t infected anyone. But people who live in built-up areas are going to find it impossible to get that level of isolation, and it will be corrosive to harmony if we say the strictest rules are only for people who live in tower blocks. What we are trying to avoid is the measures becoming any more stringent: in France and Germany, you are not allowed more than a fixed number of metres from your front door. And that will involve abiding by rules for which there seem to be scant microbiological foundation.Shopping for food or medicine, exercise, feeding animals and looking after other people who are self-isolating. Especially if they are cocooning for 12 weeks, waving at them through a window counts as essential, so long as you combine it with something else they actually need. If you are going stir-crazy, the best thing you can do is join your local volunteer group, which always has essential errands.How long should I carry on paying my childminder, cleaner etc if I cannot use them?This is not a medical question as such, but over to Adesara: “You should pay everyone you normally employ for as long as you can afford to. You have to think about what other people’s situations are: you may not be using their services, but that person also needs to feed themselves and their families.”It it OK to meet up with people who live close by if I keep two metres away?As long as you maintain your distance – Greatorex still talks to her neighbours over the fence. There is no obvious reason that you can’t use your exercise to run to your friend’s house and sit in her front garden, but within reason. If you are ceaselessly socialising, you are going to annoy everyone.Can I let my dogs and cats socialise with others? Can they pass on coronavirus?There have been reports of two dogs having caught the virus from their owners, but there is no evidence of animals being able to pass it on, so it is still OK, in a park, to let your dogs frolic so long as you do not get too close to the owners. Good luck stopping your cat from socialising.How do I tell someone they are not behaving safely?Ask yourself first whether or not you are enjoying playing the world’s police officer a little bit too much. Delivery drivers and other essential workers report having been harassed in the street for being out, when they are on their way to work. It is much easier for some people to self-isolate than it is for others, and consider before you judge someone else’s behaviour the possibility that their situation is more complicated than you appreciate. There are very few circumstances in which upbraiding someone will be more effective for your safety than simply moving a bit further away from them. Adesara is unnerved by how much the police are relishing their new powers: “One force’s social media feed was shaming someone the other day for walking her dog in high heels. But there is really nothing dangerous about walking your dog in heels.”Do I need to wash my clothes and have a shower as soon as I get in after I have been outside even if I have not touched anything?This somewhat depends what being outside entailed. Greatorex’s sister works in a supermarket, where she interacts with a large number of people, and changes into fresh clothes at the end of work, brings her uniform home in a bag and puts it straight in the washing machine (having first washed her hands). Other people in similar high-contact jobs – teachers who are still working, for instance – have been advised to keep a bin bag at their front door and their washing machine open, then strip as soon as they walk in, put all their clothes in the bag, have a shower, then wash the clothes.If you are just going out to make an essential journey, make sure you have a jumper or coat that you wear only outdoors.Do I need to wash my hands all the time and not touch my face even if I haven’t been out of the house for a week?“If you never see anybody, no. Even if there was once virus on any of your surfaces, it will die off and you’ll be surrounded by dead virus,” Greatorex reassures us.How do I stop myself eating all the lockdown snacks?People seem to go one of two ways, either eating everything they can see, or losing their appetites with anxiety. It is actually better to be eating all the snacks, because at least it will cheer you up.You could do elaborate menu plans and try to stick to three meals a day. Or you could just give yourself a break. I got so bored the other day, I taught my dog to back away from cheese. I put it on Twitter, and someone said: “That’s great – can you teach me?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001830d20a63022669482a71a43f97d0e40aa964/0_539_1831_1098/master/1831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c63aa669bc57518625bc8b9ff2b0edf8","title":"tiger king joe exotic netflix southern queerness","story":"Who could have guessed that a mullet-wearing, polyamorous exotic animal owner would become TV’s most talked-about gay star?In the early 2000s, the most popular queer characters on TV were Jack McFarland and Will Truman of the sitcom Will \u0026amp Grace. Will and Jack were so beloved, Vice-President Joe Biden once theorized the show had played a major role in shifting views on marriage equality. The characters were also the start of a trope that would prevail on TV for years: the cosmopolitan gay male. The image would live on in shows such as Queer as Folk, Looking, and the reality competitions Project Runway and America’s Next Top Model. Who could imagine that 20 years on, a mullet-wearing, gay, polyamorous exotic animal owner from rural Oklahoma would become TV’s biggest talked about gay star?Joe Exotic, the eccentric subject of the Netflix docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, has amassed a fervent following in the short time since the show’s premiere on Friday. The rapper Cardi B live-tweeted her reactions and expressed a desire to start a GoFundMe campaign for Mr Exotic, whose full name Wikipedia gives as Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (né Schreibvogel). Fans have taken to dressing up as Joe, slapping on fake handlebar mustaches and blond mullet wigs. And actors such as Dax Shepard and Jared Leto are pitching themselves to play the gun-loving zookeeper in a forthcoming scripted miniseries. Amid the anxiety of the coronavirus pandemic, we are finding humor and relief in an imperfect, self-described “redneck” queer who owns more than 200 tigers. He’s the furthest cry from the affable, anodyne queer men who typically win America over, such as Cam and Mitchell of Modern Family and the “gay best friend” cast of Queer Eye. But unlikely times call for an unlikely hero.“It’s possible people need a really flawed person to humanize right now,” says Matt Brim, professor and author of Poor Queer Studies. Brim says the love for Joe might be more complicated than it immediately appears to be. “What is the calculus here? For some viewers, Joe Exotic’s rural white queer class identity may be his flaw, so that looking past or accepting it signals tolerance, that most passive-aggressive of power plays. For other viewers, those same qualities – in their specific and unwieldy combination – may represent the very soup of our common dilemma. One thing’s for sure: we’re not in South Bend any more,” he said, referring to the city where the former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was mayor.Joe belongs to a rural, Republican-voting, working-class background, which makes for great TV for those who have a superficial understanding of the south. Joe appears to be keenly aware of this fact, playing into the shock value of his queer, southern life. Before Tiger King, he pitched multiple reality shows about his life to networks and starred in country music videos with his husbands. He is the perfect kind of reality star – straddling the line between an unrestrained “big” personality and a caricature.Joe’s queerness and southern-ness intersect in distinct, complex ways. This includes his use of meth, a popular gay recreational drug. (In 2018, Oklahoma, site of Joe’s zoo, was listed as having one of the highest rates of meth use in the US.) He goes out of his way to associate with traditional ideas of masculinity through his love for guns, collection of large, aggressive animals, and pursuit of young, butch men who have previous histories of only dating women.In the show, Joe says he fell in love with tigers while recovering from a suicide attempt he linked to his parents’ homophobia. Did Joe decide the best way to reconcile his queerness with his surroundings was to assimilate in the most extreme ways – leaning into the love for hunting and control over wildlife that dominates southern culture? Then he cultivated this assimilation and it grew into a profitable persona. Joe made it so that the most outrageous thing about him in Oklahoma was neither his queerness or poly relationships. It was his tigers.Despite his progressive lifestyle, Joe himself is not a progressive. He believes in unregulated gun rights and, during his bizarre, far-fetched run for governor of Oklahoma, positioned himself as a libertarian. A viral video shows him pondering why black people can say the N-word but white people can’t. However, his queerness complicates this otherwise predictable ideology. At his wedding, we see Joe and his two husbands dressed in fuschia western shirts – none of the elements feel coherent or like they belong together. Since its legalization in 2015, same-sex marriage no longer possesses the same air of radicalism and defiance. But a polyamorous one? Even the progressives in Brooklyn might bat a lash at that.In Tiger King, Joe presents a less than perfect view of himself – from his meth use to nasty spats with co-workers to his tragic, failed marriages to allegedly straight men. But, in many ways, Joe’s imperfections (and criminal convictions) are what make him feel like a breakthrough for queer representation. Because “perfect” is so 1998.However, there is the danger we are collectively laughing at Joe and his rural background, instead of laughing with him.Representation of queerness in red states has always been sparse and complicated. The portrayals often face accusations of being exploitative or overly simplistic. A recent one was John B McLemore of the hit podcast series S-Town. McLemore was a queer horologist living in Woodstock, Alabama, a small, conservative place he hated. Critics called the podcast “voyeuristic” and irresponsible for outing McLemore after his death. Netflix’s Queer Eye occasionally chooses LGBTQ+ subjects living in conservative locales for its transformations, and the show’s format – “fix all your problems in an hour” with a group of affluent, pro-consumption coastal gay men – has drawn scrutiny.Does the novelty of a complicated figure such as Joe Exotic expose our preferences for coastal queer narratives? “Yes,” says John Howard, professor and author of Men Like That: A Southern Queer History. “For 25 years, scholars have criticized a bicoastal bias in US queer history that has focused attention on east and west coast metropolitan areas. But this is changing.” Howard points to the conversations Tiger King is producing. “Let’s hope the public debate expands. Perhaps we’ll learn more about working-class queers and trans people of color who, as yet, remain at the margins of Joe’s narrative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab0e25b4f4cd662b657a6c5fb10817a999dbdfa8/1677_94_846_508/master/846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70f64393e77cebf616db19f6a999c992","title":"pop singer cristina coronavirus us","story":"The pop performer, who was known for being a part of the 80s underground New York scene, was 61• ‘It was like a fairytale’: the extraordinary story of Ze RecordsThe new-wave pop singer Cristina has reportedly died at age 61 after being diagnosed with coronavirus.The singer, whose full name was Cristina Monet-Zilkha, is believed to have died of complications from Covid-19, according to reports from various music channels and those close to the musician. Fans flooded the singer’s Instagram account with comments, expressing their grief.Cristina is known for dance-pop tunes such as Things Fall Apart, Disco Clone and a cover of Peggy Lee’s Is That All There Is? that were emblematic of the 1980s underground New York scene.She enjoyed brief success through club hits co-written with her husband, Ze Records label owner Michael Zilkha, before the two retired from music and moved to Texas in 1985. After her orce in 1990, she returned to New York and wrote a number of music essays.In a Facebook post, Steve Wasserman, a UC Berkeley professor and friend of the late singer, said Cristina posted to social media that she was experiencing a high fever, but “her lungs were clear” and she appeared to be recovering. “Then, with appalling swiftness, she was gone this morning,” Wasserman wrote.Singer Zola Jesus paid tribute on Twitter, calling her a “HUGE inspiration” and praising her for being “too weird for the pop world and too pop for the weird world”.Notable names in music who have died from the virus include singer Alan Merrill, the songwriter behind I Love Rock’n’Roll, and country musician Joe Diffie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ee1c2bc0787f87636cf193387dab43124022f02/87_250_5965_3582/master/5965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=559bb5c656298f728662c42316d4d088","title":"from houseparty to zoom our digital lives in lockdown","story":"The lockdown across the world has led people to desperately seek out new tools for maintaining their work and social lives online.

Just.In a parallel universe Chris Grayling could have spent his birthday – yup, Failing Grayling’s birthday really is April Fools’ Day – to be the government’s frontman at the Downing Street daily coronavirus briefing. Just imagine Grayling’s excitement at awarding a ventilator contract to a company that has no prospect of ever making a ventilator.Still, that’s not much worse than the reality of the government having done sod all during January and February when it could have awarded contracts to companies that actually do make ventilators.Back in No 10, there must be an inquest going on into whose bright idea it was to have a daily coronavirus press conference. What must have seemed like a show of strength and leadership when Boris Johnson and Classic Dom came up with the plan a week or so ago, now merely exposes the government’s lack of preparations and complete cluelessness every 24 hours. What’s more, almost everyone in government knows it’s a disaster. Which is why most cabinet ministers switch their phones off for several hours every morning: because they don’t want to be the mug who winds up having to front the 45-minute embarrassment live on TV at 5pm. So today’s press conference was fronted by Alok Sharma, who not even everyone in the cabinet knows is the current business secretary. Though he is a huge improvement on both Dominic “Psycho” Raab and Michael Gove, simply because he doesn’t have any of their associated instability and lack of trust issues. Put simply, Sharma is a man in whom the public can have complete confidence. The downside is that the confidence they have is that he can be guaranteed to know next to nothing about anything.After stating the latest alarming death figures, Sharma lapsed into a whole range of generalities and platitudes. It’s come to something when even Donald Trump can see that the original “herd immunity” plan had been a disaster waiting to happen. Imagine being out-thought by the US Sun Bed God. Sharma then handed over to Yvonne Doyle, the director of Public Health England, who raced through her four slides at breakneck speed. Largely because they were all so thoroughly depressing. Believe it or not, that was actually the high point. The summit of gravitas and disinformation. Because from there on it was downhill all the way. Often these video press conferences can become atavistic with journalists asking a range of different questions that can easily be ignored. Either by merely answering the easiest question or one they wish had been asked. But now the lobby hunted as a pack, repeatedly pressing both Sharma and Doyle on the question of medical provision and testing.And Sharma and Doyle had nothing. Not even blanks to fire. Sharma kept trying to palm off the difficult questions on to Doyle, who then did her best to refer them back to the business secretary. The medical is now political and the political is medical and neither side wants to take the blame.To really regain the public’s trust, someone in government has to admit it basically did nothing for several months as it totally underestimated the crisis and was more interested in Boris’s sixth or seventh baby. But no one is prepared to do that so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.Why had Michael Gove insisted that thousands of ventilators were on their way next week when the actual figure is 30? Both Sharma and Doyle shrugged. Why were the Germans so far ahead of us on testing? Were we really so Little England that we thought we could learn nothing from Jerry? How come we only had tested 2,000 NHS staff out of about 1 million frontline workers? Again Sharma and Doyle just looked a little sheepish. Above their pay grades.“Have you got anything more than warm words and good intentions?” one reporter asked. Sharma nodded earnestly. His words were going to get a lot, lot warmer – red-hot, even – and his intentions were going to be the best ever. You ain’t seen nothing yet. B-b-baby. You ain’t seen nothing yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/899610ddc4b3952f81f806e0327e9e8c64f46b04/176_219_3279_1967/master/3279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f684e53b461e8050be2a4ce9d62b06f","title":"uk set up virtual parliament during coronavirus shutdown","story":"Speaker had requested move to allow MPs to scrutinise government’s response to crisisThe government is to set up a virtual parliament to allow MPs to scrutinise its response to the coronavirus crisis following demands from the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and opposition parties.The move was announced on Wednesday night amid mounting concerns that the government has failed to get a grip on the crisis, with claims that health workers’ lives are at risk because of a lack of protective equipment and a shortage of tests for the virus.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, announced the move in a statement that said the government and parliament hoped appropriate technology would be in place by 21 April, when MPs are due to return to Westminster.He said: “Parliament’s role of scrutinising government, authorising spending and making laws must be fulfilled and in these unprecedented times that means considering every technological solution available. We are exploring options with the parliamentary authorities in readiness for parliament’s return.”It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties.In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as:Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 31 March, more than 780,000 people have been infected in more than 170 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 37,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 11,500 fatalities, and there have been over 7,700 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 164,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 166,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.A source said the plan would be in place by the end of the month. There have been calls from across the political spectrum for MPs to be allowed to scrutinise the government remotely at a time of enormous social upheaval and as freedom of movement is being curtailed by new laws to encourage physical distancing and self-isolation.The government came under pressure to set up a virtual parliament after an unusual intervention by Hoyle on Wednesday. In a letter to Rees-Mogg, the Speaker said MPs should still be able to take part in prime minister’s questions, and put questions to government departments and ministers even if they could not return to Westminster as scheduled on 21 April.Hoyle argued that a trial of virtual select committee hearings had already been successful and he had asked officials to investigate how they would apply similar technology for use in the Commons chamber.Hoyle wrote: “Once the house returns, if we are still in the grip of the crisis where the physical presence of members, or too many members, in the palace is not appropriate, I am keen that they should be able to participate in key parliamentary proceedings virtually, for example oral questions, urgent questions, statements.“The House Service has already trialled some virtual select committee evidence sessions with witnesses, and I have asked officials to investigate how they would apply similar technology to the types of business listed above.”The Speaker also asked if it would be possible for the government to set up a forum of MPs during the recess, possibly via select committee chairs, who could quiz senior government representatives at set times on different days.“MPs are being swamped right now with questions and casework from distressed constituents who need answers,” he said. “Responses cannot wait for the house to sit again.”A hundred MPs from Labour, the Scottish National party and the Green party wrote a letter last week to the Commons clerk, John Benger, asking for his support in setting up a form of digital parliament.Parliament broke for recess a week early as the number of cases of Covid-19 around Westminster increased. MPs are due back on 21 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b03936c704f542a8b789a79899e9d679c2821c51/0_250_3784_2270/master/3784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e4e4052b41a962ad18844abd1787bd6","title":"950000 apply for universal credit in two weeks of uk lockdown","story":"The government has moved 10,000 staff to process claims and is recruiting moreNearly a million people have successfully applied for universal credit in the last fortnight, in a rush to welfare support that reveals the depth of the jobs crisis caused by the UK’s lockdown.Applications started flooding in as soon as Boris Johnson told the nation to stop non-essential contact with others and cease all unnecessary travel.The surge reflects falls in income as well as unemployment as firms go bust or lay off staff because they cannot afford to wait for the Treasury’s retention scheme to start making payments.“We have never seen anything like this,” said Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank. “It is not remotely normal even in the grim circumstances of a recession. While attention has understandably focused on new retention and self-employment schemes, universal credit delivering in the face of this huge jobs shock is the key to many families avoiding real hardship.”Bell said: “The scale of the claims means we should add hardworking civil servants from the Department for Work and Pensions to our ever-growing list of people to be grateful for. Their job in processing these claims and getting cash to families couldn’t be more crucial.”The DWP said it had moved more than 10,000 staff to deal with claims and was recruiting more.Labour called the figures “truly shocking” and urged the government to make the process more efficient.“The government must wake up and take action, not leave people waiting days to verify their identity and five weeks to get the support they need. Advances are not the answer to the five-week wait, they are loans that have to be paid back, and nobody knows how long this crisis will last.“The government should turn advances into non-repayable grants to end the five-week wait and make sure people get the support they need quickly at a level that genuinely protects them from poverty.”A DWP spokesperson said: “With such a huge increase in claims, there are pressures on our services. But the system is standing up well to these and our dedicated staff are working flat out to get people the support they need.

That night it started to fall.“To my surprise, it did not come back,” she recalls of the fever. “My body finally began to fight it off and the next day they told me I could go home the day after if everything stayed stable.“I was so relieved. I had kept thinking I should’ve been admitted earlier and feared it was too late. It was the most terrifying experience of my life.”More than 29,000 people across the UK are confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, and it is thought that thousands more have it. The disease has killed 2,352 people in the UK so far.Meanwhile, 174,019 people globally are known to have recovered. The number in the UK remains unclear, but heartening reports are beginning to emerge.“I actually got out of bed today, which is huge,” says 51-year-old Lou, in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire. “I thought I was dying Wednesday last week, when I couldn’t take a breath and was losing consciousness.”Paramedics who came to Lou’s house found that her temperature exceeded 104F and her blood pressure and oxygen intake had dropped. She was rushed to hospital along with her husband, who was also symptomatic. She was tested for Covid-19 on Friday and is still awaiting her results.In hospital she was put on a drip and given a variety of drugs, and her condition stabilised. She was discharged several days later as the choking feeling began to ease and her fever subsided.“It makes you think: sod bloody work. When this is over, we are having fun,” she says. “It’s baby steps, but we are slowly getting there.”Only patients with the worst symptoms are being admitted to hospital, and 22-year-old Ryan is among many whom 111 call handlers have told to stay at home and self-isolate unless they have severe difficulties breathing.“I’m very relieved I recovered,” says Ryan, a third-year engineering student at Imperial College London, telling of coughing red phlegm, exhaustion, night sweats and nausea. “I couldn’t get out of bed when the fever was at its worst.

Jenny, 59, a former GP in Falkirk who has multiple sclerosis, isolated herself from her vulnerable family and has since been able to resume normal life.Although she is still quite fatigued and has to stop to catch her breath while walking through her village, she has now returned to caring for her partner, who is undergoing chemotherapy, and her father, who has dementia.Jenny stresses her desire to give people optimism about recovery and the importance of isolating if you have symptoms. “Every single one of us can make a difference in the flattening of the epidemic curve,” she says.For Ati, the episode has given her a new sense of community.“We started to see messages from neighbours, my GP and friends offering help,” she says. “It was so comforting to see how society comes together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c80e0af27251214a711ed9ee2792fc3ff9a54e01/0_139_4159_2496/master/4159.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab58157cde22ba18fbdd3d1896573c35","title":"uk coronavirus testing what ministers said and what stands scrutiny","story":"Science editor Ian Sample puts advisers’ and MPs’ claims to the reality testOver the past fortnight, ministers and their scientific advisers have made a series of claims over testing. Which of them stand up to scrutiny?Reality: Amid criticism that the UK was lagging badly behind other countries, Boris Johnson declared in March that coronavirus testing would increase to 25,000  tests a day, with NHS frontline staff being among the first to benefit.At the start of April, testing was well short of the interim goal of 10,000 tests a day, with only 2,000 of about half a million NHS frontline workers having been tested. As a result, scores of NHS staff have been self-isolating without knowing if it was safe for them to return to work.

According to the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, companies are working flat out to boost their supply but are having to prioritise where the mixtures are sent.The reagents needed are specific, and different ones are required for different PCR machines – the equipment used to test for the virus by detecting its genetic material. Smaller companies are being consulted about other virus testing strategies. A better pandemic preparedness plan might have foreseen the surge in demand for testing materials and arranged to act swiftly, critics say.To add to the confusion, the Chemical Industries Association, which represents the UK’s very substantial chemicals industry, told ITV News on Tuesday that it had contacted its members who said there was no shortage of the relevant reagents.Reality: The government has bought millions of home test kits that can show if someone has had the virus and so, hopefully, developed some immunity. But no one has been able to say when the kits will be in circulation.At the end of March, Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at Public Health England, told MPs on the science and technology committee that the finger-prick tests would be evaluated within the week, and that mass testing could start days after.The government later backtracked, saying it would be some time before the tests were available and that blood samples would need to be posted to a laboratory for analysis. The tests look for antibodies to the virus, not the virus itself, so cannot pick up new infections. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200327-52465-Covid-19_+how_do_we_test_for_it.mp3 Reality: Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said it was crucial for coronavirus tests to be evaluated carefully because “one thing worse than no test is a bad test”. The reason is simple: a bad test could give an infected doctor the all-clear, sending them back into hospital to spread the virus to colleagues and patients.But some scientists argue that in the crisis the NHS needs to be more creative and relax its normally stringent rules. NHS test protocols demand specific equipment, enzymes and other chemicals, because these are known to produce reliable test results. But with those chemicals and other items in short supply, alternatives can be used to get around the bottleneck and get tests out more quickly.These tests will not be the gold standard the NHS prefers, but with proper evaluation, scientists believe they would be as good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbfde8dfc6100b17b163ecab0cfe9c1cd4ac2344/0_196_6048_3631/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ba70b2a12c8a122d4cf93a5bcfd326","title":"coronavirus and volunteering how can i help in the uk","story":"From lending a hand to local charities to bolstering the efforts of the NHS, there are many ways to get involvedThere are plenty of ways to get involved. Many local charities will be keen to attract new volunteers – especially as older stalwarts are forced to stay at home. Or there are national schemes, such as NHS volunteer responders. Some bigger charities, such as the Trussell Trust food bank network, have set up their own online schemes to match volunteers with food banks in their area. Local volunteer centres and organisations such as Volunteering Matters and Do-it can link you up with charities close to where you live. Reach Volunteering will match people with specialist professional skills, such IT expertise, to charities who need their help.The health service in England has put out a call for volunteer responders to help medical staff with tasks such as: delivering medicines from pharmacies driving patients to appointments bringing them home from hospital and making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home. More than 500,000 people have already signed up. More details are on the NHS England website.Keeping an eye out for neighbours and family members is the simplest way to help people who are vulnerable, lonely, self-isolating or busy key workers. Help could mean anything from running errands to the shops to providing a friendly voice of reassurance and support. Covid-19 Mutual Aid was set up to co-ordinate “good neighbour” initiatives and has lists of local groups in your area, together with details of how to help people safely.Yes. According to Shaun Delaney of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, exceptions to the guidance include people needing to travel to provide care to others. “In other words, people can go out to volunteer if they are providing help to vulnerable people or if their volunteering cannot be done from home.” If you are deemed high risk – you are aged over 70 or have underlying health issues – there are volunteering opportunities that you can do by phone or computer from home.Be sensible and vigilant. If you are helping out neighbours, please remember physical distancing rules: try to communicate by phone or text don’t enter people’s houses and always stay at least two metres away. Look after yourself, don’t go on an errand for a neighbour if you are ill or self-isolating. Wash your hands regularly.There are inescapable health risks from face-to-face volunteering and no guarantees that you will have adequate personal protective equipment. For this reason many voluntary projects, such as community kitchens and day centres, have shut down services. However, others are adapting to try to minimise the risks of infection through physical contact or close proximity. Some face-to-face befriending services, for example, have been replaced by phone or online alternatives.Yes. Charities both small and large have been devastated by the sudden drop in voluntary income caused by the cancellation or postponement of fundraising gatherings, ranging from fetes and coffee mornings to the London marathon. Those with high street retail outlets have also been hit by shop closures. UK charities estimate they will lose over £4bn over the next few weeks. Without cash, thousands of charities, including hospices, health and social care, and cancer support charities will be forced to reduce services, or in some cases even close down.The immediate focus is on charities that can provide emergency frontline support to vulnerable people affected by the social impact of coronavirus, including food banks and care organisations helping older, isolated and disabled people and their families. There are more than 14 million people living on the breadline in the UK, and they will be badly hit by the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Other organisations that need help include those providing welfare advice and emotional and respite support.One of the safest ways of giving is to donate to the National Emergencies Trust. This charity is co-ordinating the UK coronavirus disaster voluntary relief effort, providing a single online portal for donations from iniduals and companies. The money will be rapidly distributed in the form of small grants to recognised local charities via 46 established regional community foundations covering the whole of the UK.

Choose yours wisely, says sleep expert Dr Rangan Chatterjee Do you wake up with an aching back? With pain in your neck? Or an acute need for high-strength coffee? How you feel the second your alarm goes off tells you legions about how well you slept. And the underlying cause of your sleep issues could be literally lying under you: your mattress is the foundation to a good night’s rest.“One of the big problems with sleep is that we underestimate the importance of getting eight quality hours,” says Dr Rangan Chatterjee, M\u0026ampS sleep ambassador and author of The Stress Solution. “Once you prioritise your sleep, it automatically improves.” Sleep is fundamental to how we feel in the day. If you look in the brain after a bad night’s sleep, says Chatterjee, “you see a collapse in memory, attention, cognitive function, decision-making capacity and the ability to learn new things.” And an increased likelihood of exploding when there’s an unexpected item in the bagging area at the supermarket, because a bad night’s sleep is synonymous with a bad mood.Admittedly, we all have a few big nights out and accidental midnight Netflix binges, but sometimes we’re unable to sleep well through the night at no fault of our own. And a common culprit? That old mattress you’ve been making do with. “When your mattress is so comfortable that you can’t wait to get into bed in the evening, you send a powerful message to your body and brain,” says Chatterjee. Think of finding the right mattress as an act of self-care, up there with going to yoga or cooking a healthy dinner.Waking up covered in sweat isn’t necessarily a symptom of nightmares. The answer is more practical than that, says Chatterjee: “Being physically hot at night will wake you up. Being cool is critical to good sleep, so keep your bedroom at a cool, well-ventilated 17C.” If keeping the window open isn’t an option, or you’re still overheating, treat yourself to a cooling mattress topper or a luxury mattress with thermoregulating properties.If you often wake up feeling stiff, a memory foam mattress can feel like a miracle. The material is also supportive if you’re tossing and turning, or you have joint problems. “For some people, memory foam can be absolutely life-changing,” says Chatterjee. “The material adapts to your weight and body shape, so it’s very personalised.” As your body sinks into the mattress, you may even feel your spine start to stretch out. It’s the restorative antidote to hunching over a desk during the day.So how do you know you’ve found the right mattress? Simple, says Chatterjee: “When you lie down and you don’t want to get up.” Sweet dreams.The natural option: Made using cashmere, silk, pashmina, lambswool and cotton, the Natural Plus 1500 Medium mattress (from £499) is a pocket spring mattress with an enhanced natural and supportive feel.The M\u0026ampS Sleep Shop has everything you need for a great night’s sleep.

The secret to a good night lies in your evening routine, says  Alexandra Jones“We all have our own unique relationship with sleep, but two things are true for all of us: to sleep soundly we need to feel safe and settled in our environment,” says sleep therapist Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Fast Asleep, Wide Awake. The solution is multi-sensory. “Creating a pre-bedtime ritual, incorporating visual, physical or olfactory cues can be a good way to foster those feelings,” she says. “So my most important tip is to find a routine that helps you to drift off and to stick to it.”And it’s not just about the 20 minutes before bedtime. “From the moment you step through the door in the evening, start making the transition from the busyness of the day to a relaxed state that’s ready for sleep,” says Ramlakhan. “There are a few small tricks that can be incorporated into anyone’s evening, no matter how busy.”But where do you start? “Lighting is paramount,” says Ramlakhan. The hormone melatonin is responsible for making us fall asleep the pineal gland in our brain naturally starts to release more melatonin into the bloodstream at night. However, bright lights, especially screen light, can delay the production of melatonin by stimulating a nerve pathway connecting the retina in the eye to an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. “Candles are a good option if you don’t want to delay the onset of melatonin release,” says Ramlakhan. She recommends two hours of low light, giving the brain plenty of time to start pumping the sleep hormone into the system. Opt for the Calm Candle, £7.50, which releases a gentle fragrance mix of clary sage, lavender and sweet orange – formulated to promote relaxation.In fact, lavender has long been used as a natural sedative as far back as the 14th century, Charles VI, king of France, is said to have demanded that lavender be stuffed into his pillows to help him sleep.“My own bedroom is scented with lavender,” says Ramlakhan. Over the past 10 years, several studies have found that, neurologically, the smell of lavender oil has anti-anxiety and analgesic properties. “The scientific benefits of aromatherapy interventions are still being understood, but incorporating them into our night-time routine can make us feel calm from the associations we have with the smell.” As well as lavender, Ramlakhan uses eucalyptus because, as she explains: “It was used in my childhood a lot – and that memory makes it a potent relaxant for me. Adding something with a strong aromatherapeutic smell into your night-time routine can act like a trigger, telling your brain that it’s time for sleep.”When you’re sleeping away from home, bring your bedtime routine with you to reduce the unsettling feeling. So, if lavender is part of your night-time ritual, says Ramlakhan, “the associated behaviour and smell is likely to help you relax and create feelings of safety.” Ren Pillow Spray, £19, is blended with essential oils, including lavender.Alternatively, switching your regular shower gel to something like L’Occitane Aromachologie Relaxing Shower Gel, £16.50, could work just as well. It has a blend of essential oils that infuse the steam with a relaxing scent. “And if you’ve got time for a bath in the evening, salts are a great way to relax tired muscles,” says Ramlakhan. As well as washing away tension, This Works Deep Sleep Bath Soak, £22, smells ine and will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated.The trick is not to leave showering or bathing too late. Like light, body temperature plays an important role in preparation for the night the process of rapid cooling after a hot shower is proven to aid sleep, but it takes about 90 minutes to reach peak drowsiness.

The government talks about abolishing the licence fee. Certain newspapers compete to haul the programme makers over the coals for various crimes, from “woke” casting to “mucking around” with classics. There are rumours of declining ratings and mutterings about the muscle of Netflix and Amazon. Add to that a pandemic that has forced some of the corporation’s biggest dramas – including Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders – to cease production and it would be no surprise to find Piers Wenger in a pessimistic mood. In fact, the opposite is true.“It’s been a really mad time,” says the head of BBC drama. “But it’s also been inspiring in terms of the ingenuity creators, producers and casts are showing to get their shows on screen.” He’s been holding “daily calls to talk about the longer term impact this crisis will have on the kind of story audiences are most in need of”.There have been talks, too, about how to protect the BBC’s huge swath of freelance talent. “I’ve spent the day talking about how the BBC will support small and medium-sized production companies who will find the closedown particularly challenging – and how we work with established industry bodies to support freelancers, through a hardship fund or some other means. It’s something we’re taking seriously because, yes, people expect the BBC to do the right thing – and quite rightly, given the way we’re funded.”Wenger is clearly pleased with the swiftness of the corporation’s wider response to the pandemic, from the extended news coverage to an array of educational, health and cultural programming, not to mention the decision to bring back old favourites such as Spooks to iPlayer. “We need to shape the output – whether you’re school age, seeking escape, looking for drama at 9pm, or want a comedy that really makes you laugh and reflects the soul of the nation, like This Country.”That said, it’s clear the past few days have brought a sea change. When we first talked, pre-lockdown, Wenger stressed the importance of “drama for me”, as he called it. “Not me personally, but rather for particular demographics instead of a broad mainstream.” This is theme close to the 47-year-old’s heart. Since leaving Channel 4 as head of drama in 2016, he has worked hard to overhaul how the BBC commissions drama, shifting from the general to the specific, to fulfil “bespoke” viewer needs.“If you look at work we’ve got coming up this year and compare it with what might have been commissioned for BBC One five or 10 years ago, you would see how we are making drama for a very erse range,” he said pre-virus. “We would never underestimate the power of communal viewing, but we have to be flexible in the terms of the way we platform our drama. I feel that our current slate is serving the whole population rather than just super-serving the heartlands.”Speaking now, he admits to a different focus. “It’s very interesting to see the extent to which audiences are coming together to enjoy shows that have a really strong universal appeal. Whether it’s The Repair Shop or Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, I think people are taking great comfort from watching together, and knowing they are watching along with the rest of the nation – whereas up to now, the general trend was to seek out stories that were more bespoke. Audiences will continue to want those very particular pieces, but this period will also be a reminder of the sense of community that television can bring to the nation.”So he’s particularly pleased about two upcoming adaptations: David Nicholls’ take on his bestselling marriage-in-crisis novel Us, starring Tom Hollander, Saskia Reeves and Sofie Gråbøl and Normal People, which tackles Sally Rooney’s much-admired young-and-in-love second novel. “Us might not be a super-tanker of a show, but it has a lot of heart and a lot to say about family. While Normal People is both a thrilling ride and incredibly emotionally honest. I think audiences will enjoy losing themselves in the lives of its protagonists.”Not that he’s back-pedalling his support of the year’s most innovative dramas, including the sleek period crime thriller The Serpent Michaela Coel’s provocative contemporary drama January 22nd and Small Axe, Steve McQueen’s anthology series about black British history. Interestingly, all will air on BBC One.“Why should a voice like Michaela’s be confined to the margins?” Wenger says. “Stories like this and Small Axe haven’t been given the big platform they deserve. We’re looking to give the mainstream audience as much stimulation as we can. It makes sense to embrace the most erse range of storytellers that we can. Having Michaela and Steve on BBC One in the same year is massive for the BBC.”Is he concerned that the lockdown might lead to delays? “We’re in the very early stages,” he says. “With Small Axe, Steve has finished shooting and has been editing each episode. We are currently on course, although much will depend on how long the lockdown lasts. Steve has been incredibly pragmatic but there are also obviously things he’s going to be incredibly rigorous about. So it’s hard to say for sure, although the signs are positive.”He is, however, prepared for a backlash when the shows do air. The recent adaptation of Malorie Blackman’s best-selling young adult novel Noughts + Crosses, about a world where black people rule over white people, was called a “recipe for ision” in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, the casting of Vinette Robinson, who is black, as Mary Cratchit in A Christmas Carol led to predictable complaints.“Oh, the whole woke thing,” says Wenger laughing. “For us not to choose Vinette Robinson, who was the best actress put up for that part, is like saying there weren’t any black people in London in the 19th century, which is just historically inaccurate among other things.”While the pandemic has put talk of cuts and threats to the licence fee on hold, are there still concerns? “Of course. None of us can ignore the discourse around the BBC. For me, conversations about decriminalisation of licence fee non-payment and a subscription model for the BBC just point back in the direction of the importance of being a universal service.“We serve the heartland, but you have to think about young audiences and erse audiences and audiences across the whole nation to justify the licence fee. Quite often when I’m thinking about what to commission, I think who are the hardest people to convince? Which are the toughest nuts to crack? How can I give them a show that will be irresistible to them?”Small Axe, a little-told history that speaks to an audience Wenger feels has been ignored, is crucial in this regard. The first episode of McQueen’s anthology series focuses on the Mangrove Nine, a group of black activists who were tried in 1970 for inciting a riot they had been protesting against police targeting the Mangrove Restaurant in Notting Hill, London, a gathering place for intellectuals and activists. “It gave me the same visceral thrill as Hunger. It’s a defining piece of work from Steve McQueen, told with such purpose and drive and anger that you are stopped in your tracks.”He hopes it will address the ongoing exodus of black British actors to America. “The more work like Small Axe, the more work like January 22nd, the more work like Noughts + Crosses, the more we send a positive message that they don’t have to go. Clearly this has been an awfully long time coming. We’ve got to sustain that supply line of work for a bond of trust to build up, so we hang on to that talent.”This does not mean ignoring the BBC’s other shows, though. There will still be room for Line of Duty to get viewers across the country wound up, as well as such quietly beautiful family dramas as The A Word and Last Tango in Halifax, not to mention state of the nation shockers such as Years and Years, and epics such as World on Fire.What about a show about a global pandemic? There’s ahuge laugh. “Well, never say never – though I have to say, a pandemic drama is not what I’d want to watch when I turn on the TV this evening by any means. But if Russell T Davies phoned me tomorrow and had a completely brilliant genre-busting idea for one, I’d find him very hard to turn down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b070e58bb09c99c83cb8e1827aafe3fdecb51885/0_151_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d766822efd78d1b5d391dcf2754fdc","title":"absolutely wrong how uk coronavirus test strategy unravelled","story":"Ministers shrugged off warnings a lack of tests could cost lives, until they were forced to change tackOn 11 March, the day before Boris Johnson told the nation that the coronavirus sweeping the UK could no longer be contained and that testing for Covid-19 would stop except for the seriously ill in hospital, the head of No 10’s “nudge unit” gave a brief interview to the BBC.At the time it was barely noticed – it was budget day, after all. With hindsight, it seems astonishing. “There’s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don’t catch the disease,” said Dr David Halpern. “By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.”It was a window into the thinking of the political strategists directing the UK response to Covid-19, who claimed to base what they were doing on scientific evidence. We would let the disease spread among the healthy. So no need to test.If there was a moment when the UK turned its back on the traditional public health approach to fighting an epidemic, this was it.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.Ebola, Sars, Mers – in previous epidemics, nobody had questioned the need to hunt down and eliminate the virus by testing everyone with symptoms, tracking their contacts and isolating and testing those people in turn. But not this time.“You can’t fight a fire blindfold,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, just five days after the UK switched course in what sounded like an urgent appeal to Johnson, Halpern and any fellow travellers.“You can’t stop this pandemic if you don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every suspected case. If they test positive, isolate them and find out who they have been in close contact with up to two days before they developed symptoms and test those people too.”But his warnings were shrugged off by government ministers in the UK – public health experts had been sidelined and a newer breed of scientist was in favour at No 10.According to Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, the dominant voices in the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the scientific expert group advising the government, were mathematical modellers and behavioural scientists, including Halpern. On 25 March, Horton told MPs on the science and technology select committee that Sage appeared to have little input from public health experts and doctors, despite being chaired by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance. The clue for Horton was in the main papers it considered in advising the government of the strategy. “There is evidence on modelling and on behavioural science, but I don’t see the evidence from the public health community or from the clinical community,” he explained. Testing, isolation and quarantine – basic public health interventions – were barely on the agenda. Warnings from Chinese scientists of the severity of Covid-19 had not been understood.Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the WHO, also fiercely criticised the decision to stop tests. “For me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy,” he said. “The basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling.”Less than two weeks on from the lockdown that Johnson announced on 23 March, the original strategy, the decisions that came before and after it, and the UK’s inability to ramp up testing for NHS staff – let alone anyone else – are under unrelenting scrutiny.Ministers have been flailing. What has emerged is a picture of confusion and uncertainty at the top, with ministers making promises they cannot keep and apparently with little comprehension of the global tussle for tests that may make it impossible for the UK to buy its way belatedly out of the problem. The UK is now competing with every other nation to obtain the kits it needs, particularly the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which tells someone whether they have Covid-19 or not.  has been told that presidents and prime ministers are trying to outbid each other to secure these kits and their components, which are in short supply. The US also has woken up to the need to test – and is telling companies that export them that America must come first.No wonder, perhaps, the UK now finds itself struggling to increase testing to 25,000 a day for hospital patients and health workers, let alone meet its ambition – once stated but now seldom mentioned – to reach 100,000 a day, to include other key workers. “In all countries we have prime ministers calling the CEOs and diagnostic companies to try to get hold of the stocks. Indonesia and Peru we know have offered to order several million tests and send private planes to pick the tests up. There is more going on behind the scenes to secure supplies,” said Dr Catharina Boehme, chief executive of the non-profit Geneva-based Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, which is a WHO collaborating centre.The companies are trying to be responsible, she said. “They supply small quantities to each country to give sufficient supplies for a number of days and then ship on a very frequent basis. But there is clearly this move in the US where several companies have openly declared they can’t supply anyone outside the US.”Three US companies making the PCR tests, Abbott, Hologic and Cepheid, have been told not to export them, leaving Africa – which uses their technology in HIV tests – with a single supplier, Roche in Switzerland.The WHO, Unicef and the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation are working on procuring tests for low- and middle-income countries. There are global shortages even of the swabs, which are made by companies in just two countries, the US and Italy. In the UK, the testing regime has also been hampered by the lack of laboratory capacity to analyse the samples – a warehouse in Milton Keynes has been set up with the laboratory facilities to add capacity.In the long term, hopes are pinned on blood tests for antibodies produced by the immune system fighting the infection, which will show who has had Covid-19 and is probably therefore immune. These could be a game-changer, allowing key workers out of isolation, for instance to reopen schools.But another sign of the disconnect between public health experts and Downing Street became evident last Wednesday. Prof Sharon Peacock, director of infections at Public Health England, told MPs that millions of home testing kits would be available, delivered by Amazon or bought in Boots, within days, not weeks.“Tests are being ordered across Europe and elsewhere and purchased in south-east Asia. This is widespread practice. We are not alone in doing this,” she said.But within hours, Whitty seemed to quash the idea. He warned that antibody tests needed proper evaluation, which was being undertaken at Oxford University. “The key thing for us to do is evaluate. Are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public?” he said at the prime minister’s press conference the same day. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government had bought 3.5m antibody tests, but the  understands the UK has actually put in orders for 40m more. It is the sort of drastic gamble that governments around the world are taking, afraid that stocks will disappear.Antibody tests are being used widely in China and South Korea, where the virus has already been beaten down to lower levels by the traditional PCR testing of those with symptoms and tracing and isolating their contacts.Mass contact tracing, which can be highly labour-intensive, is made possible through phone apps, which alert people who have been near someone who has tested positive.The concept was greeted with horror by some in the UK as mass data gathering and an invasion of privacy – yet Oxford University is now developing just such an app.Looking ahead to the endgame, testing and tracing contacts, figuring out where the virus has been and who is still vulnerable is widely acknowledged among scientists to be the way to stamp out the last pockets of a pandemic.For now, Italy is doing more testing than any other country, desperate to bring down its cases and fatality rates.Not far behind is Germany, which has been doing widespread testing of suspects with symptoms and contact tracing in the WHO-recommended fashion from the beginning. Its efforts are being led by the renowned public health body, the Robert Koch Institute.And while they are the first to say the pandemic is in its early stages and could yet explode in Germany, the rise in cases and deaths has not been not as sharp as in the UK and nowhere near the levels seen in Italy and Spain.It remains to be seen whether the new UK attention to testing can help bring the numbers down here as well. In a few short weeks, a strategy that rejected old science for new seems to have unravelled – and testing has suddenly become central to the fight against Covid-19.Testing is being carried out in hospitals, new and old, and in places such as the huge vacant car park of Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey, where every ride stands still. Under temporary canvas roofs, nurses in wind-blown plastic aprons, gloves and masks lean into open car windows to swab the nose and back of the mouth of healthcare workers, who may have the telltale dry cough, or are isolating because their child or partner has."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48bc86671256e9365b3d7619597cd77c9752d957/3_0_5901_3543/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80a88789635cab9d660f34cd0446ec89","title":"a listers natalie portman lend talents to bedtime story instagram live initiative during covid lockdown","story":"Natalie Portman and Lupita Nyong’o among those signed up to Instagram Live initiative to raise money for charityAs culture adapts to the limitations imposed by the Covid-19 outbreak there has been myriad new material online, from viral pop parody videos and impromptu classical concerts to TikTok dance-offs and marathon DJ sets. But now the online cultural arms race has shifted to another, less likely target: the humble bedtime story.Several Hollywood actors, music stars and politicians have become children’s storytellers in an effort to support charities and bring some levity during the Covid-19 outbreak, as experts extol the importance of regular routines for parents and children.Natalie Portman, Lupita Nyong’o and Reese Witherspoon have all signed up to an Instagram Live initiative started by fellow actors Amy Adams and Jennifer Garner called Save With Stories, where celebrities read bedtime stories and appeal for donations to Save the Children and No Kid Hungry.In a post on Instagram, Jake Gyllenhaal, who read a Jamie Lee Curtis story called Where Do Balloons Go?, wrote that the charities would “support food banks, and mobile meal trucks, and community feeding programs” to help the estimated 30 million US children who rely on school meals.The show has more than 120,000 followers and the videos have been viewed more than 27m times, with an estimated 18,000 donations so far.“I don’t have any children, but I’ve been watching the videos,” Betsy Zorio, the head of Save the Children’s US programmes and advocacy, told the Hollywood Reporter. “They’ve become a nice little way to take a break during the day and get your mind off the shortage of toilet paper.”On Thursday, Dolly Parton will start her own weekly online storytelling programme by reading The Little Engine That Could. The country star and Glastonbury favourite said the Goodnight With Dolly series on YouTube should act as “a welcome distraction during a time of unrest and also inspire a love of reading and books”.Parton’s charity Imagination Library, which she started in 1996, has delivered more than 130m free books to children, making her known simply as “the book lady” to a generation who might have never heard her songs such as Jolene.Unorthodox choices to get children off to sleep are nothing new. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the BBC recruited the likes of the Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, the Batman and Venom star Tom Hardy and the Captain America actor Chris Evans as narrators for its CBeebies Bedtime Story.With coronavirus perhaps leaving stars with as little to do as much of the rest of the population, a swathe of other names are now doing the same. Other celebrities recruited for the Save the Children campaign include Jimmy Fallon and Gal Gadot, who has already had one Covid-19 viral moment when she appeared in a much maligned celebrity-packed cover version of John Lennon’s Imagine.The bedtime story trend has reached beyond the usual celebrity circles, with the former attorney general and Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox adding his name to the list of night-time narrators.“I’ve been asked to record a children’s bedtime story for while we are cooped up in CV confinement,” he wrote in a tweet introducing his story. Cox chose The Stone Monkey, a Chinese fairytale told by the Victorian author and Chinese language and culture scholar Herbert Allen Giles in what Cox described as “a beautiful little pamphlet” of tales published in 1911. “I hope you enjoy it,” he added.Before becoming attorney general under Theresa May, Cox was arguably best known for having the highest outside earnings in parliament, because he continued to work as a QC while serving as an MP in Devon.Now the politician, whose booming oration was described as sounding like “Uncle Monty played by Brian Blessed”, has joined the ranks of well-known bedtime storytellers. There were suggestions Cox should start narrating audiobooks after a clip of him reading A Visit from St Nicholas, more commonly known as ‘Twas The Night Before Christmas, was widely circulated in December last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ffd59e90238a4ee6815ed256e586639c37f4255/30_0_3465_2081/master/3465.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ff59bb0a21d7aa32b5b697310e64c0bc","title":"coronavirus retreat california harbor wealthy","story":"The Harbor offered a two-month retreat in a villa where guests could ‘meet and mingle and collaborate – no facemask required’A luxurious southern California retreat for wealthy participants to wait out the coronavirus pandemic has folded before the program could even open its doors.As millions of Americans face strict social distancing orders amid the pandemic, the “Harbor” proposed the opposite for those who could afford it: a two-month retreat in an exclusive villa where guests could “meet, mingle and collaborate with some of the brightest, forward-thinking iniduals – no facemask required”.The Harbor advertised drum circles and movie nights for more than a dozen guests, albeit with an “on-boarding health check”, at a cost of between $3,000 and $6,000 per person per month.A website calling for applications to join the retreat was launched by Jay Jideliov, the chief executive officer of NYC tech company Callision, this month and quickly drew national attention.But on Wednesday, following backlash and confusion surrounding where the retreat would be hosted, the co-founders Jideliov and Mikhail Larionov told the  they had decided to close the project.“We have decided to close the Harbor open call based on the latest recommendations from the White House and the CDC, and will provide updates as the situation develops”, they said.The decision also came after legal threats from the Palm Springs property company whose rental home was used to advertise the retreat, and who say they knew nothing about the plan.“We do not know the folks from Harbor, I have no idea why they took an image of a house off our website,” a spokesman from Purveyors of Leisure told the . “I frankly do not think their plan is very good and I would not rent to them if they called us.”The viral episode underscores ongoing tension around how the wealthy are dealing with coronavirus, as celebrities post videos from poolside isolation in their mansions and influencers seemingly jump to the front of the line for coronavirus testing.On Saturday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel advisory, urging people in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey to “refrain from non-essential domestic travel” for the next two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area covid 19","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Eager to catch up with his birds, Lewis beelined it to his office when he got back to work. “The first thing I did,” he says, “was go and check on my eagle tags.”One bird in particular, Golden Eagle 1703, gave him pause. Lewis knew the animal well. He had tagged it on 26 July 2017, when it was still a nestling on a rocky outcrop in Denali national park and preserve. Even before it knew how to fly, 1703 displayed its might by leaping from its nest and gliding a quarter mile down a valley to evade Lewis’s initial attempt at tagging it. After a short hike, Lewis and his team retrieved the squawking bundle of black and white feathers, outfitted it with the tracking device, and returned it safely to its nest.In the 18 months that followed, 1703 flourished. The bird traversed about 8,000 miles, from Denali to Wyoming, all the way back up to Alaska’s North Slope, where it probably feasted on waterfowl and perhaps a straggling caribou calve of two. From there, it carved a long, treacherous path south through the wilderness of western Canada and worked its way back to the lower 48 to hunker down for its second winter on Earth.Little is known about what golden eagles do in the liminal years between leaving their parents’ nest and settling down to build a nest of their own. Each ping from 1703’s solar-powered GPS revealed a tiny part of the picture, offering a rare glimpse of an apex predator as it learned the ropes of the natural world. “It takes four or five years for them to reach maturity,” Lewis says, “and it’s unknown how long it actually takes them to then compete and get into the breeding population. So you have to follow a bird for years.”But now, staring at his computer screen on that January morning, Lewis could see that 1703’s location device was stationary in Sully county, South Dakota, and had been so for two days. “It was seeing the sun and talking to the satellites,” Lewis says, “but it wasn’t moving.”It’s not uncommon for Lewis to lose a bird. Since 2014, he, along with colleagues from the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey, have tagged 49 golden eagles in Alaska as part of a broader effort to understand their biology, behavior and population trends. Of those birds, only 17 are still being monitored. Sometimes the GPS device malfunctions or the eagle shakes free from it. Other times the bird dies.“It’s a tough world out there,” Lewis tells me, “especially for eagles.” They can starve to death or get electrocuted by high wires or be decapitated by wind turbines. None of those fates, however, seemed likely in the rolling farmland of Sully county.Hoping to get a sense of what went wrong, Lewis opened a souped-up version of Google Earth, plugged in the last GPS coordinates he had for 1703, and began looking around the virtual landscape. There was a nearby road, a line of trees, acres of empty land, and what looked to be a farmhouse. “It definitely felt suspicious,” Lewis says.He called up a Fish and Wildlife office in Pierre, South Dakota, and asked if anyone could go check on a downed eagle tag.Richard Bare wasn’t sure whether to be pissed off or deeply disappointed by the prospect of having to retrieve yet another dead eagle. “I first and foremost suspected a shooting because we were having a rash of eagle shootings,” says Bare, a special agent with FWS’s office of law enforcement, who was stationed in South Dakota at the time. In the five weeks leading up to 1703’s death, he had responded to a bald eagle shooting and two separate golden eagle shootings. None of the birds survived, and he found no evidence to suggest the incidents were related. The case of 1703 seemed like more of the same.While the average American might be shocked to learn of an eagle being intentionally blasted from the sky, those who work in wildlife law enforcement know it’s an alarmingly common problem. According to one FWS report, somewhere in the range of 1,000 golden eagles are shot each year. Sometimes it’s poachers who want to sell the bird’s feathers on the black market, other times it’s ranchers who want to keep the e-bombing predators from snatching their livestock.Bare, who has been a special agent since 2016 and before that spent close to a decade in the field as an FWS game warden (the outdoor world’s equivalent of a beat cop) ballparks that over the course of his career he’s dealt with upwards of 200 cases involving eagles – shootings, poisonings, collisions with cars, starvations. “If you asked me about any other eagle, I probably wouldn’t remember it,” he says. But 1703 “was a flashbulb event” because the weather was memorably miserable, even by South Dakota standards. A punishing cold snap had plunged temperatures well below zero while sustained winds of 50mph ripped across the plains.After a quick chat with Lewis, Bare loaded his cold-weather gear into his truck and hit the road. 1703’s GPS tracker was pinging about five miles north-west of where the Oahe Dam cuts across the Missouri River to form Lake Oahe, one of the nation’s largest man-made reservoirs and fertile hunting ground for birds of prey.When Bare arrived at the location, he saw all the same features that had popped up on Lewis’s computer screen – the quiet country road, the shelter belt of trees and the farmhouse, which in real life was dilapidated and long ago abandoned. A firm layer of snow crunched under his boots as he walked across the field, scanning the ground for any signs of an eagle or an errant GPS tag. Then, among the knee-high wheat reeds that poked through the frozen landscape, Bare spotted what looked to be a clump of tail feathers. He took out his camera and began documenting everything. “Even though something might not be a criminal investigation, I have to treat it as such and maintain the integrity of the evidence,” he says, “the evidence being the eagle in this case.”Only two species of eagles are native to the US – the bald eagle and the golden eagle – and few animals in the world enjoy as many legal protections as they do. In addition to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Lacy Act, which regulates the trade of wildlife, they are privy to the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a federal statute that threatens steep fines and jail time for anyone caught killing eagles, disrupting their nests, or generally interfering with the birds.Passed in 1940, the law was originally designed to protect only bald eagles. At the time, the species was teetering on the edge of extinction in the contiguous US as a result of hunting, habitat loss and the toxic effects of DDT. In 1962, Congress amended the act to include golden eagles. Nearly 50 years later, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has proven to be a godsend, at least for bald eagles. The national bird is widely considered one of the 20th century’s greatest environmental comeback stories: in 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs lived in the lower 48. Today well over 10,000 pairs can be found from the suburbs of Boston to garbage dumps near Seattle.Golden eagles haven’t been as lucky. While they are not classified as an endangered or threatened species, they certainly aren’t thriving. FWS estimates that in 1967, there were 31,813 golden eagles in the US. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the agency estimated there were 31,477 golden eagles in our skies. It’s a remarkable stretch of stability, but it’s unclear if the numbers can hold as wind farms rise across the western US and myriad pressures from habitat loss, environmental degradation and the climate crisis push down on raptors and the animals they prey upon.With so many threats looming, Bare knows as well as anyone that the last thing golden eagles need are people shooting them out of the sky. After a few minutes of photographing the area, he dug 1703’s frozen carcass out from under the snow and gave it a once over in the wind-whipped field. Much to his surprise, there were no overt signs of trauma – no bloody bullet hole or broken wing or spilled guts. The bird weighed more than 7lb and, aside from being dead, looked to be in good shape. Still, there was no telling what type of damage might be lurking under its plumage. Bare zipped 1703 into a small body bag and chewed over the possibilities on his drive back to the office.A day or two later, a preliminary X-ray seemed to support his original hunch when it revealed two metal fragments near one of 1703’s wings. “It resembled the approximate diameter of buckshot,” Bare says. Following protocol, he packed 1703 on ice and FedExed it to the National Fish \u0026amp Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon.Like that, 1703 had gone from a high-flying predator to commercial cargo.On any given day, a menagerie of dead animals passes through the FWS’s forensics lab. From the outside, the building looks like most any other government facility – squat, gray, plenty of parking. Inside, it’s filled with sophisticated laboratory equipment and staffed by a small, exquisitely specialized team of scientists whose disciplines range from herpetology to ornithology to ballistics to genetics. When it comes to analyzing evidence of animal-related crimes and building scientifically sound prosecutions against wildlife traffickers, poachers and others who inflict harm on nature’s inhabitants, there is no better place on earth.Like any potential murder victim, 1703 underwent a full postmortem in hopes of pinpointing the cause of death. That task fell to Rebecca Kagan, one of two staff pathologists at the lab. If there’s a federally protected animal that dies under mysterious circumstances, there’s a decent chance it will end up on Kagan’s exam table. One day it’s an endangered Mexican gray wolf the next day an eagle.“We get a lot of bald and golden eagles,” Kagan laments. In 2019, she and the other pathologist at the lab necropsied about 100 eagles total, including 1703. Managing an endless stream of suspiciously dead animals can be bleak. But Kagan keeps a sharp sense of humor – she jokes that she always carves the bird at Thanksgiving – and finds comfort in knowing that her work is ultimately in service of conservation. Sometimes a necropsy yields evidence that helps finger the bad guy. Other times her efforts reveal that there wasn’t any foul play, just the lethal hand of Mother Nature at work.Kagan unpacked 1703 on 13 February 2019, roughly three weeks after Lewis first noticed its GPS at a standstill. Dribs of a red-brown fluid leaked from the bird’s mouth when she tilted its carcass. She checked the esophagus and it was empty. She checked the crop, a pouch-like structure near the upper part of the digestive tract, and found a 3.5oz blob of partially masticated muscle and fat mixed with a few white hairs that looked like they came from a deer. “The nutritional condition was good,” Kagan recalls. “This bird didn’t starve to death.”Slowly and methodically, she worked 1703 over, inspecting and documenting every inch of its insides and outsides. A large amount of “watery, red-tinged” excrement pooled in its cloaca and its gall bladder contained “scant, yellow-green, watery bile”, according to the necropsy report.Kagan eventually arrived at the two metal pellets that showed up on the preliminary X-ray only to discover that they were nothing more than tiny remnants from the GPS harness. Hours spent deconstructing 1703, and the cause of death wasn’t any clearer. “It’s a little frustrating,” she tells me. “We really checked everything with this bird.”As a final step, she shipped 1703’s liver to Michigan State University for a detailed toxicology analysis. A few weeks later the results came back positive for bromadiolone, better known as rat poison.Even if you’ve never heard of bromadiolone or its chemical counterparts –brodifacoum difenacoum and difethialone – chances are you’ve been in close proximity to them. They are known as “second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides”, a popular class of poisons that essentially kills a rodent by making it bleed to death from the inside out. Exterminators stuff these poisons in those black plastic bait boxes that you see everywhere in cities – down alleys, on the sides of restaurants, in condo buildings’ parking lots – and they are deployed throughout the agricultural sector to keep germ-carrying rodents away from food supplies.These poisons came to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and were “extremely widely embraced” from the get-go, says Bobby Corrigan, an esteemed rodentologist who has spent his career studying and consulting on pest control practices. “It was kind of a magic bullet of advanced chemistry.”Corrigan frequently preaches the importance of addressing the root causes of rodent infestations – improving trash storage and collection, addressing degrading infrastructure – and is unsettled by the widespread reliance on second-generation anticoagulants and lax enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict their use. But – and this is an important, he says – the sad truth is that we are dependent on these poisons. Forgoing them entirely would lead to an explosion in rodent populations that could usher in “a public health catastrophe”.One reason these poisons are so effective is because, in most cases, the rat or ground squirrel or vole or whatever the target vermin happens to be only needs to eat a single dose. The poison works quickly, and the critter typically doesn’t have time to excrete any of the poison before it keels over. In other words, a rat that dies from a second-generation anticoagulant often dies with a belly fully of poison. And if a scavenger comes along and plucks up the rodent corpse, it, too, will be exposed to the poison. It’s a process that scientists call bioaccumulation, and it occurs all the way up the food chain.The toxicology report for 1703 showed that it had 0.05 parts per million of bromadiolone in its liver. Murray says it’s unlikely that’s enough to directly kill an eagle, but there’s not really any good data on what the lethal threshold is for a bird of that size. If the poison didn’t deal the fatal blow, I ask, could it have impaired 1703 in a way that made the bird less capable of hunting or migrating or withstanding the winter and thus contributing to its death? Again, Murray says, it’s an important question to which there’s no answer. And even worse, it’s becoming an increasingly difficult question to study because, Murray explains, so many raptors in the wild now have rodenticide in them that it’s almost impossible to find enough birds that are free of rat poison to serve as a control group.Because of all the uncertainty around how the poisons affect birds, Kagan listed the final cause of death on 1703’s necropsy report as “undetermined (suspect poison)”. It’s a fate that many golden eagles suffer. While data is scarce, FWS scientists estimate that poisonings are now the leading cause of anthropogenic-induced death among golden eagles, possibly killing as many as 2,000 a year.Kagan’s exam table was the end of the line for 1703. Sometimes an eagle can be sent to the National Eagle Feather Repository, which distributes deceased eagles to Native American tribes so they can use the animals for ceremonial purposes. 1703 would not find any such greater meaning in death, however, because the feather repository, according to an FWS spokesperson, cannot distribute eagles exposed to rodenticides.On 7 March 2019, Kagan filed the official necropsy report and moved on to the next animal carcass in her queue.Without any evidence of a clearcut crime and an ever-expanding caseload, Bare closed the file on 1703 and retrained his focus on the spate of eagle shootings.And out in Juneau, Lewis logged 1703’s data and carried on monitoring the 17 other golden eagles that are still tagged and up in the air, hoping they avoid the wind turbines and high-voltage wires and blasts of buckshot and poisoned prey that have made the natural world so unnaturally dangerous for the species.“I know that death is a reality,” Lewis says, “but it’s really frustrating when it seems like it’s a senseless death.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36bb1f94fd7c20755c97ce69cf104d318ba5e038/217_0_2446_1468/master/2446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4036c72b489f24f6fb1ec94acd187b4b","title":"life in lockdown how is your family coping","story":"The Anywhere but Westminster team would like your help to create the next episode of Life in LockdownWe’re putting together the next episode of Anywhere but Westminster’s Life in Lockdown series.

On Wednesday the Steel City had the fourth highest number in any local authority in England (541), behind Surrey (571), Hampshire (652) and Birmingham (734).The figures have led some to worry that Sheffield – home to 575,400 people, compared with Birmingham’s 1.1 million – has become a hotbed of disease. Research from the Centre for Cities on Tuesday prompted further consternation by breaking the data down by population size and reporting that Sheffield was second only to London in terms of cases per 100,000 people.But local hospitals and public health experts are playing down the statistics. “The figures are misleading and alarming. People look at them and think, ‘Oh gosh, we’re all going to get it’ and ‘Sheffield is a high-risk area’, but that’s not true,” said Dr Andrew Lee, a reader of global public health at Sheffield University and executive director of primary care and population health at NHS Vale of York clinical commissioning group.So far, 21 patients have died in hospitals in Sheffield, while the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust, which operates the city’s two big hospitals, the Northern General and the Royal Hallamshire, says they are currently treating “a comparatively low level” of coronavirus patients.Talking in his academic capacity, Lee despaired at the Public Health England daily dashboard, which lists the number of cases in each local authority in England. “That tracker is really misleading. In some senses they should just turn it off because everywhere is testing differently. So you can’t compare place A with place B with place C. And it’s not like you’re just following a score because the interpretation of those numbers is really complicated,” he said.The main reason Sheffield has such a high number of cases is that it has been testing more people and testing earlier, according to Lee. The Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust took the decision to test all symptomatic NHS workers 11 days before most other areas, the  understands.It was only this week that the rest of the NHS was ordered by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, to start testing staff, starting with those working in critical care, emergency departments and ambulance services.Healthcare workers were disproportionately likely to get infected, said Lee. “If you look at what happened with Mers-Covid, when they had that big outbreak in South Korea some years ago, most of the cases were in health workers. And the same with Sars in 2003-4. It just reflects the fact healthcare workers have high-risk, prolonged contacts with patients. Healthcare workers are not representative of the wider public.”The Northern General medic said the widespread testing in Sheffield meant that infected staff stayed at home while those who tested negative could come in to work. “I know five or six people in my team were sure they had it and tested negative, and yet a few others who were adamant it was just a cold turned out to have coronavirus,” they said.Another reason for Sheffield’s high figures is that the Royal Hallamshire is home to one of England’s few specialist NHS infection centres. That is why, when the first coronavirus patients arrived in the UK from the cruise ship the Diamond Princess, two were sent there.In addition, Sheffield has experienced a few “Covid clusters”, according to a spokeswoman at the hospitals trust. “I know we did have some clusters of people that we tested in the community, which had a wide contract testing base, which made the Sheffield figures look larger,” she said. These clusters were largely groups returning from Italy and other infected regions, she added.She said the trust saw two million patients each year – four times the population of Sheffield – but that they were not currently treating many Covid-19 patients.“It’s a bit like watching the tide go out before the tsunami comes in,” said the Northern General medic. “We are not overwhelmed yet, but we have all seen what has happened in London and we know what’s coming. We are hoping the lockdown will make it not as bad, but it depends who you talk to how much you believe whether we are going to be saved or not.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c773f03328d341a0992ce8c5034ec383ce637429/0_152_3015_1809/master/3015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35fd63f3a15b662c4f3ecf4b9f7168ea","title":"viktor orban ditches mayor plan amid claims of coronavirus power grab","story":"Hungary’s prime minister criticised for inefficient and unworkable measuresHungary’s nationalist government announced measures to strip the country’s mayors of political autonomy, before appearing to ditch them hours later, the latest episode in a political drama in which the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has been accused of using the coronavirus to mount a power grab.On Monday, Hungary’s parliament passed a law that gives Orbán the right to rule by decree for an indefinite period and also criminalises intentionally spreading false information about coronavirus with up to five years in prison. The move was roundly criticised by Orbán’s domestic and international critics.It was followed up by a bill of further measures published late on Tuesday evening that would target municipal authorities and mayors, many of whom are from opposition parties. During the state of emergency, mayors can take on the decision-making abilities of local councils, but the new regulation would submit these decisions to a review that could take up to five days.The move was immediately criticised as inefficient and unworkable, and later on Wednesday Gergely Gulyás, the chief of Orbán’s cabinet, said the government would not follow through on the measure.Budapest’s mayor, Gergely Karácsony, had warned that the measures risked increasing the loss of life due to coronavirus.“I think this proposition is dangerous not only for our democracy but it also makes the fight against coronavirus very difficult,” he said, in remarks emailed to the  by a spokesperson before Gulyás’ announcement. “If soldiers, policemen and Fidesz delegates have to decide on local government issues they do not even know or understand and have five days to do so, we are losing precious time in saving lives. If this proposition is accepted it could cause the death rate to rise.”Karácsony beat Orbán’s candidate in elections last October, standing on a platform of a greener and fairer city. Orbán’s party lost control of a number of big cities, including Budapest, in what was his first significant electoral setback for a decade.As of Wednesday morning, Hungary had 525 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 20 deaths. Opinion is ided on whether the country may avoid the nightmare scenario unfolding in many western European countries currently, due to relatively early restrictions on movement imposed by the government, or whether the epidemic is simply a couple of weeks behind and will soon enter an exponential growth phase.In a sign that even during a pandemic the Hungarian government has not ceased its rightwing culture battle, another part of the bill submitted on Tuesday would make it impossible for transgender people to legally alter their gender. The bill would introduce “gender at birth” into the Hungarian civil registry, in place of “gender”, and make the entry unalterable.Responding to Orbán’s power grab, Luxembourg’s veteran foreign minister Jean Asselborn said Hungary should be stripped of its right to take part in the EU council of ministers, the union’s prime decision-making body. “Hungary belongs in strict political quarantine,” he told Die Welt. “We cannot accept the fact that there is a dictatorial government in the EU.”The European commission has come under fire for its muted response to the Hungarian law that failed to mention Hungary by name. On Wednesday, the president of the European People’s Party, Donald Tusk, said the group would have to reconsider its earlier reluctance to expel Orbán’s Fidesz party from its ranks. In an open letter to the EPP - the centre-right political family long accused of turning a blind eye to Orbán’s excesses - Tusk said Hungary’s emergency measures were “disproportionate and inadequate”. But Tusk stopped short of saying that he supported Fidesz’s expulsion and was accused of failing to take a stand.Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b73d970f251da5617be9a1651cd174504993bfbb/182_0_4137_2483/master/4137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797c635b3f7b3d58f609e1daa1f9b333","title":"what are your rights in lockdown britain coronavirus","story":"Can you exercise more than once a day? How often can you shop? We explain what is allowed and what is notSince the introduction of strict new measures to stem the spread of coronavirus, not everybody has been in agreement as to what exactly “lockdown” means. One police force has defended its use of a drone camera to shame those driving into a national park, while another introduced roadblocks to stop people heading to tourist hotspots.The extraordinary official powers introduced by the Coronavirus Act and the 2020 Health Protection Regulations, combined with the speed with which legislation passed through parliament, have left many uncertain about precisely what is permitted and what is a criminal offence under the lockdown.Activities under the health regulations that constitute a “reasonable excuse” for leaving home are listed (alphabetically from A to M). They include obtaining food and medical supplies, taking “exercise either alone or with other members of their household”, seeking medical assistance, and providing care to a vulnerable person.Also permitted is attending a funeral of a close family member, “to move house where reasonably necessary”, and any existing arrangements for access between separated parents and children. Travel for the purposes of work where it cannot be carried out from home, similarly for the provision of voluntary services, is also legal.The problem has been that ministers and officials, eager to prevent transmission of the coronavirus, are circulating more restrictive guidance than is in statute or the regulations. Some police forces have been following their lead.On Tuesday, Downing Street was forced to clarify that people could go out to buy food more than once a week, after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, mistakenly said shopping trips should be limited.A Home Office announcement from 26 March said iniduals could only leave their homes for “very limited purposes” including “one form of exercise a day”. Some police force websites also initially listed exercise as being allowed only “once a day”. The health regulations, however, do not say anything about permitted frequency. Police have powers to order anyone to return home if they judge that they are out without reasonable excuse. Officers can also order anyone with a child to take a non-compliant youngster home. Where three or more people are gathered without reasonable excuse, they can be ordered to disperse.The latest police guidance on enforcement does not specify what forms of proof would be required if, for example, someone says they are going to care for a vulnerable relative. It states that officers will apply the law “in a system that is flexible, discretionary ad pragmatic. This will enable officers to make sensible decisions and employ their judgement. Enforcement should be a last resort.”Failure to comply is punishable by a fine. Fixed penalty notices are £60, or £30 if paid within 14 days. For subsequent penalty notices, fines can rise to as high as £960. Those who do not pay can be taken to court.The courts are not hearing many cases at the moment, but anyone who feels they have been fined inappropriately can go to court to contest it. Civil liberties organisations might contemplate supporting legal challenges in future if they think fines are being imposed unfairly and the lockdown continues for a long period.

Gracie Bradley, policy and campaigns manager at the human rights organisation Liberty, said this week: “There have been amazing community responses to this pandemic, and people have shown they are willing to change the way they live – but that goodwill, and the broader aim of protecting public health, will be undermined by harsh and heavy-handed policing.”Katy Bourne, chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said: “We are rightly proud of our policing by consent model in this country, and PCCs know that, in order for these measures to be truly effective, the police will need to maintain public confidence. That means calmly engaging, explaining and encouraging people to do the right thing, not being overzealous, and only taking enforcement measures as a last resort.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest apr 2 global","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was “deeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection”, adding: “Over the past five weeks, we have witnessed a near-exponential growth in the number of new cases reaching almost every country, territory and area.“The number of deaths has more than doubled in the past week. In the next few days, we will reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths.”According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, at least 932,605 people have now been infected around the world, though suspected underreporting by various countries means the figure is likely to be significantly higher.The researchers have counted at least 46,809 deaths, while they say 193,177 people have recovered.British newspapers, including those normally supportive of the Conservatives, lambasted the Tory government over shortages of equipment as it emerged that just 2,000 of half a million frontline National Health Service staff had been tested.Ministers have been coming under increasing pressure to explain their plans and the  detailed the unravelling of the government’s initial testing strategy – and the valuable time it wasted.A key UN climate summit that was due to take place in Glasgow in November has been postponed until 2021. “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19,” organisers said.Activists acknowledged that the move was necessary, but urged governments not to forget the climate crisis even as they deal with the pandemic.France becomes the fourth country to pass the 4,000 threshold, following Italy, Spain and the US.The daily government tally accounts only for those dying in hospitals, but authorities say they will soon be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes, which is likely to result in a big increase in registered fatalities. The current total is 4,032 people.The personnel will be assigned to help with the UK’s pandemic response, bringing the strength of the armed forces’ virus response to about 23,000. They will be needed to help with medical and logistical support for the NHS and to act as liaison officers, among other things.No one working for the National Health Service or delivering frontline services will be mobilised, officials say.The US president says the federal stockpile of personal protective equipment is nearly empty, “because we’re sending it directly to hospitals”. Earlier, CNN reported that the “Strategic National Stockpile is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory, depleting the bulk of its protective gear”.American officials reportedly believe China has been underreporting the total number of cases and deaths. The conclusions of a classified report from the intelligence community to the White House were revealed to Bloomberg by three anonymous officials who declined to give details about its contents.They reportedly say the thrust was that China’s concealment was deliberate and that the report was received by the White House last week.Physical distancing measures have been extended in Germany until at least 19 April and will be re-evaluated on the Tuesday after Easter, Angela Merkel has said.The German chancellor spoke after a telephone conference with the premiers of Germany’s 16 states on Wednesday afternoon, in which they agreed a draft resolution urging people “to keep contact with people beyond their own household to an absolute minimum, even during the Easter holidays, in accordance with the applicable rules”, according to German media cited by the broadcaster Deutsche Welle.Another 727 people have died in Italy, taking the total to 13,155. That represents the smallest increase since 26 March. Nevertheless, figures from the Civil Protection Agency show that the number of new cases rose more sharply than a few days earlier, growing by 4,782 compared with 4,053.Lockdown measures in the country are to be extended to 13 April, the health minister, Roberto Speranza, has said. He told the Senate on Wednesday: “We must not confuse the first positive signals with an ‘all clear’ signal. Data shows that we are on the right path and that the drastic decisions are bearing fruit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c1c292576e1ea2ebca52eb9f7f5b5dd7d6da543/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5b9bd53347a60be062196e747786ee3","title":"coronavirus six in 10 british firms have no more than three months of cash left","story":"British Chambers of Commerce poll reveals scale of companies at risk of collapse amid coronavirus lockdownBusiness leaders have warned that British companies are running out of time to stay afloat amid the coronavirus outbreak, after a survey showed a majority of firms had just three months of cash or less in reserve.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said companies across the country were suffering from a sharp and significant fall in domestic and overseas sales as lockdown measures brought many firms close to collapse, threatening widespread job losses.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.Almost 1m small businesses across Britain are feared to be at risk of collapsing within the next month as they struggle to secure emergency cash, despite the government’s efforts to cushion the economic blow and the Bank of England lowering interest rates to provide cheap financing.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has pledged unprecedented aid, including tax holidays, loan guarantees and paying workers’ wages. However, businesses and MPs have raised concerns that there are gaps in the schemes.Mervyn King, speaking at a webinar organised by the Policy Exchange thinktank, said banks needed to stay open in order to help their customers cope with the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis.“It is surprising that most bank branches are closed,” the former Bank of England governor said, adding that the reason the banks had been bailed out in 2008 was because of their important role in stabilising the economy. “Banks need to be there to talk to customers and to make sure the loans to businesses are there.”Lord King added: “Banks need to give clear instructions to their staff. They are part of the essential system that keeps the economy going. Supermarkets make their customers queue outside and allow only a limited number of people in at any one time. I can’t see why the banks should not be open if they abide by the same restrictions.”Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, said the pandemic had taken a heavy toll on business and economic activity across the UK. He urged the government to speed up its response to the crisis to avoid further unnecessary damage.“While businesses have welcomed the unprecedented size and scope of the government support packages, our findings highlight the urgent need for that support to reach businesses on the ground as soon as possible. The majority of firms cannot wait weeks or months for help to arrive,” he said.Several companies have announced plans. The no-frills chain Poundland is to mothball about one in 10 stores and lay off 250 head office staff, while Whitbread, the owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain and restaurants including Beefeater and Brewers Fayre, has said it would put some employees on a furlough while its sites remained closed.Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the scale of unemployment in Britain would be “unimaginable” if the government had not agreed to subsidise wages.“This survey shows just how swift the impact of this economic crisis is being felt by firms and workers,” he added.April would usually herald the start of the year’s busiest trading period for Becca Luger’s cake company, Crumpet Cakes. In her decade running the business, she has moved into selling her home-baked cakes and biscuits at large shows, festivals and events in her hometown of Bristol and around the south-west.Restrictions on gatherings of people, in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, has led to cancellation of about 25 events where Luger was due to sell her products between April and June, leaving her without any income.“I am very event-based, and if by August or September we are still in a state of lockdown that’s most of my trading year gone, so what have I got left? It is very bleak for a lot of businesses,” Luger said.Like many businesses surveyed by the BCC, the cake company owner believes she has a little more than a month’s cash available to keep her business running.Luger had hoped to apply for government help, but believes she falls between several support schemes. She runs her business from a unit in a shared workspace and contributes her share of the business rates for the building, which is classed as a warehouse and therefore not eligible for rent relief.As a one-person limited company, Luger believes she doesn’t qualify for the government’s self-employment package."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228507a7bae5ea7f8c74530b2d511642f47d403f/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0280e7bae203c307cf28a00c5b88f1c0","title":"when this is all over im not going to stop hugging my friends","story":"As coronavirus keeps us apart, I have developed a very wholesome thirst for the physical intimacy we used to have with friends and family Lately, when I find myself reaching for my phone for a distraction, it’s no longer just to mindlessly swipe through Instagram stories and semi-ironically decipher my horoscope. Instead, I catch myself constantly returning to my camera roll. In particular, the photos where I’m touching my family and friends.There’s the fuzzy Christmas party set of my colleagues and I, all cheek to cheek, craning our heads to get in a series of group selfies. There’s a backyard family lunch, me with my arm slung over my mum’s shoulder. There’s a day at the beach with my sister and her kid, us each holding a hand as we drag her back to the car. And there’s Mardis Gras night. It was just a few weeks ago but today the photos feel as though they belong in a history book. Friends and strangers covered in glitter and sweat, dancing close at a street party, arms wrapped around waists, exuberant kisses being planted on faces, all of us joyfully, drunkenly close to each other and vigorously engaged in whatever the opposite of social distancing is.I’m experiencing a new and very wholesome kind of thirst.As the coronavirus crisis deepens, we are moving further and further away from each other. If we’re lucky enough to still have a job, we are mostly working from home. The latest wave of lockdown restrictions have made seeing friends and family outside the home almost impossible (unless you’re wearing activewear). Even the physical proximity of strangers has evaporated. We leave bigger and bigger gaps as we pass on the street and step back from each other in the supermarket. If you live alone, it might be weeks since you touched another person, and months before you will again.One of the greatest paradoxes of this moment is most of us are feeling more tender and afraid than we ever have, and want nothing more than to pull close the people we love, to seek reassurance and comfort. Yet, for the first time in our lives, unless we live together, we can’t do this – not physically, at least.This is all the sadder because touch – when it’s wanted, when it’s caring – is so good for us. It connects us to each other. It is our most primal form of communication. Years of research suggests it’s beneficial for our physical and mental health, lifting our mood and decreasing stress. Newborn babies thrive on skin-to-skin contact. Every kid knows the power of “kissing it better” when you get hurt, or being patted off to sleep by a reassuring hand.Adults too can experience a true “skin hunger” when they go long periods without touch, as the illustrator Kristen Radtke explored in the New York Times this week.Right now though most of us are so wary of touch, even of hugging our parents.I saw my mum last week and she moved towards me on pure instinct, her arms out. I jumped back, like a teenager about to get an embarrassing goodbye kiss at the school gate. We may yet all need to do what the mother of the ABC journalist Emilia Terzon did last week – building ingenious protective “cuddle suits” out of garbage bags so they could give each other a squeeze.Even one of the most familiar rituals in most families – greeting returning loved ones at the airport with wide open arms – is impossible now. Last week my sister, her wife and their three-year-old daughter arrived home from New York after beating a hasty retreat from their life in a city rapidly descending into a public health nightmare. They have another baby due in a couple of months. No one could even go to the airport to meet them, let alone embrace them.When I have seen them, it is with a gulf between us. I drop groceries and bottles of wine on the stoop of the Airbnb where they are quarantining, then retreat back to the front gate to sit out on the footpath when my sister comes to the door.My niece has to be physically restrained from barrelling out of the house towards visitors. A champion hugger, hair-messer and tickler, not being able to be physical with her grandparents, extended family or friends means she has become exponentially more handsy with her mums. “She crawls at the walls, she crawls on us,” my sister says.With all this touch deprivation, the most common wish I see expressed among people on social media is to hug their friends and family when this is all over. That is unless you’ve been forced into celibacy, in which case you’re naturally concerned with  another kind of physical intimacy.“The world is going to be an intense cuddle puddle on the streets,” my friend Que Minh Luu tweeted last week. “It’ll be like that iconic end of the world war photo, except with active consent.”When this is over, I for one cannot wait to go HAM on all my friends. I daydream about the first dancefloor we can get on, wrapping them up and smooshing their faces. I will never not let my mum hold my hand again, no matter where we are. I will let my toddler niece use me as a human climbing gym and I look forward to nibbling on the fat little legs of her new sibling. If everyone I love makes it through this, I want to put my arms around them all. We’ll need it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

Follow the latest updates. A lot of people are quoting TS Eliot’s The Wasteland at the moment, because it starts “April is the cruellest month,” but none so well as – strangely enough – the chair of Columbia University’s surgery department, who wrote in an update: Writing on April 1, late in the day, I can’t possibly be the first person to shout out the first four lines of “The Wasteland” (TS Eliot). But first or not, I can’t resist: “April is the cruelest month, breeding  Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing  Memory and desire, stirring  Dull roots with spring rain.” The rest of the poem is much too long, too grim and overwrought for my taste. The line-breaks that highlight three verbs (breeding, mixing, stirring) are a nice writerly touch, but I admire it most for one phrase—mixing memory and desire. In an April that may be apocalyptically cruel, that is how we are poised, desiring spring.Time for the UK front pages now. The unfolding coronavirus testing fiasco dominates the major UK newspaper front pages after the daily death toll hit climbed to a new record and it emerged that only 2,000 NHS staff had been tested.“Shambles” says the Mirror’s headline alongside pictures of the latest two health workers to die from the disease – including retired doctor Alfa Saadu, 68, who was volunteering at the Queen Victoria memorial hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire.The Mirror also has a picture of an empty drive-through testing station in Chessington, Surrey to emphasise its point – an image also used across the width of the Times’ front page under the headline “Virus testing plans in chaos”.The Mail focuses on the “statistic that humbles ministers” with the headline “550,000 NHS staff only 2,000 tested”, in what it calls the “latest shocking example of our testing scandal”. It goes on to claim that its reporting has “finally” stung Boris Johnson into action, and quotes the prime minister as promising to “massively increase” testing.The  also wonders about the testing disaster with the headline “Questions without answers” over a picture of the business secretary, Alok Sharma, at Wednesday’s Downing Street media briefing. The paper – which has carried many front page pictures of Johnson portraying his policy in a positive light – says the government was unable to explain why its testing strategy was failing, why so few NHS staff had been tested and how it was going to manage an exit from the lockdown.The FT reports on the damage to the economy and says “Jobless claims rocket by 1m as virus delivers shock to economy”.You can read the full roundup in our story below: A major NHS hospital almost ran out of oxygen for its Covid-19 patients on ventilators because it was treating so many people with the disease who needed help to breathe.The incident, which occurred at a London teaching hospital last weekend, has prompted NHS bosses to urgently warn all NHS trusts in England to limit the number of people they put on mechanical ventilators and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines.NHS England was so concerned by what happened that it told hospital bosses in a letter on Monday that the risk constituted a “critical safety concern” which could have major consequences for all patients relying on oxygen to stay alive. It told them to take a series of urgent actions to reduce the risk of their own oxygen supply suddenly running short because of heavy demand.Covid-19 infections are nearing the one million mark after “near exponential growth” saw global cases more than double in the past week.The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned of the approaching milestone as new cases reached almost every country and territory across the world.“As we enter the fourth month since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic I’m deeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection,” Tedros said.On Wednesday evening, Donald Trump warned of “difficult days” for the US, saying: “We are going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific.”He again questioned China’s reported numbers on the virus: “The numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side – and I am being nice when I say that – relative to what we witnessed and what was reported.”The comments followed a Bloomberg news story that said a classified US intelligence report had concluded that China had under-reported the total cases and deaths it had suffered. On Wednesday – the last day of available figures – China reported 82,361 confirmed cases and 3,316 deaths.Trump’s warning came as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly asked US defence agencies for 100,000 body bags, for use by civilian authorities. The White House has previously said deaths could reach 240,000.Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia had an obligation to provide healthcare to people who are sick and within our territorial waters, as the government began plans to fly doctors from a private company to at least seven cruise ships floating off the coast of eastern Australia.Approximately 8,500 crew, mostly foreigners, are on board the ships.The Chinese city of Shenzhen has banned the eating of dogs and cats as part of a wider clampdown on the wildlife trade since the emergence of the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. Scientists suspect the coronavirus passed to humans from animals. Some of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to a wildlife market in the central city of Wuhan, where bats, snakes, civets and other animals were sold. Authorities in the southern Chinese technology hub said the ban on eating dogs and cats would come into force on 1 May. “Dogs and cats as pets have established a much closer relationship with humans than all other animals, and banning the consumption of dogs and cats and other pets is a common practice in developed countries and in Hong Kong and Taiwan,” the city government said in an order posted on Wednesday. “This ban also responds to the demand and spirit of human civilization.” China’s top legislature said in late February it was banning the trade and consumption of wild animals. Provincial and city governments across the country have been moving to enforce the ruling but Shenzhen has been the most explicit about extending that ban to dogs and cats. Dogs, in particular, are eaten in several parts of Asia. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has joined Facebook, telling her online followers that she had done so to share messages about coronavirus.Posting online on what is apparently her first personal Facebook account, Suu Kyi said she was initially reluctant to use the site, but that her profile “was created in order to communicate with people faster and more efficiently related to Covid-19 challenges”.Almost half of the country’s 51 million people use Facebook, according to the company, and her profile has already gained more than 955,000 followers. Suu Kyi’s health messages will not, however, be accessible to many people living in conflict-torn areas of the country. The internet has been blocked since June in areas of Rakhine and Chin state, where there is intense fighting between the military and the Arakan Army, a rebel group that demands greater autonomy for the state’s ethnic Rakhine people. Numerous rights groups and international agencies have urged Myanmar to lift the restrictions, warning that communities must be allowed to access crucial information. This call was reiterated on Wednesday by 18 ambassadors to Myanmar, including the UK and US, who expressed deep concern “about the high level of fighting, casualties and civilian displacement occurring in Rakhine and Chin states, and the threat of further conflict in other areas.”They also echoed the UN secretary general’s call for a global ceasefire, so that countries can focus on tackling the pandemic. Israel’s health minister and his wife were diagnosed with coronavirus and are in isolation following guidelines, the health ministry said on Thursday. Yaakov Litzman, 71, an ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has appeared regularly alongside the premier to provide updates on the spread of the pandemic and new measures to combat it. But Litzman has scaled back public appearances in recent weeks and the ministry’s director-general has held daily briefings instead. Litzman and his wife feel well, the ministry said in a statement. Netanyahu tested negative for the virus on Monday after a parliamentary aide was confirmed to have it. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen to 73,522 while 872 people have died of the disease, statistics from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. Cases rose by 6,156 compared with the previous day while the death toll climbed by 140, the tally showed.Germany has the fifth-highest humber of cases worldwide, but a low death rate compared to other badly impacted countries. My colleague Philip Oltermann wrote about this last week: “Germany’s relatively low mortality rate continues to intrigue experts as Covid-19 spreads across Europe, with some questioning the methodology behind its data gathering while others argue the country’s high testing rates allow a more accurate approximation of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus.”Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has been widely criticised by labour groups after he ordered police to shoot dead residents who break quarantine rules. His violent threat follows the arrest of 21 people who had apparently taken to the streets of  Manila’s Quezon City to demand help from the government. Police said the group had protested without a permit, though the website Rapper reported that it is not clear if all residents were demonstrating or if some were simply looking for food.There is growing concern about how the poorest people in the Philippines will survive a month-long lockdown that has been imposed on the country’s main Luzon island. Many of its 48 million residents live hand-to-mouth and depend on daily work to feed their families. The government has promised that 18 million low-income households will receive support, but this has not been released due to administrative hurdles. On Wednesday night, Duterte told people to wait for assistance, adding: “Even if it’s delayed, it will arrive and you will not go hungry. You will not die of hunger.”Quarantine measures, he said, would be strictly enforced. “I will not hesitate. My orders are to the police and military, also the barangay, that if there is trouble or the situation arises that people fight and your lives are on the line, shoot them dead. Do you understand? Dead. Instead of causing trouble, I’ll send you to the grave,” he said in a televised address. Still with finance but a really good insight into how the virus is heaping costs on higher risk businesses such as the cruise ship operator Carnival. For more on the credit crunch facing companies, this is a piece I wrote a week or so agOFinancial markets are in a strange position at the moment. They have recovered some losses thanks to massive government and central bank intervention around the world, but the grim reality of what the virus is doing to economies continues to weigh on investor sentiment.The US dollar held gains against other currencies as people continue to shift their money into the greenback because it’s seen as a safe haven at a time when everything else is turning to custard.Trump’s warnings about tough days ahead are not helping here.This comment to Reuters from one expert, Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York, is quite chilling:. If America’s optimistic president is warning the worst of the pandemic is yet to come, what factory in their right mind would keep the doors open and workers on the payroll? With only a few actual data points so far, the results indicate this is looking more like a depression than a garden-variety recession.With 89 cases – including 76 positive cases and 13 probable – New Zealand has reported its highest daily rise so far, according to Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield. There are now almost 800 cases in the country. Indonesia may start a new holiday to replace the Eid exodus amid coronavirus concerns, Reuters reports. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday the government is considering starting a new national holiday to prevent the annual mass exodus usually occurring at the end of the Muslim fasting month amid concerns over the spread of Covid-19. South Korea will allow coronavirus patients to vote by mail or as an absentee in this month’s parliamentary elections, as campaigning started on Thursday, Reuters reports. Voters will go to the polls on 15 April to elect 300 members of the National Assembly for the next four years, posing challenges over how to prevent a spread of the coronavirus at polling places while ensuring people’s right to vote. The some 4,000 patients receiving treatment will be able to case their ballot via mail or early absentee voting, Interior Minister Chin Young said.  A two-week campaign period for the election began on Thursday with candidates wearing masks and shunning handshakes and large rallies. The National Election Commission has said all voters must wear a mask when they go to the polling stations, use sanitisers and gloves available there, and maintain distance with others. Officials will conduct temperature checks at the entrance and regular disinfection work. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 89 new cases on Thursday, taking the national tally to 9,976. A total of 5,828 have recovered from the virus, while 4,148 are still receiving treatment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4218340.1585774004!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"un climate summit in glasgow postponed until 2021","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson and Sir David Attenborough at February’s launch of the next COP26 UN Climate Summit at the Science Museum, London.  Photograph: Chris J RatcliffePA Wire A UN climate summit that had been due to take place in Glasgow in November has been postponed to 2021 because of the coronavirus outbreak, officials said on Wednesday.With the world currently on track for catastrophic temperature increases, the two-week summit had been supposed to galvanise renewed international commitment to an accord brokered in Paris in 2015 aimed at stabilising Earth’s climate.But with the British hosts and other countries struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought swathes of the global economy to a standstill, officials decided to push the summit back to give governments more time to prepare.Ending widespread speculation that the summit would be postponed, Finnish environment minister Krista Mikkonen said the climate summit and a separate summit on preserving threatened species, which had been due to take place in Kunming, China, in October, were both being pushed back to next year.“Glasgow’s COP26 climate conference will move from November to next year due to the global coronavirus situation,” Ms Mikkonen said in a statement, quoting UN climate officials.With financial markets also in turmoil, hopes that 2020 would prove a pivotal year for climate diplomacy and action to reverse accelerating extinctions of plant, animal and insect species have rapidly faded.Nevertheless, some investors, diplomats and campaigners welcomed the postponement, saying it could buy governments time to prepare a more successful outcome than might be possible in the face of a global pandemic and turmoil in financial markets. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Niall CarsonAFP via Getty ImagesBoth parties have already agreed in principle that the position of taoiseach should rotate between them in a coalition government of equals.It is also understood that they have agreed in principle on an equal split in ministerial jobs. It had been assumed that Mr Martin would be taoiseach first in any arrangement but a view has taken hold among some in Fine Gael that Mr Varadkar should remain in place to deal with the coronavirus crisis.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together have 72 Dáil seats, eight short of a majority, and Mr Varadkar has said a third party is needed, as well as some Independents.Although talks are continuing between the two Civil War parties, sources on both sides say there is still a long way to go until a government is formed.On whether he or Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin would be taoiseach first, Mr Varadkar on Wednesday said: “That is something that is under discussion with Fianna Fáil but they are a party with slightly more seats than us and we recognise that but really I do not think anyone’s focus at the moment is on what job they are going to hold in a few weeks’ time or a few months’ time.”Fianna Fáil have 37 seats and Fine Gael have 35, and Mr Varadkar’s comments could be seen as an acknowledgment that Mr Martin should be taoiseach first.The two parties are attempting to agree a framework document and hope to then approach other parties and Independents seeking support.Labour TDs this week reiterated its desire to go into opposition and the Social Democrats say their policies are not compatible with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. The Civil War parties have ruled out dealing with Sinn Féin.The Greens reiterated their position on Wednesday that they want to pursue a national unity government. However, it is understood there was a discussion at the Green parliamentary party about what to do if this fails.There were differing views within the group on whether to engage with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Internal debate is continuing and party sources said the Greens would likely examine any document produced by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.National effortNewly elected Fianna Fáil senator and former TD Malcolm Byrne said the party should avoid “rushing into government” on the “basis that we support the national effort right now”. Mr Byrne won a Dáil seat in the Wexford byelection but lost it in January’s general election.“For the next few weeks, we have to put politics aside and all work together. We will need a government in due course but Fianna Fáil must only go in on the basis of a clear policy platform discussed by the parliamentary party and membership setting out our agenda prior to any programme being agreed. Rushing formation and presenting a package as a fait accompli will be wrong.”‘Gentle admonishment’Meanwhile, the State’s most senior civil servant has issued the Oireachtas with what is being characterised as a “gentle admonishment” to TDs over the Dáil sitting on Thursday.Martin Fraser, secretary general of the Government, sent a letter to his counterpart in the Oireachtas, Peter Finnegan, which has been forwarded to TDs.Mr Fraser highlighted that “everyone in the country has been asked to stay at home, subject to the limited exceptions which have been published by the Government”.

Senator Maura Hopkins stood down for family reasons and Senator Catherine Noone is seeking re-election to the Industrial and Commercial panel. Ms Noone became embroiled in controversy over remarks she made and subsequently apologised for about the Taoiseach and autism.In a letter to TDs, Senators and councillors ahead of voting, Leo Varadkar asked voters “to consider gender balance in how you vote. If you are not giving at least four of your 10 first and second preferences to female candidates, there is something wrong.“We need more women in our parliamentary party to better reflect real Ireland and we need more women in the Seanad to meet the 40 per cent gender quota for the next Dáil election.“If we don’t have more female candidates there will be even fewer slots for male candidates next time out.”CriticismThe party had already faced criticism when former TD Kate O’Connell was not selected as a candidate. Her sister Mary Newman Julian was candidate on the Cultural and Educational panel but did not get elected.Former TD Áine Collins is seeking election to the same panel, as is Cllr Sharon Tolan in Co Meath and Linda O’Shea Farren, while Cllr Emer Currie from Mr Varadkar’s Dublin West constituency is a candidate on the Administrative panel, to be selected on Friday.Meanwhile, four of the outgoing Senators on the university panels have been re-elected. Senator Rónán Mullen topped the poll and was elected on the first count in the National University of Ireland (NUI) panel. He is the first Senator to be elected on the first count since 1989. Michael McDowell was elected on the ninth count.Third-placed Senator Alice Mary Higgins is in a race against fourth-placed former Solidarity TD Ruth Coppinger, but remained on course to retain her seat.In the Trinity College constituency Senator David Norris was retained after topping the poll and he was re-elected on the fifth count. His surplus secured the re-election of Senator Ivana Bacik.Rugby internationalSenator Lynn Ruane is in third and remained some 700 votes ahead of fourth-placed former Irish rugby international Hugo MacNeill.Meanwhile, more than half of the 43 Senators on the vocational panels have been elected and the first Traveller Senator, Eileen Flynn, was expected to be elected late on Wednesday night.At least eight former TDs will return to the Oireachtas, led by Ministers of State Michael D’Arcy and Seán Kyne.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"dolphins enjoy friendships lasting decades imitating study finds","story":"Dolphins enjoy friendships lasting decades by imitating each other\u0027s sounds and movements, an academic study has found.Male bottlenose dolphins match the tempo and timing of each other\u0027s calls, as well as synchronise their movements, when working together to shield a female they both want to mate with.The co-operative tactic can result in them forming long-lasting partnerships, as they simultaneously compete to fertilise the female while herding her away from other males, according to researchers.Bronte Moore, a coastal and marine scientist, says dolphins rely on synchronous movements to maintain their social bond and are able to form alliances that can last for decades.Apart from humans, very few animals use both verbal and physical synchronisation when working together.Researchers from the University of Western Australia (UWA) and the University of Bristol analysed acoustic data from a population of dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia.Dr Stephanie King, a senior lecturer from Bristol\u0027s School of Biological Sciences, said: Male dolphins need to work together to herd a female and defend her from rival alliances, but they are also competing to fertilise her.Such synchronous and co-ordinated behaviour between allied males may therefore promote co-operative behaviour and regulate stress, as it has been shown to do in humans.The study, which was funded by The Branco Weiss Fellowship - Society in Science, and the National Geographic Society, was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Comment: Britain has traded inidual liberty for a terrifying state omnishamblesNever mind Bond girls, Daniel Craig is the real sex object, says Lea SeydouxComment: Let’s stop dithering and fight this virusCoronavirus latest news: US sets new one-day record with 884 coronavirus deathsTokyo to keep schools shut over coronavirus amid fears Japan\u0026#39s health system will collapse Coronavirus cases in Birmingham and the Midlands, mappedCoronavirus cases in Scotland, mappedWhen will the UK lockdown end?

A carbolic spray makes the operation safe. Every one of the men hauling and cutting wear face foliage – beardage.Lister generally went in for the side-fuzz known from the 1850s as Dundreary whiskers, made fashionable by a character in the hit play Our American Cousin. (Abraham Lincoln was watching this farce when he was assassinated – surely another indication of the health and safety risks of facial hair.)Lister would have had something to chew on this week when doctors bravely volunteering to do what’s needed for coronavirus patients were handed shaving kits as they signed up. It’s because beards spoil the seal between masks known as FFP3 and the skin. Ordinarily, to expect shaving would be an outrageous example of everyday pogonophobia – a hate crime against beardies.Yet men who for 20 or 30 years had never seen their face in the mirror without the dignified covering of nature’s muffler have selflessly taken up scissors and razor. It is not to be underestimated. For men not afflicted with the facial fidgets – like David Beckham, who grows and mows facial designs as though he were using a Bazooka Joe instant tattoo transfer – beards are not just for Christmas. Martial figures, like the Cid of Spain, saw the beard as an emblem of honour touch it and you’d lose your head. That seems reasonable.And health chiefs are aware of the danger of religious discrimination in expecting beardlessness. Leaving the beard and hair uncut is kesh, one of the five Ks of Sikhism. Some Sikhs have preferred to die rather than cut their locks. Many Orthodox Jews recoil from the use of a razor, though, with the casuistry embraced by lovers of law, some allow an electric shaver as long as it acts as scissors would, and not like a razor edge.Peace to all such. I hope they find a way. My real gripe is with the widespread sprouting of stubble and careless beards through inertia. Just as it is no surprise now to glimpse an unmade bed behind a television talking head seen by Zoomery at home, so viewers are confronted with bristling patches of grey and ginger on talking chins. You can hear it rustle on the mike sometimes, like a cockroach in a bag of crisps.This matters because, after the Plague Year, the world will be remade, and the habits we’ve all picked up will determine how well it is refashioned. Some strive to insert the thin end of their ideology now, in order to make Britain more bossily state-controlled in future. But the unspoken ways of behaviour are the ones that really determine national culture.No one uses coins now for fear of germs. Will cash comes back? No one much dresses differently for work now, slopping about in tops and bottoms. Will smart dresses and suits return? This is the territory into which accidental beardism is thrusting its spring growth, like bindweed between the decking.I have a bearded dog in this fight. I last shaved my beard in 1976, after hearing an emotional performance of some Elgar. Little did I think, upon resuming its growth, that it could ever become fashionable. To see pogonotrophy creep on to a million chins by inadvertence is like leaving the carpets unvacuumed for the duration.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Dogs aren\u0027t necessarily deliberately hunting for birds, they bump into them and you can\u0027t take away the birds natural instinct to get away. If this happens continually they are away from their nests, the eggs chill and they are at more risk of predation.”  He said that skylarks, curlews, grey partridges, corn buntings stand to have a really good year this year.  This is because despite lockdown farmers are still doing their conservation projects.Fewer cars in the road means less roadkill, conservationists have said, meaning the lockdown could be a lifeline for hedgehogs, toads and other frequently-squashed creatures.Sue Patchett from the toad patrol in West Yorkshire told the Today Programme: Having the coronavirus, the lockdown, is going to have a massive effect on toad migration all up and down the country.   The main danger to toads is cars, but with coronavirus it should be so much easier for the toads to travel to their destinations. This year they will have a better chance of spawning.  Mr Swan agreed, adding  The less cars there are on the road the less wildlife road casualties there are for animals, hedgehogs and birds in particular get squashed on the road. Blackbirds, pheasants squabble at each other in the middle of the road and have no idea what the traffic is doing so they end up getting squashed.”  The closure of pubs and restaurants has meant a lessening demand for fish and seafood. Because of this, many fishing businesses are going out to sea less frequently or have paused operations for now.   The Marine Conservation Society said this could help our fish stocks recover.  A spokesperson told The : “It’s certainly feasible that some stocks could be subjected to reduced fishing pressure due to the drop in demand as a result of the pandemic, but whether or not that reduction is sustained long enough for populations to increase is hard to predict.  “There is no question that Covid-19 is upending the global seafood trade, supply chains and reducing demand on food-services such as eat-in restaurants.   “If we saw reduced fishing operations over the lockdown period due to Covid-19 and reduce catch volumes directly relating to this, this in turn could potentially impact some fish stocks status in the long run.”   The insects of Britain may be enjoying a brief respite from the tyranny of the trampling foot.  Matt Shardlow, the CEO of Buglife, said that oil-beetles on coastal footpaths are likely to do well as a result of the lockdown if fewer people are travelling to the coast for their walks.  He added, however, that he is concerned that movement restrictions mean conservationists will find it difficult to continue their work looking after endangered species, including reintroduction programmes. Mr Shardlow explained: “It is important that wherever restrictions allow we keep the work going that is enabling the continued survival of other species, and that enables us to assess the health of the countryside during this period.”Washing our hands more often may be hurting the invertebrates in our rivers, he added, explaining: “Anti-bacterial chemicals in handwashes can be persistent and harmful to the environment, an increase in the volume of anti-bacterial chemicals going through sewage works could harm river life.”  One bug which is likely to flourish this spring due to lockdown is the bumblebee.  The conservationist said:  “On the other-hand reduced economic activity will reduce air pollution, which will help bees find flowers – exhaust fumes disguise floral scents – and reduce the current damaging eutrophication of grasslands, wetlands, heathlands and woodlands.”   More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus parents should not overly worried children","story":"The death of a 13-year-old in Britain from coronavirus has understandably led to fears that the virus may not be so harmless for children as first thought.Up to now, youngsters have seemed largely immune from Covid-19, with most cases involving people over 60, or those with underlying health conditions.Yet teenager Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, from Brixton, south London, who died earlier this week, appears to have had no apparent health issues.So should parents be more worried?The latest number-crunching seems to suggest not. For the first time, scientists at Imperial College London have modelled the death rates for the virus by factoring in less serious cases that will never trouble the NHS. And it makes for illuminating reading.Looking at more than 70,000 cases in China, they discovered that, although the overall death rate for those testing positive was 1.3 per cent, or about one in 77 cases, once mild cases were included, the fatality rate fell dramatically to 0.66 per cent, or one in 152 cases.The same reduced risk holds true for all age ranges, and it means that the chance of dying for children contracting coronavirus is miniscule, approximately 0.0069 per cent for 10 to 29 year olds - or one in 14,492. For under-10s, there is even less risk, around 0.0016 per cent, or one in 62,500 (scroll down for chart featuring a full breakdown of risk by age range). Prof Azra Ghani of Imperial College said: There might be outlying cases that get a lot of media attention. But our analysis very clearly shows that at aged 50 and over, hospitalisation is much more likely than in those under 50, and a greater proportion of cases are likely to be fatal.”For people in their 20s, the death rate is still low - about one in 1,666, and even for the most at-risk group, new calculations suggest it is around one in 12, rather than one in seven.The new research shows that, for those in their 30s, the risk of death is around one in 1,190. For people in their 40s it\u0027s approximately one in 625, and for those in their 50s, it\u0027s one in 169. For people in their 60s, it rises to nearly one in 50. Over 70s have roughly a one in 23 risk of death.Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial said the British figures appeared to mirror China and were likely to be similar.As the UK epidemic unfolds, more data are becoming available, and at the moment the proportion of people in each age group most likely to require hospitalisation, and most likely to die from infection, are consistent with the estimates in this study, he said.It has been reported that Ismail suffered a cardiac arrest, and the case has been referred to the coroner. Experts said it may turn out that the youngster had an unknown underlying condition that made him more vulnerable.In recent years, several young and seemingly healthy sports stars have been found to have genetic conditions that put their hearts at risk.New research has shown that coronavirus causes a surge in inflammation, which can cause cardiac problems, and the authors warned that those with heart issues were at great risk.Dr Nathalie MacDermott, NIHR Academic Clinical Lecturer at King\u0027s College London, said: While it is reported this boy did not have any underlying conditions and was thought to be otherwise healthy, it is important that a coroner assesses whether a post-mortem is necessary to further understand the exact cause of death.While chronic underlying medical conditions are known to result in worse outcomes in Covid-19 infection, we have heard of cases of younger iniduals with no known medical problems succumbing to the disease.It is essential that we undertake research to determine why a proportion of deaths occur outside of the groups expected to succumb to infection as it may indicate an underlying genetic susceptibility of how the immune system interacts with the virus.While the figures do suggest that it is unlikely for the virus to strike the very young, experts warned that the latest case should remind parents that their children could still be at risk and they should continue to take precautions. Dr Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, said: This is a reminder that we must take the advice of health officials seriously to stay at home, wash hands, and keep well away from all other people. The message so far has seemed to be that by following the guidance, you might save the life of a cherished parent or grandparent. This case could yet remind us that staying home could also save the life of a cherished child or grandchild, too.Dr Vanessa Sancho-Shimizu, Research Fellow in the Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases \u0026amp Virology, Imperial College London, added: This is devastating news and our thoughts go out to the family. This highlights that however exceedingly rare this may be, statistics means nothing when it affects those close to you, and that there is no room for complacency in this pandemic.At the same time, this is an opportunity to understand what went wrong so that we can better understand the disease which can provide unprecedented insight into how we control infection.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus qa private test can get one","story":"With growing frustration at the Government’s failure to begin testing anyone other than front-line NHS staff and those already ill in hospital, people are looking for an alternative. As more key staff self-isolate, possibly unnecessarily, some are turning to mail order tests to get the all-clear.Several private clinics and laboratories offer home kits. Summerfield Healthcare offers one of the cheaper tests, from £199 to £299. The Private Harley Street Clinic sells a home test kit for £395 which also covers nine other respiratory viruses, including flu.Some have been accused of this, but they say the cost is driven by the rising price of components, delivery, packing and distribution. Dr Mark Ali, of the Private Harley Street Clinic in London, has taken orders for more than 7,000 tests at £375 each. He says he has donated 100 tests to the NHS and rejects the accusations of profiteering, saying he is offering a badly needed service.Summerfield Healthcare raised the price of its home delivery testing kits from £149 to £249, citing increased demand and supplier costs.Mail order services provide a throat and nasal swab, which are sent to a laboratory for analysis. Most tests are based on the detection of small amounts of genetic material specific to the virus, using a method called polymerase chain reaction. These can take several days to provide a result, although it is hoped that new technologies will speed this up.Alternatively, small proteins (antigens) can be detected which provide a rapid but less accurate answer.Several labs that offered private tests during the initial days of the outbreak are now starting to supply the NHS, creating a backlog for private users.AlphaBiolabs, Cheshire, said it had received hundreds of orders from employers to test their workers, “to keep supply chain businesses operational”, but that it had decided to supply all initial stock to the NHS at cost price.Results are promised within days of receipt of a sample, though in some cases customers are advised that the high volume of requests means there may be delays. Randox Laboratories in Co Antrim is understood to be increasing its capacity so it can process 5,000 tests a week.Public Health England advises against “rapid, at-home tests”, as there is “little information” on their accuracy or “suitability for diagnosing Covid-19 in a community setting”. It warns it is not known if either a positive or negative result from these tests is reliable. It has begun evaluating a number of commercial tests but has yet to approve any.There are also warnings that unlicensed and even unsafe tests could flood the market as fraudsters cash in.Many employers are understood to be cautious of them, given the questions over reliability and risk of a “cleared” member of staff passing it on. Edwin Morgan, of the Institute of Directors, says: “PHE hasn’t been advocating the use of home testing kits, and directors will be taking their lead from official guidance. Employers have a duty of care and will also be trying to be as responsible as they can to help prevent the spread of the virus. Inevitably there will be grey areas, and companies will have to make what they consider to be the best decision in these very difficult circumstances.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/01/TELEMMGLPICT000228423911_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqtkFNGfLQhkpVPeNfby9bQSy0D0hOUEQyLH9a5yxWECY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"even pandemic expert like life isolation has struggle","story":"Being told to self-isolate upset me more than I ever thought it would – but thankfully I\u0027m beginning to see the upsidesI love my job. For 10 years I have worked at Public Health England (PHE) and its predecessor, the Health Protection Agency, responding to major public health emergencies including the ebola outbreak and the Novichok poisoning. There is nothing more fascinating than taking scientific advice, converting it into practical action, and encouraging the public to understand and support that action.Last year I stepped down as the medical director of PHE after concluding that, with an incurable cancer diagnosed two years before, I could no longer do justice to the intensity of work needed during major national incidents such as coronavirus. Nevertheless, I feel privileged to be involved still through an emeritus role and able to help wherever I can as the nation responds to the present crisis. A week into March, I managed to take a long-planned break with my wife in the Canaries. We arrived home, despite disrupted flights, just as Spain was going into lockdown and I was looking forward to rejoining the response effort. The very next day it was announced, based on PHE advice, that older and vulnerable people with diseases such as mine should largely stay at home for 12 weeks and limit any contact with those who do not live in the same household.The strength of my reaction caught me by surprise – I was deeply upset. I have always considered myself fit and healthy. My way of responding to having an incurable cancer with a much-reduced life expectancy has largely been to keep calm and carry on. To live life as normally as possible, including working, staying as physically active and mentally positive as I can, and spending time with those important to me, especially my family. Suddenly this was no longer possible. I could work but only from home (back then, everyone else was still travelling in to work), our children could no longer come to visit and the positive mental mindset took a quick, though mostly temporary, nosee. None of this was because the cancer had progressed again. Rather it was to lower my risk of getting coronavirus, even though my preference was to continue more normally and accept the increased risk. More than anything I am a trained doctor and I really wanted to play my part in dealing with this pandemic. I wondered what had happened to shared decision making and patient autonomy.After a few hours of festering, I began to think more rationally. I remembered the pandemic exercises showing that, without social distancing, many more people are infected, the NHS is unable to treat all of those in need and many more patients die as a result. I thought back, too, on a message I had tried to get across in media interviews: that we are all in this together. We all have a part to play and that includes being prepared to comply with advice on social distancing. Clearly this is a time to act collectively. We do have a stark choice. If we can make social distancing work, we should see the peak of this pandemic in a small number of weeks. We will have supported the NHS, and many fewer lives will be lost. My part in that is to contribute what I can from home, not become another person needing NHS care, possibly with ventilation.There are some up sides. My use of social media to stay in touch with my family has improved no end, as has my ability to work from home. With the phone and internet, I can still use some of my skills as a trained doctor. At a personal level I finally decided to have a procedure that enables me to manage my cancer more at home and avoid some trips to hospital. This has helped to keep my lungs inflated – making me less likely to get complications if I do get coronavirus – and my ability to exercise is improving again. Saving the time spent getting to work and travelling between meetings is liberating.It is easier to find the upsides now that most people are working in the same way – I no longer feel singled out as one of the “vulnerable”. I am, of course, really looking forward to the pubs, restaurants and cinemas opening again, to travelling and to many other things getting back to normal. But in the meantime, it really is possible to “keep calm and carry on”. And, come what may, I will do my part. Prof Paul Cosford is emeritus medical director at Public Health England The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

We absolutely want to avoid that.Police-enforced restrictions on movement mean people can only leave their house to exercise, shop for essential items or go to work if they cannot work from home.Lord King said it was unrealistic to think the lockdown could continue for months and months on end and called for a gradual exit strategy to protect the economy and citizens\u0027 well-being.Data released from the Department of Transport – illustrated in the above graph – showed that after consistently dropping from March 23, when the lockdown was announced, the number of people travelling on buses and Tubes in London rose slightly on March 30.The numbers of those using their cars and vans rose by 10 per cent on the same day, from 27 per cent of normal levels on the Sunday to 37 per cent on Monday.Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, described the uptick in motor vehicle traffic as a slightly concerning trend.Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science which advises the Government, said people going to work still make up around 30 per cent of the trips outside the home.Describing the figure as quite a concern, she said that one group of people who are still working is the five million self-employed who will not receive any money until June under support measures announced by the Chancellor last week.A lot of them, because of their circumstances, will carry on working – they have families to feed and they have no money coming in and that is a really urgent issue,” Prof Michie told The .She also raised concerns that a lot of people were going to workplaces where social distancing measures of keeping two metres apart were not being enforced.Prof Michie said the Government now needs to get on the front foot and incentivise people to stay at home. We are only a week in and it is important to think about the problems that are likely to start as time goes on, she said. There are financial and practical pressures, issues of boredom, frustration, depression and for people living on their own, loneliness. Those things increase over time, and even more so for people in financially insecure circumstances.She said that as time goes on people might lose the motivation to stay indoors and as the weather gets better more and more people will want to be outside.Professor John Ashton, former president of the Faculty of Public Health, said compliance with the lockdown is dependent on trust and trust in the Government is fairly low because they have failed to be open and transparent from the beginning.I said from the outset that they need to take the public with them, but they were treating people like children, Prof Ashton said. If you want people to behave like adults then you have to treat them like adults and then they will play their part.He said that among the failures in the Government response to the pandemic has been a failure to be honest about testing capability and personal protective equipment and a failure to share data even among medical professionals.I think it is a danger that the lockdown might not stick, he added.Prof Ashton said that one way in which the Government could help enforce the measures was to roll out testing which would allow the restrictions to be altered according to need.However, the authorities on Wednesday night insisted that the vast majority of people are complying with the rules. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van Tam said: I know how incredibly disruptive this has been for people across the country, but these measures are essential to help support the NHS.Whatever the weather, we all have a shared responsibility to protect those around us, and the single most important action we can all take in fighting coronavirus is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives.A Government spokesman said: Our message is clear – people should stay at home. This will save lives, protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. The restrictive measures the PM announced last week remain in place. Police across the UK have the powers they need to enforce these where necessary.A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said that they had seen an overwhelming response to the lockdown measures last weekend and are hopeful that the public will continue to abide by the rules this weekend.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia sends planeload medical supplies us","story":"A Russia military plane carrying medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) is en route to the United States after the Kremlin confirmed that United States President Donald Trump accepted Moscow’s offer of help.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said late on Tuesday that Mr Trump accepted with gratitude this aid of humanitarian nature  in a phone call with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. The US is grappling with the coronavirus epidemic, the total number of cases climbing to 189,000 by Tuesday.The Kremlin expects that the US would be in a position to offer aid to Russia as well at some point when US medical supplies producers raise their output volumes, Mr Peskov said.Mr Trump made a passing reference to Russian aid during a press conference on Monday, saying that Russia sent us a very, very large planeload of things.Reports of the US administration accepting aid from Russia have caused concerns that Moscow could be using the coronavirus crisis to at least get the US to ease some of the sanctions that have been imposed on Russia for its annexation of Ukraine\u0027s Crimea, its involvement in a separatist conflict in Ukraine as well as meddling in the 2016 US elections.Details of the Russian shipment remained unclear, however.Footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry showed a military plane full of cardboard boxes taking off from an airfield outside Moscow late on Tuesday night.The Russian military sent several planes with medical supplies and doctors to Italy last month. The Russians did not specify the contents of the shipments but Italian media reported that local authorities found most of them to be useless.Government critics in Russia have accused President Putin of putting his global ambitions before the country\u0027s well-being.Our regions are short of the most basic necessities, they’re running low even on face masks, opposition leader Lyubov Sobol tweeted. Putin lives in a fairy-tale world and plays his geopolitical games as the situation gets worse every day.Russia had 2,777 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Wednesday morning, with 24 deaths.Doctors across Russia have complained about a lack of PPE, and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said earlier this week that the city could soon run out of protective suits.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden finally closes ski resorts tells elderly stay home","story":"Sweden\u0027s government has closed all ski resorts and advised the elderly to stay at home to limit the spread of coronavirus after facing criticism for its slow response to the crisis. The government has called on citizens to avoid travelling in rush hour and visiting relatives over Easter, and advised the elderly to stay away from shops.The new guidelines also included a recommendation not to hold sporting competitions such as football matches, and followed moves to close ski resorts across the country. The country\u0027s health minister, Lena Hallengren, said: Over Easter, stay home. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of that. No unnecessary journeys. The tougher recommendations come after the total number of deaths from coronavirus in Sweden tripled to 239 in just three days, putting growing pressure on the authorities to act.Sweden\u0027s government has faced growing criticism, both internationally and at home, for its approach to slowing the spread of coronavirus, with schools, bars and restaurants still remaining open.  The government has so far only banned events of more than 50 people, while only universities and upper secondary schools have shifted to distance learning.Sweden\u0027s state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, the figurehead of the country\u0027s coronavirus strategy, conceded at his daily press conference that the number of people being admitted to hospital had started to increase.If you look over the recent month we have had a relatively flat curve, but now we are seeing a pretty steep increase, he said. He said Finland and Norway, where the number of deaths had been fewer, were simply at different phases of the pandemic.We shall see how it ends up, but there are explanations as to why they look as they do, he added.The Public Health Authority announced on Tuesday that it was putting together an advisory group of epidemiological and clinical experts it could draw on, raising the possibility that Mr Tegnell may begin to be sidelined.  On Tuesday evening, Skistar and Branäs group, Sweden\u0027s two biggest ski resort operators, announced that their slopes would close next week.  Stefan Sjöstrand, Skistar\u0027s chief executive, told The  he had made the decision following a call with Mr Carlson. Since the past weekend, there has been a clear increase in the number of people who have been taken into intensive treatment in the big hospitals, he said.  Yesterday, when we were in contact regarding these new facts, it was very clear to us that the healthcare system would not manage to take care of people coming into our resorts during the Easter peak season.He contrasted Sweden\u0027s power to the people approach, where iniduals and businesses are trusted to act responsibly, to those of Austria, Norway and Switzerland, where the governments have ordered ski resorts to close.Dr Sofia Leje, who heads the primary care ision in the ski town of Åre, had long been calling for local resorts to close after infections brought by incoming skiers took the per capita number of coronavirus cases in her region close to that of Stockholm.I am extremely worried, she told SVT in mid-March. I think it\u0027s important that we learn from other ski resorts in Europe, which have been hit really hard in Italy and Austria, and from where infections have spread elsewhere.But Mr Tegnell had repeatedly argued that the resort companies\u0027 moves to limit aprés-ski events and reduce queues were sufficient to minimise the spread of infections. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"free paper delivery 12 weeks","story":"This means no one has to miss out on their favourite daily read.Simply head online to delivermynewspaper then search your postcode and choose your local newsagent.Select “The Sun” and let us know how often you would like to receive your newspaper.Finally, fill in your details and click “Send My Vouchers”.Vouchers for  weeks of free delivery will be posted to your address.Take these vouchers with you to your chosen newsagent to claim your free -week delivery.Alternatively, you can get your free delivery vouchers by calling us directly on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My body ached severely, I felt so heavy and was sweating with a fever.Things were not looking good. I struggled to sleep due to the intense body aches – I never felt anything like this before.Doctors have warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, has said that those who lose these senses should self-isolate immediately - evenyou have no other symptoms.They added that the eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.In a statement, the docs said: Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas.We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus.Its thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.Ryan Van Waterschoot, who ended up in hospital for  days while he fought Covid-, is one of those who lost his sense of taste and smell.The -year-old said: I didn’t think I was going to make it out of the hospital. I thought it was the end of the road for me.Mr Van Waterschoot, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, first felt unwell on March  when he lost his sense of taste and smell and, and went from feeling tired to not being able to move in just one day.As his condition worsened, he called the doctors and was immediately advised to call an ambulance on March .His temperature had soared and he was taken to Peterborough City Hospital where he was put on an isolation ward and needed oxygen for five days.He is now at home recovering but has warned people to stay at home and follow government advice.Some people may experience brain fog, also known as mental fatigue, as another symptom of coronavirus.Its not been officially looked into as a symptom but its another indicator that those who have experienced the illness have reported experiencing.Thea Jourdan, , said she didnt experience a cough or fever - instead her introduction to Covid- began with a tickle in her throat and a dull headache,.The mum-of-three, from Hampshire, says she then started to experience brain fog.She told the Daily Mail: Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever.But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep.Another woman, who had recently recovered from Covid-, told the Huffington Post that she too had experienced the unusual mental block before her symptoms worsened.Christy, from Seattle, said her illness started with a multi-day fever that progressed into sinus congestion, a headache and a debilitating “brain fog” that made it impossible to focus.She added: “It’s not just a cold.  I’m pretty healthy and not old , and it kicked my a**.”Another symptom that coronavirus patients have reported is feeling extremely fatigued before symptoms develop.According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to  per cent of those hospitalised with Covid- reported exhaustion and fatigue.Chiara DiGiallorenzo, , has been battling Covid- since March , said her illness started with a fever and fatigue.But she knew it was more serious than a flu when she developed a tightness in her chest that left her short of breath.Chiara, from Miami, told HuffPo: “It is not the flu,” adding that many people who get it are left “fighting for air.”Linda Carr, , from Hethersett, Norfolk, said that around a fortnight ago she lost her sense of taste and smell.She told the Mail she then developed other symptoms, adding: I felt very sick and terribly fatigued. But I didn’t have a temperature or a cough.Within two days I could barely stand. I didn’t have the energy to lt one foot in front of the other.It was only when she went to her GP to collect some unrelated blood tests that she had her temperature taken and was told it was so high she should go straight to hospital.She tested positive for Covid- and spent five days in hospital before being discharged.Linda says she is still feeling weak and remains in isolation at home.Those who develop minor symptoms such as a high temperature or continuous cough should self-isolate for seven days.If you live with others, you should also stay at home for  days from the day the first person started showing symptoms.Anyone with suspected coronavirus who becomes seriously ill should call  and in a medical emergency always call .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Results can take between a few hours to a couple of days to come back.The second test is the much-awaited antibody test - hailed a game-changer.The test is a finger-prick test and is being designed to be performed at home, giving results almost instantly like a pregnancy test.It detects antibodies that the immune system produces to fight coronavirus so can tellyou have had the bug, and are immune.These tests would give the green light for NHS staff, key workers and the public to go back to work, and could help relax lockdown measures.Testing for coronavirus serves a number of important purposes.The swab test can tell us how many people currently have Covid-.Meanwhile, the antibody test can tell us how many people in the population have had it.It can also give an idea of the asymptomatic population - how many people have had coronavirus, but have shown no symptoms.Knowing whos had the bug and who hasnt will drastically speed up our route out of lockdown.It will allow us to identy who is safe to go back to work, and in some countries like Germany there are plans to give people certicates to identy they are safe to move about.Labour deputy leadership candidate and AE doctor, Rosena Allin-Khan, who has gone back to work on the NHS front line, said another important aspect is staff wellbeing.She wrote to Matt Hancock telling him the lack of testing is having a huge mental health impact on our NHS workforce.Meanwhile, ex-health secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed his concern over the lack of mass testing, branding it very worrying.He said it had been key to finally controlling the outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic originated in December.Yesterday, Department of Health figures showed , people had been tested for coronavirus, in the previous  hours.That falls short of the Governments promise to test  , people a day.Last night, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said we have capacity to test , people.Meanwhile, the PM has expressed his desire to reach , tests a day.Today, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told hospitals to test more of their workforce, lting the restriction that trusts could only use  per cent of their capacity to test staff. The remaining  per cent was reserved for testing patients.In the UK around , people are being tested every day.In total since the start of the outbreak , people have been tested, with , testing positive.Meanwhile, in Germany, , tests are carried out each day - thats more than half a million a week.In total, South Korea has tested around , people since the start of the outbreak.Both countries have far fewer deaths than the UK.Testing for viruses is not a simple process.It requires the right equipment, testing conditions and as the Governments top doctor keeps reminding us, one thing worse that no test, is a bad test.But critics have pointed out, this crisis has been building since the start of the year, accusing the authorities of acting too late.Tim Colbourn, associate professor of global health epidemiology at University College London, said: The UK was complacent and didnt think it could happen here.We didnt see the signs quickly.Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, said part of the blame rests with Public Health England.He told Radio s Today programme: We have  molecular virology labs in the UK.If they were doing  tests a day, we would be up to Germany levels of testing and that is perfectly feasible.Public Health England were slow and controlled and only allowed non-PHE labs to start testing two weeks ago, but that was after the strategy to sht to end community tests.Prof Costello is referring to the announcement on March  to stop testing people in the community, as the Government announced a move from containment to delay in their plan to tackle the outbreak.From that point, only people in hospital have been tested for Covid-.The Government has repeatedly said their goal is to increase testing capacity across the UK.Boris Johnson has said he wants to reach , a day, while Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said at yesterdays daily briefing we have capacity to carry out , tests.Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, said the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, are in talks with pharmaceutical companies across the world, after admitting a shortage of chemicals is partly to blame.The chemicals are needed for the antigen tests - or nasal swab tests currently being used to test NHS staff and patients.Mr Gove said last night that the Government must go further, faster to increase testing.We are increasing the number of tests, he said.One of the constraints on our capacity to increase testing overall is supply of the specic reagents, the specic chemicals, that are needed in order to make sure that tests are reliable.When asked when the Government started placing orders for key test parts, the PMs spokesman said today: Weve been working with industry throughout.But as the Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Chief Medical Officer have both set out, there is a global demand for reagents.Its clear from industry that they are working as hard as they can in order to support the NHS, and we are working alongside them.The chemical reagents the Government admits the UK is short of are needed for the nasal swab tests - the antigen test.Dr Colin Butter, at the University of Lincoln, explained there are two main bits to the chemistry.Many companies make suitable kits for this, he said. Universities and others will have lots on the shelves.The next step involves ingredients and chemicals to run the test itself.Prof Lawrence Young from the University of Warwick explained:  The test is complicated, and requires many dferent synthetic components which probably accounts for the shortages given the unprecedented demand.In recent days, theres been a lot of talk about the two dferent types of tests that the government are ramping up.The government refers to them as the have you got it antigen test or the have you had it antibody test.Here we explain the dference between the two...What is an antigen test Antigens are found on the surface of invading pathogens, including coronavirus.Testing for antigens can determine whether someone is currently carrying the virus and are actively infectious.The NHS is currently using antigen tests in hospitals to determinesomeone is currently infected with Covid-.Samples are taken using a swab - which resemble a large cotton bud - from deep inside the nose and throat before being sent off to a lab for testing.Most labs use a method called the polymerase chain reaction , which takes several hours to get a result.It can take days for labs to run the tests and tell people their result.Several companies are working on ways to fast track this type of testing.What is an antibody test When a person gets infected with antigen, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies in response - as a way to fight the infection.After they recover, those antibodies float in the blood for months, maybe even years.Thats the bodys way of defending itself in case it becomes infected with the virus again.So an antibody test specically looks for antibodies which will be able to tell whether youve already been exposed to Covid-.Anyone who has already had the illness is presumed to be immune to getting it again - at least, in the intermediate term.This would allow them to go back to work safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely to become infected again or pass the virus on.The check that has been developed for Covid- is a finger-prick blood test, with the samples sent to laboratories and results available within a few days.Dr Hilary Jones, a GP and resident doctor on Good Morning Britain, explained that it works almost like a pregnancy test, except you need a drop of blood.These tests are being developed by several dferent firms and Public Health Englandis also working on its own test.They still need to be validated to ensure they give accurate results.Dr Al Edwards at the University of Readings School of Pharmacy added that there are a lot of ingredients that go into a swab test.Any of these might be hard to get hold of in the current rush, he said. The world is seeing more of these virus tests conducted than ever before.But they could also be simply the swabs or containers for collecting samples.“The real catch is – we are very good at making a highly accurate test fast.But to make that test accurate, you need to keep the ingredients fixed. So we are likely seeing a shortage of the exact ingredients used in the approved tests.Although other versions might work it’s not easy to simply switch to a dferent type.There can be tiny changes that make the test fail – for example,you use the wrong swab to take the sample, the virus might not be detected.Professor Stephen Baker, an expert in molecular microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said: There is a massive demand for raw materials, this is not unique to the UK and many places no longer have stock of essential reagents.The Chemical Industries Association told The Times that demand for key chemicals is increasing.But it said reagents are being made and they are being delivered to the NHS.It said: Every business here in the UK and globally is looking at what they can do to help meet the demand as a matter of urgency.To clary the exact NHS  need and meet it, all relevant UK industries are continuing to work closely with the Government.The first hint of the coronavirus pandemic emerged at the end of December in China.While few countries could have predicted its rapid spread, some, including South Korea were better prepared.The nation had vast stocks of face masks and testing kids on standby, making them better placed to cope.Having endured the  Sars epidemic and the more recent Mers outbreak, South Korea built up huge stockpiles and had signicant testing capacity ready and waiting.Germany, which is testing , patients a week and has plans to test , a day, was quick to learn from the response of countries in Asia and began ramping up testing at an early stage.Professor Lawrence Young, from Warwick University, said countries like Germany also benefit from a more joined up approach.A better relationship with the biotech industry, more German virologists producing tests in January and central coordination by the Robert Koch Institute all gave Germany a head start, he said.When asked why this was such a challenge for the UK, he added: It just requires better national coordination.It highlights a lack of investment in virology over many years.Professor Stephen Baker, of Cambridge Uni, said there is no overnight solution.He warned: There are multiple steps to ensure that the methods used and results that are a correctly validated, as there is nothing more dangerous at the moment than reporting incorrect negative or positive results to staff or patients.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I even have iodine tablets.See  I chose THE WRONG BLOODY APOCALYPSE.I thought it was going to be nuclear bombs raining down on us. And I was well ready.But when the Four Horsemen eventually turned up, it wasn’t with nukes. It was with a bit of a bad cough.What I needed wasn’t a Geiger counter, but a ventilator. And paracetamol. How was I to know Probably because I was a Cold War kid and that’s how we all expected to go back then.Anyway, I might put my Geiger counter on Ebay.I’m asking £ or six rolls of toilet paper and some tinned tomatoes. And a Twix.And so here, in week two of the Great Lockdown, I’m pretty much useless.Unless you want to know the proportions of lead and concrete needed to minimise the radioactive fallout from a ten-megaton blast.One thing is bothering me, however.And that’s the Old Bill getting a bit overzealous in pursuit of people. Ordinary people going for a walk.A friend of mine was walking her dog in a London park when two rozzers turned up on horseback.They told her not to throw a ball for the dog.Why not  Because it might have Covid- on its fur and bump into someone .Um . . . might not the police horses also have Covid- on their fur And then there’s the Derbyshire coppers sending a drone to harass some bloke out for a walk in the Peak District. Entirely alone, not a danger to anyone.The chief plod of Derbyshire has been defending his force’s actions.Meanwhile, other forces have been naming and shaming the alleged “covidiots” on social media.I don’t think the Old Bill have ever been happier. They’re loving this.I know we must not take unnecessary journeys.I know we need to employ social distancing.People holding house parties and so on is crazy.I think the vast majority of us grasp this.But this is a tricky time. The public needs to be kept onside.We need to be able to respect our police, just as we respect the Government’s advice.Overzealous behaviour by the coppers does not help.Why should a bloke not swig from a can of beer in a park How is that more dangerous than taking your dog for a walk Why is being totally alone in a wilderness area a danger to other people There needs to be some common sense employed.Meanwhile, regarding my Geiger counter, the batteries are included.And for an extra roll of bog paper I’ll throw in the full-colour chart showing the ious symptoms of radiation poisoning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.THE wildle is just loving this lockdown, though.I’ve never seen so many foxes, badgers and deer out where I live.It’s because people aren’t going out.And I like the thought that the animals are always there, just waiting for us humans to come a cropper.I also enjoyed the patrol of goats which have taken over the Welsh resort of Llandudno.Watch your backs, you goats.MIDDLE CLASS: Sacking the nanny and the cleaner in case they give the virus to Cressida, two, and Wolfgang, four.Growing hydroponic vegetables in the annex, enough for half a salad by next Feb.Writing letters of complaint to the board of Waitrose about the unavailability of dried black limes and manchego.Stockpiling hummus.Cycling round the local park wearing chemical warfare gear.Trying, desperately, to sell their three-bedroom cottage in North East Italy.Washing their hands every  seconds with Duchy Original Organic Fairtrade Hand Sanitiser.Trying to fit a face mask on Corbyn, their Labrador.Removing the back seats from the Range Rover for the next click and collect.Hoping to get a nice postcard from their oldest son, Oliver, who has been on his gap year in Wuhan.WORKING CLASS: Getting p***ed watching Netflix.ONE of the surprising benefactors of this virus has been the BBC.Only a couple of months ago its very existence was in doubt.The Government was planning to decriminalise non-payment of its licence fee.People were sick to the back teeth of its patent political bias.But in general, it’s done very well during this crisis.Some of its news programmes have adapted brilliantly.Not Newsnight, obvs, which is still a jabbering gripefest.But the Radio Four PM programme has been excellent.It’s presenter, Evan Davis, has an affable calmness – and he asks the right questions.Radio Five has adapted well, too – although I’d junk ALL of the sport right now.Butonly the BBC could cover politics with the same lack of bias it is now using to cover the pandemic.I SAW that a bully Builder Who Shot His Partner, Their Two Daughters, Four and Two, Their Pet Dog and Then Himself At Their £, Sussex home was described as “a nasty Piece Of Work” by a Neighbour.Sheesh!

Bottoms up!WE have never really been as clever at shouting about our national drink as the French have about plonk.But brewing is actually a much more sophisticated process than winemaking, which leads to beer containing more flavour components than wine does.It also has the added advantage that you could live off it – at a push.It’s got just about everything you need – although you might want to throw in the odd bag of crisps for energy and pork scratchings for fat and, er, vitamins.The key with making beer at home is sanitising all your equipment, but basically you’re looking at the following procedure.CIDER is the easiest drink to make of all and my absolute favourite.There are countless dferent recipes but all you really need is apples.You can’t go wrong because the juice ferments all on its own through naturally occurring yeasts on the apple skins and in the air.Orchards are enchanting places.The apple trees on my farm are just coming in to blossom, traditionally the signal that the cider from last year’s apple crop is ready.Butyou can get your hands on apples, you can start whenever you like – and as long as everything is scrupulously clean it is drinkable at all stages of the fermentation process.I really like it at about two weeks, when it’s just starting to go fizzy but before the alcohol has had time to develop. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dr Hilary Jones – Health Editor for ITV’s Good Morning Britain – has been answering your questions which have been pouring in to The Sun in their thousands.Today, EMMA PIETRAS brings you the much-respected doctor’s answers to our readers’ dilemmas – on how to help care for their loved ones at the same time as safeguarding their own health.Q. Is it safe to travel from Surrey into London to take care of my grandchildren while my daughter gives birth in hospital A. Somebody has to look after the grandchildren butyou are over  or have a pre-existing medical condition, your daughter should really try to find someone she is only expected to stay in hospital for a few hours for the birth.Butthere really is no one , you can consider this an essential journey, as your grandchildren need care.Q. I am asthmatic and my partner is type- diabetic. Which of us is at greater risk  We have to do the shopping ourselves, as there are never delivery slots available with any supermarkets.A. Your conditions put both of you in the vulnerable group with an equal risk of greater consequences should you come down with the virus.While you need to stay at home as much as possible and to physically distance yourself from other people, it is all right for either of you to get essential supplies from the supermarket — as infrequently as possible.Q. Can you catch the virus from takeaway food A. Cooking food would kill the virus easily.So it all depends on how the food is put into any packaging and how effectively personal hygiene is being practised by the restaurant staff.If the take-away is in packaging, remove the food, discard the packaging and wash your hands before eating.Q. I’m in my eighties and can’t do the jobs I used to do around the home. Am I safe to call a tradesman to do the work A. For non-emergency work, please wait before you allow any tradesmen into your home.Any one of them could unwittingly bring the virus into your home, with potentially disastrous consequences.However,you have a flood from a leaking pipe or you smell gas from the boiler, that is dferent and would take priority — although you must still physically distance yourself from whoever helps you.Q. My house is joined on to a funeral director’s and I’ve noticed the staff wearing face masks. Should I be worriedthey are dealing with coronavirus victims A. If they are not already dealing with coronavirus victims, they may well be soon.Funeral directors are doing a wonderful job despite a shortage of proper personal protective equipment, and are dealing with bereaved people whose arrangements for their loved ones’ funerals have been severely disrupted.However, the virus cannot affect you living next door — although you should, of course, physically distance yourself from the staff when talking to them.Q. My husband, who is , has an appointment next week at the hospital to have an injection for macular degeneration. Is this safe A. Check with the hospital whether this appointment is going ahead.The treatment is designed to help save people’s sight but many such procedures are being postponed during the current emergency.The clinic may well say that it is up to your husband, in which case, you will need to make a decision based on how severe his eye condition is and how quickly it is progressing.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It just cares about creating doubt and anxiety.Times of crisis are times of anxiety and it is easier to explain the appearance of an aberration like SARS-CoV- as the result of an act of deliberation or incompetence of a laboratory than it is to admit to the fact that nature and evolution. Coronavirus has now infected at least close to a million people worldwide and killed , since the outbreak began in December.But Covid- conspiracy theories are spreading just as fast Some online crackpots have claimed the virus is the work of the US military, while other wacky webizens allege the outbreak is a hoax designed to stop Brexit.Others allege the disease is a plot by US spies to tank Chinas economy.Chinas state-run Global Times has reported that Chinese internet users and experts are calling for more information on whether The Fort Detrick laboratory was linked to the disease.It cited coincidental events between the outbreak and the closure of the CIA lab.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The think tank said a family who saved £, for a house deposit would miss out on £, of support a month, and chew through  half their deposit over six months. The Foundation also called for more advance payments to go to those who need them faster and weekly statistics on claims. Senior economist Karl Handscomb said: “The Chancellor has already announced a £ billion plan to make the system more generous. The key challenge now is to encourage more people to claim UC, process those claims rapidly, and get payments out to people as soon as possible. “The roll-out of Universal Credit in recent years has been beset by controversy.

Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey is asking Ministers to give councils new emergency powers to help the country fight the coronavirus crisis.Mr Healey says an overhaul of existing powers would allow councils to quickly take over empty housing on a temporary basis while the country battles covid-. This would allow those in badly overcrowded accommodation to have somewhere suitable when they’re ill or have to self-isolate. The measures could also be used to help those who are homeless. Mr Healey told the Mirror: “A secure and stable home for everyone has never been more important. People can’t effectively self-isolate and get betterthey are homeless or in badly overcrowded housing. “These emergency measures would give councils the powers to ensure that people in their area has a settled home throughout this crisis period and help control the spread of the virus. “Ministers should urgently update the rules to allow councils to bring empty properties into use, to help the country fight the coronavirus crisis.” Labour analysis of the Government’s English Housing Survey has identied , vulnerable people living in overcrowded housing, making it dficult to self-isolatethey or a member of their household gets ill. Government figures also suggest that there are now , homeless households in temporary accommodation, including in hostel-style bed and breakfast accommodation, often sharing kitchens or bathrooms with strangers. Recent reports suggest that a number of these households who are housed in hotels have been made homeless as major hotel chains shut their doors.

With Britain under lockdown, even celebs such as Amanda Holden and Chris Evans have been hosting radio shows from their living rooms. I’ve been working from home for  years, so I know just how tempting it is to stay in pyjamas and watch Netflix. But it is possible to be productive – you just need a few ground rules. Time keeper Agree with yourself what hours you’re going to work and stick to them. Starting early ensures ­productivity. Trust me, turning on your laptop at pm leads to knocking off at .pm. Work smart Treat the day asyou’re going to work – which means getting dressed. I’m not talking about a suit, but do wear clean, smart clothes because it will lt your mood. Create a workspace You need to create a designated workspace for office hours – be that in the kitchen or a corner of the living room. Going to this space will trigger “work mode” in your mind and help you settle into your day. Don’t work in bed. Besides being really bad for your back, bed is for relaxing and you’ll soon find yourself watching cat videos on YouTube. Mute the pings Turn off phone and email notications when you’re focusing on a task. According to a University of ­Calornia Irvine study, it takes an average of  minutes to refocus on a task once interrupted. Depending on your job, you probably only need to check your emails every few hours: morning, lunch, afternoon and before you shut up shop. Computer says no At home, there’s no IT department to save you. Buy an external hard-drive for your laptop or PC. Set it up to automatically update every hour. Email important work to yourself as a second back-up. Have a designated email address for this purpose.  Set boundaries I have two distractions at home – a small dog and a noisy partner . Both of them know when I’m working because I ask them to be quiet. Incidentally, the dog takes more notice. Getting peace and quiet when you have children at home can be more challenging, so be realistic and ask for short periods with no interruptions. Take a break According to research carried out by Hard Medical School, the most productive way to work is to concentrate for around  minutes, then have a break of  minutes. Set an alarm – it’s easy to lose track of time when you’re working alone. Ban browsing Taking a break doesn’t mean going on social media or internet shopping. It’s so easy to spend £ in a few clicks on your favourite sites. Instead, step away from your desk. Do a few stretches, or sit in your garden with a cup of tea so you can top up your vitamin D.  Snack right At home, you’re always only a few steps away from food. Before you open that bar of chocolate ask ­yourself, “How will I feel after I’ve eaten this ” Choose healthy snacks. Love your lunch Treat yourself to a proper lunch hour, make something healthy and colourful. Why not have a “virtual lunch date” with friends or colleagues  Put them on speakerphone and chat as you eat. Social contact is important and will help combat feelings of isolation. Step away from the TV Never eat lunch in front of the TV. You’ll soon be lured into watching Loose Women and, trust me, that will only lead to Judge Rinder .

The Sussexes have been hunting for a home in the Malibu, Pacic Palisades and the Pacic Coast Highway corridor of Los Angeles for more than  months. The pair, who today dropped their HRH titles after stepping away from royal le, have been milling over purchasing a private estate, close to a beach. The locations are near to several A-list communities, which is driving distance to the biggest Hollywood studios. Meghan’s family claims the Duchess, who is now available for Hollywood work opportunities, always wanted to “ home and raise her family there.” The region Harry and Meghan plan to set up a base is close to the palatial luxury home where Princess Diana hoped to live, just months before her tragic death. Her boyfriend at the time, Dodi Fayed, had picked out this secluded Malibu spot, which he had insisted was where they planned to relocate after they got married. And similarly to Meghan and Harry’s homes, the estate boasts the same amenities and privacy they hope for. Friends say that while the Sussexes are renting in Bel Air, they are hunting a house “which will be home”. “Over the last few months they have been looking at residences in that stretch of the city,” a source said.  “There is at least one very high profile, high-end realtors , who has been home spotting for them privately. “Meghan has made it no secret to those in her le from even before meeting Harry she hoped to live on the beach eventually. “Now, with her freedom, money from Suits, husband’s fortune and obvious future earning potential means that splashing as much as £ million is achievable.” Diana’s planned beachfront mansion boasts one of the best views in Calornia, and its six acres of gardens made it an ideal family retreat. Movie producer Dodi saw the luxury spot as the perfect hideaway for the ousted Royal, who spent last few years alive wanting away from the limelight. Diana and Dodi’s LA dream was confirmed by the actor who played the Hollywood mogul in ’s hit film Diana about the British icon’s le.  Cas An, who spent months consulting with Dodi’s closest friends, claims he and Diana were planning a new le in Hollywood and starting a family. Friends of Dodi felt that Diana would have built a le in Hollywoodtheir lives hadn’t ended tragically in Paris. “I spoke to many of his friends, and they wanted to live in America. I think she would have liked it here. “She and Dodi were similar in the things in le they liked...movies, dining out and travel. They had similar tastes. So this would have been perfect.” The home is set back from the famous pacic coast highway in the heart of Malibu’s luxury Paradise Cove area close to star neighbours including Pamela Anderson, Jenner Aniston, Courtney Cox, Cher, Paris Hilton, The Edge and Mel Gibson. The hilltop home was also a five minutes stroll by beach or sidewalk to the famous Paradise Cove Cafe. The quiet spot is a favourite for A-listers to hang out with their families unbothered.  Stars like David Beckham, Gwen Stefani and Robbie Williams have all been spotted with friends at the relaxing beach.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailEight hours after her birth in , Kamiyah Mobley was taken from her mother’s arms by a woman posing as a nurse in a sickening kidnap which sparked one of America’s longest-running missing person’s cases. Kamiyah grew up not knowing that her “mother” was her kidnapper – until three years ago, when she was , a series of tip-offs led police to her home and DNA tests proved her true identity. Now reunited with her real family, she sits with her father Craig Aiken as he sends a message to Madeleine McCann’s parents, telling Kate and Gerry to look to his story and “never give up hope” that their daughter will be found alive. Craig, , says: “We are bound together by the terrible crimes that befell our daughters. Very few parents in the world are united by such an atrocious wrong. But I have worn the shoes the Kate and Gerry now wear. I have walked the footsteps they now tread and I have come out the other side.” He says he would welcome the chance to speak to the McCanns, whose three-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May , . He says: “I know only too well their very real pain ain’t going to stop until their child comes home and that’s when the healing is going to begin. “All I ever used to say is that Kamiyah is coming home. Never once did I give up on my hopes and prayers. I never felt once Kamiyah was dead. I never gave up hope. I would teach Kate and Gerry hope. “They have to stick together because sometimes you blame it on each other as we did. It can tear you apart. It takes away the concern for the child.” Kamiyah Mobley was snatched from a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, in July  by Gloria Williams, who had entered new mum Shanara Mobley’s room posing as a nurse telling her the baby had a fever and had to be checked. Williams left the ward with the baby and raised Kamiyah as her own, giving her the  name, Alexis Manigo, and a forged birth certicate. Three years ago, after a series of tip-offs, police found Kamiyah in Walterboro, South Carolina,  miles from where she was born, living with her abductor. Williams is serving  years for the kidnap, while -year-old Kamiyah tries to come to terms with her true origins.  Her relationship with her birth mother is strained, but Kamiyah and her father Craig have a strong bond. At the time of her birth, music producer Craig was in jail on a minor drugs charge. He explains how a female officer broke the news of her kidnap. Craig says: “She said, ‘I have good news and bad news’. I said, ‘What’s the good news, because I am already in jail. What could be worse than this ’.She said, ‘Your daughter was born seven pounds eight ounces. Her name is Kamiyah’. I began to get excited, and then I saw no one  around me was. “I asked her what the bad news was, and she said, ‘Your daughter was kidnapped’. I was like ‘kidnapped ’. “I was confused. I was hurt. I was lost. I couldn’t understand or process what it all meant. To me, kidnapping was only on TV or in the movies.” Craig and Shanara were then treated as suspects, much as Gerry and Kate were by the Portuguese police, who named them “arguidos”. Craig says: “The police and FBI kept asking meI had any enemies or do I owe anybody money.  “But it was only after my release from jail, I realised I was becoming a suspect when they spent more time on me than the actual kidnapping.” Craig says: “I know like the McCanns what it’s like to be a parent that was accused or had suspicion upon them. It felt like the world turned against me at a time when you needed it most. “All you wanted was to find your daughter. You just want the nightmare to end.But because of what the police didn’t put out, the lack of information made us suspects.“One of the main reasons Kamiyah was kidnapped for so long was because the police wasted so much time on us. “If they would have used as much focus and harassment that they used on me to find her, she would have been found.The same goes for Madeleine. It felt like I was under suspicion for  years almost. “Eighteen years went by, and people still suspected her mother and me of kidnap.It was only when Kamiyah was found that the suspicion on us ever stopped.”  Asked whether he believes any harm could have come to Madeleine, Craig says: “I hope it ain’t too late for their daughter. “I’m not saying that she has come to any harm. “I never once thought that about my daughter and they shouldn’t about theirs. “I would tell them to keep hoping becauseit happened to me, then it can happen to them.” Kamiyah then gives her own message to the McCanns.She says: “I am the proof that eventually we find our way back home.Never give up that Maddie will one day do the same too. Take heart, and we are always here for you.” Since being found Kamiyah’s relationship with her birth mother, who split from Craig soon after the kidnapping, has had its up and downs.  At one point, Shanara revealed she was not even on speaking terms with Kamiyah because of her daughter’s continued attachment to Williams. Shanara said: “I shouldn’t have to compete with a kidnapper – she has to pick one of us.” She said the pain of being rejected by Kamiyah had cut just as deep as the day Williams kidnapped her.  She said: “It’s like a tug of war between us. Whenever I feel I’m winning her back, boom, the other side pulls me down.” Earlier this year, Kamiyah said she would still like to see her “mother” Gloria Williams, saying: “I just want to let her know I’m okay.” But Kamiyah’s relationship with her father has become incredibly strong.

The stories of their long war of attrition in hospital with killer Covid- have become beacons of hope for the region, blighted by death. Baby Leo fought the virus for  days but has now ed home to Corbetta in Lombardy. His mum told local media: I was worried a lot, especially at night. I do not wish that on any mother.Follow the latest coronavirus updates in our live blogMeanwhile Italica fought the virus for  days. The steely elder has been dubbed aposThe Immortalapos by jubilant doctors. She survived the Spanish Flu when she was a baby around Leonardoaposs age. Local media reports mayor Marco Ballarini described Leo as the wonderful face of hope. The tough tot has lted the regionaposs spirits, he said.  He added: Today we have a reason to smile and be happy, to feel like we are part of a community. Today, we look at the wonderful face of hope.

The average age of someone to die from coronavirus in Italy is . Doctors are now studying Italicaaposs case. Dr Sicbaldi said: She only had some mild coronavirus symptoms, so we tested her and she was positive, but we did very little, she recovered on her own.  It is possible that Italica also survived the  Spanish Flu outbreak, which killed million people in Europe when she was a baby. Dr Sicbaldi added: We got serological samples, she is the first patient we know that might have gone through the aposSpanish fluapos since she was born in . Italica was discharged from hospital on March  and is now in a care home. She is being supported by her nephew, Renato Villa Grondona, after her son died in the US decades ago.

The city went further than the Governmentaposs temporary closure of aposwet marketsapos, where animals are sold, by permanently stopping the brutal trade. The Covid- outbreak is believed to have started at the a aposwet marketapos in Wuhan, China.The law is set to come into effect on May , the Daily Star reports.A spokesman for the cityaposs government said: Dogs and cats as pets have established a much closer relationship with humans than all other animals, and banning the consumption of dogs and cats and other pets is a common practice in developed countries and in Hong Kong and Taiwan. This ban also responds to the demand and spirit of human civilization. The legislation also claries with species are permitted to be consumed, including pig, cattle, sheep, rabbit, and chicken. Dr Peter Li, China policy specialist for animal protection charity Humane Society International, welcomed the news. He said: “With Shenzhen taking the historic decision to become mainland China’s first city to ban dog and cat meat consumption, this really could be a watershed moment in efforts to end this brutal trade that kills an estimated  million dogs and  million cats in China every year. The majority of these companion animals are stolen from people’s back yards or snatched from the streets, and are spirited away on the backs of trucks to be beaten to death in slaughterhouses and restaurants across China. Shenzhen is China’s fth-largest city so although the dog meat trade is fairly small there compared with the rest of the province, its true signicance is that it could inspire a domino effect with other cities following suit. Dr Teresa M. Telecky, vice president of the wildle department for Humane Society International, added: “Shenzhen is the first city in the world to take the lessons learned from this pandemic seriously and make the changes needed to avoid another pandemic.

The -year-old is said to have moved his entire harem of concubines into the high end Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Baia after he was given permission by authorities. Baia is under lockdown, like the rest of Germany, and the hotel should be closed down along with all the others but it was apparently been given special permission to remain open for the king and his bizarre court. It is not knownthe kingaposs FOUR wives are among the group. King Vajiralongkorn has long been a controversial figure in Thailand, where it is banned from criticising the royal family, or even their pets. Despite the threat of  years in prison, he is criticised in his home country, albeit in private. As the oldest monarch to ascend to Thailandaposs throne, King Vajiralongkorn, has been married four times and has a colourful private le. Said to be worth £billion the royal has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, from his marriages, to his mistresses and even a leaked video of the queen naked apart from a G-string. Back in November  a home video of the royal and his third we, Srirasmi Suwadee, was leaked. The queen was wearing nothing but a G-string while servants waited on her hand of foot at the celebration of his pet poodleaposs birthday.That same year Harry Nicolaides, am Australian, was jailed for three years after he published a book which contained the sentencethe prince fell in love with one of his minor wives and she betrayed him, she and her family would disappear with their name, familial lineage and all vestiges of their existence expunged forever. Nicolaides was later pardoned by the king and he said his book had been entirely fiction from cover to cover.Two years later, one of Vajiralongkornaposs royal planes was seized by German authorities as payment for a £million debt owed to a German firm, which was in danger of becoming bankrupt. Vajiralongkorn finally agreed to pay £million, which was then covered by the Thai government. He married his first we, Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara, in  and the couple welcomed their daughter, Princess Najrakitiyabha. However, during his first marriage, Vajiralongkorn embarked on an affair with actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth, with whom he had five children. Despite repeated requests, Princess Soamsawali refused to orce her husband until he finally got his wish in , claiming the fault of the marriageaposs failure lay squarely at his weaposs door. Even so, his first we and their daughter continue to play a major part in royal events. Vajiralongkorn, still a prince, then married the woman he had been having an affair with for more than  years - but their wedding was not blessed by the queen. Just two years after their marriage Yuvadhida moved to Britain with all of the coupleaposs children - the prince did not react well. He put posters up all around the palace, accusing his we of adultery and eventually abducted his daughter and brought her back to Thailand to live with him. She was later elevated to the rank of princess, but his we and their sons were stripped of their royal titles and they all now live in the US. His third we was Srirasmi Suwadee, who had worked for the prince since . The marriage was kept from the public for four years, finally been disclosed in . Srirasmi gave birth to the coupleaposs son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, in the same year and was made a princess by her husband, who vowed his wild days were behind him. But nine years later Vajiralongkorn demanded his weaposs family be stripped of their royal titles amid allegations of corruption among her relatives. His we relinquished her royal titles soon afterwards and agreed to a orce after  years of marriage after being awarded a £.million settlement. Just three days before he was crowned king, Vajiralongkorn married his fourth we, Suthida Tidjai, who was a former acting commander of Royal Thai Aide-de-Camp Department. However, despite once again being a married man Vajiralongkorn was still not faithful and just months after his wedding he gave his concubine Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi the title of Chao Khun Phra, which means royal noble consort. The -year-old had become the first royal consort in Thailand for almost a century in almost  years and meant she was an official companion to the king but not the queen.

Looking back, that only makes the win all the more remarkable.For United, it was a far grander venue and harks back to the good old daysof regularly competing for big trophies.The  League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen was my first experience of covering a big club game at Hampden. It was a great day with a huge Tangerine following rewarded with an amazing comeback victory thanks to Callum Morris and Nadir Ctci headers.Everyone has their own favourites and this stoppage is a great time to reminisce – hopefully, we won’t have to do that for too long.Uefa are due to meet via video conference today to thrash out some sort of plan for sorting how the current season ends.I’m glad to hear that’s because it’s pretty much certain their initial hopes to get club football completed by the end of June won’t be coming to fruition.August seems to be the consensus and it sounds fair enough.What I expect to come out of this virtual get-together is some sort of rational plan to sort out player contracts and technical issues like that.That’s what Uefa is there for. What I don’t expect them to do is grant the SPFL’s wishes by making tough decisions on how to end this season.I can’t help but think Neil Doncasterand SFA chief Ian Maxwellare desperate for Uefa to make a sweeping decision so they can avoid any sort of responsibility when people moan.My gut feeling is the European chiefs will have a plan to get the campaign finished in the autumn and roll straight into the new one. I would dearly love our set-up to be restructured to bigger leagues, however.After watching the  Scottish Cup Final on Sunday it made me think ‘where have all the cup finals gone’ It’s been five long years since Dundee United were last in a major cup final and  for Dundee. The end of my first season at the Tele saw the Tangerines in the Scottish Cup Final and then the League Cup showpiece a year later.It just shows how quickly things can fall apart – thankfully, both seem to be putting the pieces back together.To keep me amused I’ve been watching the Leeds United documentary on Amazon. I love these shows but think they are missing a trick not doing Scottish football – imagine all the bonkers stories they’d get up here!LEE WILKIE: I have sympathy for Neil Doncaster and Ian Maxwell but they need to grab the bull by the horns and show leadership\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-neil-doncaster-ian-maxwell embed # secretBXEngLa\" data-secret\"BXEngLa\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273500-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273500-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273500-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273500-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"jordan mcghee is determined the coronavirus lockdown wont knock dundee off course","story":"Dundee defender Jordan McGhee hopes they are able to pick up where they left off before the coronavirus lockdown.Scottish football has been shut down for almost three weeks now after the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put the Dark Blues’ Championship season on hold.The Dee had been in a rich vein of form, with a six-match unbeaten run seeing them rise to third, well-positioned for a place in the Premiership promotion play-offs.The waters remain murky as to how the current campaign will find its resolution. However, former Hearts and Falkirk man McGhee hopes it’s with Dundee having success.“We want to pick up where we left off because before the shutdown we started to hit a bit of form,” the -year-old said.“We knew that what would happen it was just about getting the right balance in the team.“I think we’ve got that now so we’re just raring to go again and finish the season as strongly as possible.”McGhee insists the squad are working together remotely to stay motivated and fit for a potentialto action.“I think some people will struggle but you don’t have an option right now other than to motivate yourself,” he added.“The way the world is at the moment you’ve either got the option to sit and watch TV, lying about doing nothing or you go out and exercise yourself.“Everyone in our changing-room will be going out to stay fit. I know the boys well enough to know everyone in the team is motivated to be successful.“Running and making sure they’re ready to go when football resumes is a big part of that.“We’ve got a few WhatsApp groups – one with the coaches and one with the players.“The coaching staff keep on top of us with our fitness stuff but everything is up in the air at the moment.“No one knows what’s happening so really it’s just a guessing game at the moment for us.“The manager’s been good, though, in keeping us going. We’ve been given tasks like a weekly challenge on a Friday.“Last week it was to do a k under  minutes on top of our programmes which have been tailored and specically set out.“With regards to the manager I think he trusts us all to go away and do it ourselves butwe don’t we know we’ll be found out when we go back.“It’s dficult because, normally, you’re building up towards a weekend where you’ve got a game coming up.“We’ve not got that now so it’s dficult to stay prepared for what may or may not happen physically and mentally.“The fact you’re not with the boys as well makes training dficult. The mental aspect is hard for everyone at the minute, in all walks of le.“We just need to get on with it and see what the outcome is then take it from there.”On top of everything , McGhee is working his way back from surgery on an ongoing wrist problem he’d carried for most of the season.His progress, however, has been good as he attempts to step up his rehab in the coming weeks.“I was in Dundee two weeks ago to get my cast off but ever since then I’ve been at home in East Kilbride,# he said.“I’ve just been staying in the house apart from my training programme. I’ve been out running and I managed to get myself a set of weights – that’s all I can really do right now.“Having broken a bone in my wrist it’s been dficult. Obviously, because I can’t get in to seeGerryto do movements on it.“He’s sending me stuff out, though, now I’ve had my cast off for a bit.“I’ll crack on with that and, hopefully, by the time football comes round again it should be strengthened and ready to go.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273500-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273500-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273500-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273500-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie neil doncaster ian maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":null,"title":"managing the coronavirus shut down has been my toughest test as dundee boss says james mcpake","story":"The first year as a manager brings all sorts of challenges but James McPake admits dealing with the coronavirus from a football point of view takes the biscuit.The Dundee boss has had plenty to deal with during his debut campaign, including heavy derby defeats, issues with the law and a restless home support.Pressure has always been a major part of the role and it was ramped up during poor spells in the first half of the Championship campaign.McPake has always had more experienced heads to turn to for advice throughout his time in charge, whether assistant manager Jimmy Nicholl, technical director Gordon Strachan or someone outside the club.The current complete shutdown of Scottish football, however, is completely unprecedented.“This is one I can’t go to anyone for advice,” admits Dens gaffer McPake.“Nobody has faced anything like this. For loads of other stuff you can get advice, going on bad runs, good runs, heavy defeats, good times.“My first year has been a challenge.

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/DNic_Whorterbank_Signs-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"whorter

Here, we share their answers to some of those key questions:There is currently no evidence that food is a source of coronavirus and it is very unlikely that it can be transmitted through the consumption of food, according to the European Food Safety Authority.Coronavirus is not a foodborne gastrointestinal virus like noroviruswhich causes illness through eating contaminated food.Covid- is a respiratory illness and the transmission route of Covid- is thought to happen mainly through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.It is possible for Covid- to be spread indirectly when someone touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth or nose, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Thorough and frequent handwashing will further reduce any risk of spreading Covid- indirectly through contact with potentially contaminated surfaces.Also, based on what we know about similar coronaviruses, the virus would be inactivated through proper cooking and would be removed from food preparation surfaces by thorough cleaning and disinfection.Whilst food is not considered to be a source or transmission route for Covid- it’s always important to follow the four key steps of food safety—cooking, cleaning, chilling and preventing cross contamination – to reduce the risks of all foodborne illness. vw, px\"  Indirect contact with Covid- through touching a surface or object that has the virus on it is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. However, thoroughand frequent hand washing will help to minimise the potential for indirectly spreading the virus from any surfaces that may have become exposed, including packaged and unpackaged foods. Hygienic handling of food is important to prevent the transmission of any bacterial or viral infection – not just Covid-.You are advised to wash your hands thoroughly after handling food deliveries or unpacking your food and drink at home on ing from the supermarket. Try not to touch your face while you are unpacking the products and disposing of any outer packaging.Follow good food hygiene and wash fruit and vegetables by rubbing under water and peeling the outer layers or skins,appropriate.Based on the current evidence, the risk of imported food and packaging from affected countries being contaminated on arrival into the UK is considered to be very low. This is because the legislation requires appropriate controls to be in place to ensure good hygienic practices are followed by the exporter during the packing and shipping process.Food Standards Scotland’s advice is never to deal with cold callers selling food at the door, especially those offering to supply fish, poultry and meat. We would advise consumers to only purchase food from established supermarkets and local food stores and suppliers which are open for business."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.1214789-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.1214789-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.1214789-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.1214789-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"council postpones election","story":"An Aberdeen by-election has been officially postponed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.The election for the Kincorth, Nigg and Cove ward was due to be held on May  after Stephen Flynn was elected as MP for Aberdeen South.However, legislation was passed last week giving local authorities the power to postpone votes – and Aberdeen City Council has confirmed it will now not go ahead.The vote will now take place in November.In a statement, the council said: “Legislation has been passed in light of the coronavirus pandemic which allows ing officers to postpone forthcoming Scottish local government by-elections and set a new date.“Returning officer Fraser Bell has decided to postpone the Kincorth Nigg Cove by-election and set the new polling day as Thursday, November  .”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273680-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273680-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273680-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53273680-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"my lockdown diary by cultercullen primary pupil matthew mcnair","story":"My name is Matthew and I am eight years old.I feel very sad about school being closed because it isn’t such a fun learning experience when you can’t see friends.To pass the time I have been doing the Joe Wicks workout with the whole family.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding.

Based on a hillside, looking down towards Kilchurn Castle, the Tigh Mor project has been developed over several years and has included many volunteers, including primary school pupils.The project has shown evidence of rural le in the th and th-centuries and has clearly demonstrated how archaeology can bring people of all ages together to help develop a site and create a wider interest in their local heritage.The next meeting will be held at .pm on Tuesday March , in the Nicoll Hall.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus claims 16 more lives in scotland","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe number of people in Scotland who have died from COVID- has risen to , the First Minister has announced.The coronavirus death toll rose by  on yesterday with confirmed cases now up to , from , yesterday.A total of  people are in intensive care as the virus accelerates, she said, although numbers are regarded as underestimate.In addition, she confirmed today that the popular Edinburgh Fringe Festival would not take place this summer, bringing to an end rumours it may happen on a much smaller scale.Addressing questions about the availability of ventilators in Scotland, Mrs Sturgeon said the Scottish Government #had a number# on order with overseas manufacturers.#Those orders will be delivered,they stay on track, over the period of the next number of weeks and by the summer,# she said.#It will take us to roundabout more than a thousand ventilators.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But, similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore, covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.As of Monday,March , the prime minister has put the UK into lockdown and instructed all citizens to stay at home.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the

hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-accidentally-swears-instead-saying-name-journalist","story":"The First Minister was delivering her latest update on Scotlandrsquos battle against the highly contagious disease while taking questions from reporters via the Zoom online .:William Grant  Sons to help make hand sanitiser for USBut the SNP leader suffered a slight gaffe after asking to hear from Wave FM journalist Greg Flucker.Happy with #how #@NicolaSturgeon# pronounced your name there #@Gregflucker#  # pic xJCigPOTeSturgeon powered on with her answer, however, a few viewers picked up on the slight error, including Eveningjournalist Dave Lord - who later posted a short clip of the gaffe on social media.He wrote: ldquoHappy with #how #@NicolaSturgeon# pronounced your name there #@Gregflucker#  When someone hands you the list of journalists waiting to ask questions and someone has scribbled @Gregflucker in dodgy handwriting... pic FJzdaRBZNMr Flucker took the mistake in good humour, responding: ldquoThe FM isnrsquot the first and she wonrsquot be the last:Coronavirus pandemic sparks Tunnocks shortageOthers pointed out Ms Sturgeons sign interpreter also appeared to notice the mistake.The expression on the BSL signerrsquos face is a picture...Ms Sturgeon later addressed the gaffe on Twitter, replying to Mr Fluckers tweet saying: \"My apologies for the mispronunciation - ill get it right next time!\""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-snp-government-withdraws-plans-suspend-jury-trials","story":"The move had been part of emergency legislation to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said new legislation will be put forward in three weeks time, following consultation withthe legal community and victims organisations.It follows an outcry from the legal profession and opposition politicians.The Scottish Criminal Bar Association had labelled the plans \"draconian\".\"They should not at a stroke remove the fundamental principle of the right of those citizens charged with serious offences to a trial by a jury of their peers within a reasonable time.ldquoThe SCBA believes that these draconian measures seeking to bring about seismic changes to our system of justice are premature, disproportionate and ill-advised.\"They are at best a knee-jerk reaction to an as yet unquantied problem instigated by panic or at worst, something far more sinister.\"The SCBA also called plans to extend statutory time limits on cases coming to court \"wholly unnecessary\" andcautioned against the relaxation of rules around hearsay evidence.Nicola Sturgeon previously saidthe suspension of jury trials wasnecessary to ensure serious criminal trials did not halt entirely.She said:ldquoWe would never have wanted to be in a position to pass legislation like this.\"We wouldnrsquot be doing it unless we thought it was necessary for the protection of the population.Elsewhere, the Scottish Government confirmed it will amend plans toextend theof time given to public bodies to respond to Freedom of Information requests.Opposition politicians welcomed the U-turn.Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said the removal of jury trials would be a \"retrograde\" step and \"hard to justy\".He said: \"There are other solutions here that I think need to be properly considered.\"He suggested measures such asdelaying jury trials, linking juries to the court by TV screens,or holding cases in larger venues to allow social distancing.Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said:\"The Scottish Governments sharp U-turn on its plans to end jury trials is important.ldquoPeople in Scotland have had jury trials for  years, through wars, disease and pestilence.ldquoWhen SNP ministers look at this again they need to remember that a shiver ran down peoplersquos spines at the idea they wanted to go further than any government in the world to end our system of justice.\"A pillar of our justice system must not be pushed to one side by the unilateral action of a minority government.\"Peoples lives depend on the outcome of these trials andScots have been able to present their evidence to a jury for almost  years.ldquoThere are ways we can keep jurors safe and keep our justice system intact.\"Scottish ministers willto Holyrood with new legislation relating to the courts on April .More to followShops across Scotland are closing.

This is the only way to ensure people continue to get the financial support they need. It provides certainty and security of payment at a time of great anxiety.ldquoWhile I cannot make guarantees around a revised timeline for the introduction of these benefits, I can guarantee that the work will not stop.

Claims have been made that banks are charging interest on loans as high as  per cent.UK Finance, the bank trade body, said: \"Lenders are working hard to get financing to all businesses who need it as quickly as possible and are using the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme where appropriate, with some funding having already been provided under the scheme.It added: \"All lenders will take into account a businesss inidual circumstances when considering applications and many business loans can be provided either unsecured or secured on business assets.\"But Kirsty McGregor of the Corporate Finance Network, told the BBC: \"Small and medium-sized businesses employing less than  people employ most of the workforce: m people.\"We could lose up to a million of them in the next month or so.

Its Britain this and Britain that, and we are one big happy family living in a Dadrsquos Army world.That was the script for the first week of lockdown, anyway. Now there is a new mood gathering, and not before time.: How Scotland hit deaths recordIt was understandable in the early phases of this crisis that there should be a rush to suspend politics as usual. The first PMQs and FMQs as the extent of the emergency emerged were models of restraint, civility and supportiveness.In journalism too, as in society at large, there was an instinctive reluctance to point fingers. Given the enormity of what has happened, and the rate at which the pandemic has unfolded, many have been, again understandably, stunned into quietude and acquiescence. Surrounded by so much suffering and loss it seemed almost trivial, unhelpful even, to fret over details. Everyone was trying their best in a situation none of us had experienced before.We knew this already from the experience of South Korea and Singapore. We know, too, that testing is vital in getting self-isolating NHS staff back to workthey have had the all-clear.: Edinburgh festivals cancelledBut here we are, some  days later ndash a relative eternity in terms of this virus ndash and governments in London and Edinburgh are failing to hit their targets on testing. There were supposed to be , people tested a day, building to ,. Even this was pathetically low compared to Germany, which can carry out three times that. Yet the UK cannot even hit the lower mark. On Monday,  people were tested. There are not enough kits and labs to ramp up testing to the level required. This is not the first time that reality has failed to match government promises. Remember the antibody test that would tell peoplethey had had the virus and were now most likely immune  The one described by Boris Johnson on March  as a ldquogame-changer  The Prime Minister said trials could start within a month. Weeks on, how close are we to a roll out of these tests Then there is the great Personal Protective Equipmentmystery. Every day a Minister or health official stands at a podium in Downing Street and reels out the statistics on how many masks are available, how many aprons. Millions and millions we are told.Yet also every day, NHS and social care staff are reporting that they do not have the equipment that gives them a fighting chance of staying safe and well. It is scandalous in a supposedly advanced, wealthy society that NHS doctors have to set up a crowdfunding site to buy essential items. Well done and god bless the likes of Scots actor James McAvoy who donated pound, to the campaign, but it should not be necessary in the first place.: Warning on small firmsOn all these matters, and more, governments must be held to account. With Westminster and Holyrood going into recess, and possibly sitting for fewer days when they , it is even more essential that the media is allowed to do its job.We have, of course, the daily press conferences in London and Edinburgh. While vital, they have their limitations, the most obvious of which is the lack of follow-up questions. Time and again the questions being asked are not answered, but there is no comeback and the show rolls on.What is required, in addition to these daily press conferences, are extended interviews with Ministers.

That could be a long way down the road. Many will have to account for what they did, or did not do, in this crisis and explain how vital time was lost in preparing for it.In the meantime, the public has to feel sure it is being told everything it needs to know, and that the steps being taken by governments are the right ones.

The programme reveals that at the same time, Cass brother Martin was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease putting a crushing strain on both and leading to a dficult conversation over whether they could continue their pioneering work.The pair resolved to carry on, however, Cass brother died a few months later aged just , and in February last year Laura received the devastating news that partner Kat had taken her own le.The documentary highlights how the loss of former player Kat sent waves of shock and grief right through the club, leaving players and coaching staff battling to cope.Club manager Laura said: ldquoThe day Kat died is the worst day of my le and always will be. Kat was my world.ldquoWhen you lose that one thing that is the real reason to get you up in the morning, you realise that you dont get as much enjoyment out of stu#.ldquoWhen something good happens to me or something quirky, the only person I want to tell it to, is Kat, but shes not there to tell anymore and its really challenging. I really miss her.Despite being born in dferent decades and dferent cities, both grew up with a razor-like focus for football which was confounded by a male-dominated sport, with only a handful of female role-models and a dearth of opportunities to take part.Cas, who as a youngster is recalled pushing a football instead of a doll in her toy pram, met Laura in the s when both played for Glasgow Universityrsquos womenrsquos football team.The two ndash described in the programme as like a ldquocomedy double act - found a shared determination to confront the lack of equal opportunities in the sport, leading to them hatching a kitchen table plan to create a club of their own.Glasgow City chairperson Cas, , from Newlands in Glasgow, said: ldquoI just remember thinking, Ive just got to change it. Ive just got to do something to make this possible and keep pushing forwards so that it is possible because its not fair.Laura, , from Clarkston in East Renfrewshire, adds: ldquoEven as a young kid, I would never accept that girls shouldnt be allowed to do something, even though everyone perceived that as the norm, I certainly didnt perceive it as the norm and I set out to change it.Glasgow City FC won the league in its inaugural season and is now the most successful club in the country with  domestic league titles to its name and a thriving academy facility offering training for girls.While the clubs closest competition in recent years has come from Hibs, moves by Rangers and Celtic into professional womens game has raised the stakes, setting the scene for a season which, had Covid- not happened, would have been one of the most competitive for years.Professor Karen Boyle, Professor of Feminist Media Studies and Programme Director for the MSc in Applied Gender Studies at University of Strathclyde, said the Glasgow City pioneers arrived at a time when equality was entering a new phase.\"In the Nineties, there was this sense of oh, weve done that, equality is done. We had Blairs babes, we had girl power, we had this sense that actually, equality had been achieved which of course was a complete fiction,\" she said.\"Particularly in arenas like sport, the advances that had been made were so, so tiny, there was still so much of a way to go. I think it made it even more challenging to do work on womens rights in that period.\"What theyre up against is age-old stereotypes about who girls and women are and what they can and cant do and also what football is and who football is for.\"Writer, producer and director of the documentary, Margot McCuaig, said: Since childhood, Cas and Laura have pushed against stereotypical perceptions that football is a mans game and have worked hard to break down gender barriers.\"In realising their ambition to create their own football club they have subsequently created opportunities for girls to follow their dreams in a welcoming environment.\"The Women Who Built Glasgow City is on BBC ALBA on Sunday, April  at pm and later on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : amThis week#s edition of the newspaper is now available and is online, here.

The payments industry, including all contactless card issuers, has completed all the work to enable retailers to upgrade as soon as they can.If a retailer wants to start accepting contactless payments at the higher limit of £ it should get in touch with its acquirer.For consumers spending more than £ there are many ways to choose to pay, for example through Chip  PIN and other alternatives such as mobile payments which do not have an upper limit when authenticated through biometric technologies.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As a result, we’ve had to take the decision to focus our efforts on the collection and disposal of household and commercial waste, while suspending our recycling services.”The following changes will be made:Mr Richardson added: “In normal times, we greatly appreciate the efforts people make to recycle a wide range of household and commercial items. But these are far from normal times, which is why we’ve had to make the dficult decision to suspend our recycling services.“We are not the only Council making this move, and we understand that  of the  local authorities across Scotland are also working on revised arrangements.“We are asking folkat all possible to store their recycling until these services can begin again. We’re aware that this won’t be an option for everyone, but we would ask that recyclable items are only included as a last resort on grey bin collection days.”He added: “People will be disappointed, and we apologise for the inconvenience these measures will cause. But in these unprecedented times, there is a need to ensure we can continue with the most essential operations with a limited workforce during the weeks and months ahead.“We ask all businesses and householders to be considerate during this time and to make every effort to minimise the waste that is put out for collection, bearing in mind that higher than normal volumes can cause delays and missed collections for other households and businesses.“We are extremely grateful for your co-operation during this dficult period and also for the efforts of our office and depot staff, crews and drivers, who are already going above and beyond in providing vital waste collection services under extremely challenging conditions.”Any further changes will be announced through local media, on the Council website and using OIC’s social media channels.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This came as welcome news to Orkney MSP Liam McArthur, who had previously highlighted these concerns. The moves were also welcomed by Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.The Loganair aircraft will be based at Glasgow Airport but can operate throughout Scotland.   Loganair pilots will be operating the aircraft as usual, and late last week, all received a special briefing from the airline and the Scottish Ambulance Service on the nature of the deployment.Work has continued in Loganair’s Engineering and Flight Operations teams at Glasgow over the weekend and into this week to ensure full readiness of the aircraft ahead of full mission readiness from Friday  April.Loganair is also now working to convert a larger Saab  aircraft, capable of operating into all Highlands and Islands airports apart from Barra, to become an air ambulance with the capability to carry two Epishuttle pods and accompanying medical teams simultaneously.  It is expected this aircraft will be available within the next seven days.Loganair’s Chief Executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “The team effort to make this happen, moving from a concept to an operational solution in just a week, has been absolutely incredible.#Between the SAS and Loganair teams, the concept, testing and training has all taken place and we’re also grateful for the support from the Civil Aviation Authority in progressing this project.“Although the circumstances under which all of this work has been undertaken are ones that we’d never have wished to see, I’m heartened that the effort which has gone into this is truly admirable.

The grief of losing loved ones is bad enough but not being able to go and visit their graves - it’s not asyou have to worry about social distancing in a cemetery.Others agreed: This is a step too far. The cemetery is not a social gathering.There is never anyone there when I go to visit my sons grave. I wish someone can tell me what purpose this will serve.If they even left the side gate open it would be a compromise.What about peoples mental health This is a total disgrace to deprive any of us a few quiet moments at the graveside of our loved ones.Another woman said: This is just not necessary! Its absolutely ridiculous. Nobody goes to a graveyard in large groups to have social gatherings!People go to have a quiet moment with a loved one and are then on their way again! This is the only walk for the day that some people do.One woman was bereft after burying her father on the same day as the announcement.She said: Im absolutely heartbroken at this.I have just laid my daddy to rest today and he never even got the send off he deserved.We couldnt bring him home and now I cant even visit to try to come to terms with his loss this. Its so heartbreaking.Others said they would have hoped for advance notice in order to pay a final visit to their loved ones and to put fresh flowers on graves.However, one woman posted: Folks, its my sons anniversary tomorrow.I will not be able to attend his grave as usual. However, instead of finding fault, I will accept this new ruling as a neccessary action for our continued safety.Many of you dont seem to have thought about those people who have died of the virus and the need to bury them as well. Remember we had the comfort of being present when our loved ones were buried or cremated - the families of those dying with Covid- will not get this andthe council need to keep the public out for safety then respect this request.They are not asking to upset you or infringe on your actions.

The North Antrim UUP assemblyman was speaking in his capacity as health minister as he set out key findings of an expert NI modelling study, which will inform intensive hospital planning for the forthcoming surge in Covid- cases.“In summary, the research indicates that our health service would have a realistic prospect of coping in this initial perioda sufficient proportion of the population adhere to the social distancing and self-isolation measures,” Mr Swann said.“However, it is important that this is considered in context, and I would emphasise that it provides no grounds whatsoever for dropping our guard. On the contrary, the projections underline that the continuation of rigorous social distancing will save many lives and protect our health service from collapse.“Even then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le In Northern Ireland.“In addition, the absence of a vaccine means we will have to plan for a potential second wave of Covid- cases later in the year.”The modelling outcome sets out a reasonable worst case scenario, based on a number of assumptions including social distancing measures producing a % reduction in contacts outside the home and workplace. In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation.The modelling team’s best judgement is that this would lead to a peak number of  Covid- patients requiring ventilation and critical care beds during the first wave of the epidemic. The peak number of Covid- hospital admissions would be  per week.Under this reasonable worst case scenario, the projected number of cumulative Covid- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,.The modelling indicates that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic is expected between - April .The modelling team authors emphasise that the work is not a prediction or forecast, rather a model for planning purposes and also state: “It is assumed that current restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future. When the current restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second wave. Future modelling will focus on the size and shape of this depending on how when restrictions are relaxed or re-introduced. This will remain the case until there is substantial population immunity either as a result of recovery from infection or successful vaccination.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"as global supply of vital oxygen cylinders dries up pharmacist calls for return of life saving equipment","story":"A local Community Pharmacy has issued an urgent appeal for theof empty and unused oxygen cylinders in the face of growing numbers of people contracting the coronavirus.Pharmacies across the North are dealing with a shortage of the cylinders which are used by patients with chronic respiratory conditions and in end-of-le care. vw, px\"  Putting your best foot forward # new social distancing markers introduced todayMichael Cooper, from Cooper’s Pharmacy, said that the shortage was creating a “national emergency situation” as Covid- continues to spread.“There might be some instances where a person has used oxygen or has finished the course, and for whatever reason there might be an empty cylinder in a back room or garage,” he said.“There is probably going to be a huge additional demand for oxygen cylinders in the days, weeks, and months ahead as we battle the Covid- pandemic.#The Andersonstown chemist says the availability of an oxygen tank could make the dference between le and death for someone who contracts Covid-.“One of the major problems with respect to Covid- and Coronavirus is that it is a respiratory illness with pneumonia-like symptoms.

Linda Stewart speaks to three frontline staff who are staying away from their dwellings to protect their loved ones.The AE nurseAE nurse Ruth McGreevy , from Newtownards, has moved into an Airbnb accommodation in Bangor in order to protect her mum and siblings who fall under the high risk category. Her boyfriend is Philip , a computer technicianAE nurse Ruth McGreevy has had fond memories of the Ulster Hospital since childhood when she was a frequent visitor due to her asthma.Now on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus, the -year-old from Newtownards is poised for the toughest battle of her le as the hospital prepares for a flood of patients hit by coronavirus.Although patients infected with Covid- have already started to appear at the Ulster Hospital - and there have been some deaths - there is still a sense that it is the calm before the storm.We shut down a bit of the AE to cater for people coming in, where we could call people in and treat them, send them to the ward or send them home. And then the past couple of weeks we#ve been closing off more and more of the AE, Ruth says.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home Ruth McGreevy, nurseObviously, the doctors and the managers are concerned that it#s coming because they#re shutting it down and we#re getting more in-depth training on how to deal with the really sick patients that come in. So it#s a bit scarier now that all this is taking place - everyone#s on tenterhooks just waiting for this to hit.All the wards have been emptied out to deal with this when it arrives and it#s quite bizarre lately going to the ward and seeing lots of empty beds, because that hasn#t happened in years.The staff have been getting special training in the personal protection they will wear, including masks, aprons and gloves.And then there are things like infection control, how to stop the spread. We#re learning how to work ventilators and respiratory equipment, Ruth says.That#s quite daunting - nurses generally wouldn#t really be doing much of that, but now we#re being taught it just in case we get into the circumstances where we might have to use them.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home.We all have families at home and sick people and children and things. You#re so scared of walking it back into your house, because you never know what will happen. You hear of people getting younger and younger with no medical history who are dying from this, so it#s scary.Ruth has a long association with the Ulster Hospital - she was born prematurely and had bad asthma when she was young, and spent a lot of time in the hospital.I just had lots of admissions with my chest as I had quite a lot of asthma attacks, so I was just in and out with that into Maynard Ward. They were always so nice and kind and my sister Eleanor was quite unwell as a child, so we spent a lot of time visiting her when I was little - I was just always around hospitals.It was this early experience that spurred her to become a nurse.I was struck with just how much a bit of kindness can do for someone, Ruth says.You can be so unwell and someone just giving you a nice smile or being kind - the smallest gesture can go a long way. Making someone a cup of tea sometimes goes a lot further than any other medication you can give them. with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Close family: Ruthwith her mum and sisters FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappClose family: Ruthwith her mum and sistersAfter leaving school, Ruth went to Queen#s University Belfast and worked as a healthcare assistant while studying to be a nurse. She is now an adult-trained AE nurse in the Ulster Hospital.Basically, it#s people walking in unwell, so it#s like doing bloods and ECGs, trying to figure out what#s wrong with people. Lately, I#ve been dealing with cardiac arrests and things like that, dealing with car accidents.Ruth lives with her mum Belleand sisters Sarah , Eleanorand Kirsty .In the past week she has been forced to make the dficult decision to move away from her family in order to protect them from the danger of infection.I#m the youngest, and I didn#t want to do it but my mum is , and she#s diabetic and has high blood pressure, Ruth says.My oldest brother Alex recently had four strokes and he was on chemotherapy treatment with quite an unusual disease that he has - nobody#s really heard of it. So he#s on chemotherapy and he would have quite a low immune system. My sister Eleanor has MS and my sister Kirsty is on immunosuppressant drugs for a stomach problem. I feel like a walking super-virus going into my house.I was thinking about it for a few weeks but I hadn#t really talked to my mum about it - I didn#t want to bring it up until I thought it was really necessary.But in the last week especially I noticed that a lot of the patients I#ve been looking after had been going off to the ward and were taken very unwell or there were people passing away. So, in my eyes I could see it escalating quite a lot and I felt like it was time to go. Ruth says her family was very upset that she had to move out. She was the youngest and had never been away from home for a long period of time.I#m only moving to Bangor - it#s not far but it#s more that I can#t come into the house and have a proper conversation with them, she says.My mum was very upset about it - she#s just worried. She keeps saying she might not see me again.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRuth with boyfriend Philip Ferguson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappRuth with boyfriend Philip FergusonRuth keeps in touch with her family and her boyfriend Philip , a computer technician, using video chat.I haven#t seen him in a month, she says.Along with another nursing colleague, Ruth has moved into an Airbnb accommodation at Gray#s Hill in Bangor thanks to the generosity of the couple who own it.They#ve given us the use of their house completely rent-free which is amazing - it#s so kind, she says.The kindness we#ve been shown at the moment is immense - like every day there#s more things being sent off to us. We#ll keep laughing, saying we#ll be rolling out of here after coronavirus because people are feeding us so much.We#re getting pizzas and doughnuts, and a big coffee van was up the other day giving everyone free coffee and sandwiches and everything. People are donating hand creams because we#ve washed our hands until they#re cracking and bleeding - people are giving us everything.The toughest thing just at the moment is all the new training, Ruth says.They#re saying things are going to get a lot harder for us because obviously this disease is airborne, so it#s when we go into the big proper masks that it will be scary.You#re just aware that you can#t take them off, she says.It#s just the fear in people#s eyes because they#re not allowed any visitors. So it#s trying to comfort those people - they#re so unwell and scared, and they can#t have anyone in their family with them.All you can do is just try and be as kind and caring as you can, staying with them, explaining why it#s happening, why their family can#t come in, we#ll look after them the best we can. It#s just being there to hold their hands when they need it.Ruth pays tribute to all the staff who are doing their bit to combat the disease.It takes an army in here, she says.To move a single patient to the ward, the whole corridor has to close because obviously people can#t walk into the corridor when you#re moving - so the amount of porters it takes and then the whole area has to be cleaned after one patient moves. The amount of people it takes to move one person is crazy. And you couldn#t do it without everybody - the teamwork going on at the minute is amazing.I know the Down AE has closed, so the staff from the Down AE have just come up today to the Ulster. So that#s extra doctors and extra nurses coming up, which is great.Ruth says the whole thing is very scary but the key thing is to try to keep positive.It#s all going to be over soon hopefully andwe all just do as we#re told it will be over sooner rather than later, hopefully, and we#ll come out the other side, she says.It really does prove how great everybody is that works for the NHS, not just nurses. We#re being supported at the minute, but it really isn#t just us - it#s everybody. It#s amazing seeing everyone pulling together.The social workerSocial worker Maria McNamee , from Londonderry, has moved in with a friend in Castlefin, Donegal, because she is concerned about putting her partner Gareth at riskI live with my partner of  or  years - it#s just me and him, she says.He has two of the conditions that put him at a really high risk - he has type one diabetes and is on immunosuppressants for Crohn#s disease. Each one of those would have put him in the at-risk category but the two together complicate things a bit more.Over the weekend the couple discussed the risk and made the dficult decision that Maria should move out.Because I#m still working and I#m out and about in contact with people, we decided the risk was too high, she says.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner Gareth FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner GarethEven before I moved out we were practising a bit of social distancing at home - we had moved into separate rooms and we stayed in separate parts of the house.I really thought we could just continue to do that - we didn#t go out with friends, we didn#t have people calling.We genuinely thought this would have been OK but the more we learned about the virus and how it is transmitted, it was like a bang at the weekend.The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment Maria McNamee, social workerIt was a really tough thing to do and we just felt it had to be done.We made the decision over the weekend and I packed my bags and left for work on Monday morning, not toreally. The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment.It#s a bit hard for us doing it - I can#t even imagine what it#s likeyou have children.Maria has moved in with a friend in Castlefin and works from home quite a lot, but there are still days when she has to go to the office or carry out home visits.Even though the rest of my family are living locally I#m still not seeing them either, she says.As a social worker with the looked-after children service, much of Maria#s work involves visits to children, families and foster parents.We#ve stepped some of that down but we#re doing a lot of phone support and there are still children that we need to visit, she says.It#s a tough job, so when you don#t have your own home comforts around you and your own routine of what you do, it#s really tough.This is the start of it - it#s been okay and it#s a lovely place, but I can only imagine when you#re two, three, four weeks down the line, and that#s only the start of it.I think there#s a real sense of people getting on with it and you are having to dig deep - I think everybody is doing it. I am so lucky with what I have here - for others out there, it must be so hard for them.The paramedicParamedic Rab McCoy , from Coleraine, has moved into a BB to protect vulnerable family members from infection. He is married to Tanya and has two children, Robbieand Rachel It was really from a personal point of view - there were a couple of things, he says.It was a matter of timing for me, trying to gauge the timing for this curve that is talked about in the news.I realised early on that I couldn#t work from home.My we had had a couple of bouts of cancer and had undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy and had her spleen removed, so it was a decision we talked about.

At first it may have seemed a bit like we needed to plan for the kids asit were a school holiday, but the level of social distancing required has meant that few of the things we normally do during holiday times are feasible. The fact that we must currently forbid social gatherings for our children may also be provoking some nervousness for parents, as we worry that all of this isolation may impact on our children#s sociability and the social and emotional development that is usually promoted by hanging out with, and playing with, their friends.Evenwe arrange to go for walks and come across other families we know, we have to keep at a distance that prevents the usual running around, hugging, tumbling, or horseplay that might occur in their play together. So, in their play, they won#t have any of the usual physical closeness that they might have enjoyed with friends.There is no doubt that the next whilewill be testing for children as they will miss out on lots of social interaction with their peers that they would normally have had. No birthday parties, no sleepovers, no playdates, no knocking for friends, no organised sports. It feels like a very signicant loss.I never thought I#d see myself write this, but suddenly technology and social media has real value for our social communication. While it is a dferent form of social connection, it does now play an increasingly important role in allowing our children and teenagers to stay in touch with friends, while maintaining the social distance needed to slow the spread of Covid-.While there is no doubt that this new social etiquette will impact on how we and our children can physically connect with our friends and extended family, the social distancing that we must practise, doesn#t have to lead to an emotional distancing or disrupt children#s emotional development.It is still really important, unless you are feeling unwell or need to socially isolate , that we maintain physical closeness in our families. Our children still need a loving touch from their parents. They need hugs, foot rubs and cuddles. Touch is such an important part of our social experience that our children cannot do without it for months. While our children may not be able to play with their friends, we can still promote their emotional development. In fact,we are all thrown together at home for extended periods there is more opportunity than ever to help children to learn about their feelings, to express those feelings and to process them healthily.Empathy is the mechanism by which we help children to develop emotionally. Le will provide children with the experiences that will provoke emotions. Our job is to help them to make sense of those emotions. The best way to understand what I am talking about might be for me to explain using an example. Let#s imagine you have a nine-year-old son, who is, by now, bored with being at home, restless, and perhaps cross that he can#t meet his friends. If he comes to you pleading, again, to be allowed to at least meet his friend just for a few minutes, many of us may have lost patience and may end snapping back at him, that he just can#t and to stop moaning, stop asking, let it go. While this is a natural response to our own frustration and stress of trying to manage the strange circumstances we find ourselves in, it does little to help our son deal with his feelings.If we can manage to regulate our frustration, a better response is to say something like: You sound really desperate to be able to see your friend. I#m guessing it is really disappointing that we have to keep apart from people we want to spend time with. You may be really cross that this virus seems to be spoiling our lives.There are a few things to notice about this response. The first is that we haven#t asked any questions about his feelings. This is because he is only nine and so he may feel put on the spotwe ask questions. If he doesn#t know how he feels, he may actually get more frustrated by being probed, since he will experience the social expectation that he should reply.Secondly, we don#t assume to know how our son is feeling. We are just guessing how he feels. So the you sound desperate... and you may be really cross... are phrased as statements and, importantly, they leave room for us to be wrong.A third thing to notice is that the statements don#t try to fix the problem created by social distancing, they simply recognise and help the child to identy, more accurately, the feelings it may create. A fourth thing you may have spotted is that the phrasing not only tries to guess at his feelings, but it also tries to guess at what may be generating those feelings . Sometimes we can be reluctant to do this, fearing that we may put ideas in their heads. However, we usually are very attuned to our children andthe thoughts are likely to be there already then it is very helpful for us, adults, to name those thoughts and feelings. If we are wrong, children still value the fact that we are trying to understand and may then be able to verbalise their actual feelings or thoughts, knowing that we have opened the door to these kinds of important conversations.There are no easy solutions to the problems or frustrations that our new way of interacting creates. But helping children to understand and voice their feelings will also help them to develop socially and emotionally.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Three days later, Corona Girl was finished and last Sunday we posted her on Facebook asking people to make bids through private message through the Zebra collectables Facebook page or telephone and whoever has bid the most by Sunday, April , will get her. We will use the money to get PPE to local places - some of whom have little or nothing and while this might not be as much as they need, it will be better than nothing.We will courier Corona Girl to whoever ends up getting her and because it has been nished she can be wiped down and disinfected.Mr Patterson saidCorona Girl garners plenty of interest he will consider making a Corona Boy that he will also auction off.He said: It is just my we and myself here now and she is keeping herself busy making hospital scrubs on her sewing machine so we are like the rest of the country - we are trying to do whatever we can to help those that need it.Belfast Most ReadFamous Northern Ireland faces share photos from past as part of latest social media crazeArrest after disturbance at Belfast shopPSNI#s George Clarke leaves force to #pursue other opportunities#DUP MLA claims republicans are intimidating businesses into coronavirus closure Elsie Frizzell, who lost her husband and daughter in IRA#s Shankill bombing, dies at  ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But what you find is that there#s a lot of misunderstanding and misperception between Belfast and Dublin. A lot of things we actually hear aren#t substantiated, they#re myths and rumours.What I found in Dublin is that there#s a lot of really good people. It#s not the cold house for unionists some would believe.I think what my two years as a senator has highlighted, especially now with coronavirus, is that we can achieve so much morewe work together and that#s in the absence of any threat to anyone#s constitutional position or identity.I don#t think Ireland is at all ready for unity but the reality is it#s a conversation that unionists need to engage in because it shouldn#t present them with any threat Ian MarshallThere#s huge opportunities to work together to drive a thriving economy across the island.And any notion that everyone in Dublin is focused on Irish unity is a misconception. There are plenty of people who support Irish unity, but there are just as many who are saying no, not at the moment. Many view it a bit like heaven, nice at some stage, just not for a while.I don#t think Ireland is at all ready for unity but the reality is it#s a conversation that unionists need to engage in because it shouldn#t present them with any threat.My future is out of my hands for now, but while I#ve left the room, I haven#t quite left the party yet. I#m still here at the door. A Taoiseach#s nomination is an option and I have forged a lot of good contacts in the last two years, done a lot of good work, so I#ll wait and see what happens next.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related ContentNorthern IrelandExcluding loyalists from united Ireland conversation could lead toto violence, says unionist senatorThe first unionist senator in the Irish Republic since the s has warned that pushing too hard for a united Ireland could cause a violent backlash from loyalists.Most ReadCoronavirus: Republic of Ireland ‘going in right direction’ with fewer Covid- cases than predictedUnionist Ian Marshall vows he won#t turn his back on Dublin after losing seat in Irish SenateProstitution offences soar by % in IrelandIreland sees highest number of deaths in a day since Covid- pandemic startedChief medical officer in hospital for tests unrelated to Covid-,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In response to a query about the work at the Sixmile Cemetery, a spokesperson for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council said yesterday: “As a council we have to fulfil our statutory duties, one of which is the provision of burials.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFreshly dug graves at Sixmile Cemetery in Antrim town FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFreshly dug graves at Sixmile Cemetery in Antrim town“We have undertaken a programme of preparatory works to ensure we can meet this requirement, particularly in the context where we might experience any reduction in cemeteries staff due to illness.”The council spokesperson did not confirm how many graves were being dug.Drone footage of the grave-digging work was posted on social media. It showed a fleet of lorries and mechanical diggers and what appear to be at least  graves being dug.Comments below the post included: “I wonder after seeing this will people stay at home.”In another video taken from the roadside and shared on social media a man can be heard to express his shock at what he is seeing.Family members are no longer able to visit the graves of loved ones at the Sixmile Cemetery and the adjacent Belmont Cemetery. Only two people and a member of the clergy are allowed to attend funerals.Other than for burials, cemeteries will be closed. The erection of headstones has also been suspended until further notice.The council said on its website that it “understands that these restrictions will be very dficult for people who have lost loved ones, but we all must play our part in stopping the spread of this virus”.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: Grim outlook as lines of graves are dug in Northern Ireland cemeteryTrump says PM’s coronavirus approach could have been ‘very catastrophic’Coronavirus: Grim outlook as lines of graves are dug in Northern Ireland cemeteryBAT claims Covid- vaccine breakthrough using tobacco plantsScotland’s Covid- death rate will be lower, expert suggests,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On the contrary, the projections underline that the continuation ofrigorous social distancing will save many lives and protect our health service from collapse. googletag.cmd.push “Even then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le In Northern Ireland. “In addition, the absence of a vaccine means we will have to plan for a potential second wave of Covid- cases later in the year.” The modelling outcome sets out a reasonable worst case scenario, based on a number of assumptions including social distancing measures producing a % reduction in contacts outside the home and workplace. In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation. The modelling team’s best judgement is that this would lead to a peak number of  Covid- patients requiring ventilation and critical care beds during the first wave of the epidemic. The peak number of Covid- hospital admissions would be  per week. googletag.cmd.push Under this reasonable worst case scenario, the projected number of cumulative Covid- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The modelling indicates that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic is expected between - April . The modelling team authors emphasise that the work is not a prediction or forecast, rather a model for planning purposes and also state: “It is assumed that current restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future. When the current restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second wave. Future modelling will focus on the size and shape of this depending on how when restrictions are relaxed or re-introduced. This will remain the case until there is substantial population immunity either as a result of recovery from infection or successful vaccination.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Foyle MLA said:Many Northern Ireland businesses are struggling to survive the coronavirus pandemic. The British government put in place emergency measures, which should assist them. These measures are welcome, however many businesses are coming to me and saying that they are having serious dficulty in accessing these schemes in the way they are supposed to operate.” I have written to Economy Minister, DianeDoddsMLA asking her to press the UK government to urgently stress to banks across theUK that they must do more to enable local businesses to access the funds they need. Many businesses will struggle to survive this pandemicwe do not act quickly. We are dealing with a health emergency, but it is fast becoming an economic emergency.” googletag.cmd.push In the letter, the Foyle MLA says she received representations from several businesses in recent days, who have expressed concern at the responses from banks in Northern Irelandregardingthe operation of UK government support schemes.Those concerns include banks tellingbusinesses they can only access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemethey fail to meet criteria for a loan from that bank under normal lending terms, which may be signicantly more expensive and which the business may not wish to engage in. A number of banks have told businesses they are not engaging in the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, or are only doing so for sums much less than the poundm maximum specied by the government. googletag.cmd.push Many businesses are too large to access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, but not large enough to access the Bank of England scheme for larger companies. Some banks are only considering applications under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme from existing customers. In addition, businesses - and homeowners with mortgages - who are being given holidays on loan repayments, but no extension on theof term of the repayment, are finding they are faced by higher monthly repayments at the end of the crisis, when they are still likely to be struggling financially.We believe that these are systemic problems with the government’s measures of support, which need to be addressed by the UK government with participating banks and building societies. It is our understanding that these problems are not unique to Northern Ireland and are the same for businesses operating in Great Britain, the SDLP representative added.Indeed, Lord Leigh of Hurley has made similar points in relation to the attitude of banks in Great Britain. He has issued a statement saying:“I am hearing that the banks are being very uncooperative. They have been seeking personal guarantees, although some have now relented. I have heard of one bank who told a customer that although their turnover was below poundm they had more than  employees and were therefore ineligible. Likewisestart upsand new tech companies will never get it as they have no profit history, indeed some no revenue yet!Clearly the banks are not keen on these loans. They would rather encourage customers to take a regular product, on which of course they can charge fees as opposed to the CBLS.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

cook everything, not just heating beans in a microwave or a boiling an egg but proper gravy with stock and cornflour.So wondering what to do with your children this week. … there’s your answer.Mum also said that meal times were much more family times, when everyone would come together, sit together and talk, sounds great to me.We are all so busy now that I wonder, when did you last sit at the table together and talk - so another good point.What about home grown food too - we used to eat a lot of this but as le has got busier this skill seems to have faded away, is this the perfect time to order seeds or shoots to plant and grow potatoes, peas, beetroot, onions, peppers or tomatoes  I remember my mum teaching me the games she used to play, so why not teach your children too - great excuse to turn the TV or computer off and play.What about Pick Up Sticks, Cat’s Cradle, Marbles, Jacks, Dominos and Cascading Dominos, or card games such as Chase The Ace, Cheat or the Matching Memory Game or even building with the cards.For outside, what about Hop Scotch, skipping rhymes and games with a skipping rope or two tennis balls against a wall - A Sailor Went To See See See, To See What He Could See, See See .. the song went on and you had to do the actions whilst still throwing and catching the two balls.Or another, sing “Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, next door neighbour carry on” and your friend would move in catching and throwing the balls without breaking the rhythm.Or try clapping games together like Say Say My Playmate.Or making obstacle courses or dens - children of any age love dens especiallythey can have lunch in there too.And do you remember making perfume from flower petals or paper mache Or on wet days what about learning to knit, or do knitting dolly, sew, crochet or even try tongue twisters, Betty Botter bought some butter but she said this butters bitter,I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter, so she bought a bit of butter better than the bitter butter and she put it in her batter and her batter was not bitter, so twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter .Don’t forget the board games too like Cludo or Mouse Trap, Ludo or Snakes And Ladders - maybe you could make the boards yourselves too!In the olden days we used to write to each other too - not email, text, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram!So why not encourage, or help, your child to discover the enjoyment of writing and receiving letters They could write about the fun you’ve been having whilst you are offand maybe include a picture they’ve done, then pop it in the post to their friends, grandparents or other family members We used to get pocket money for ‘jobs’ we did too - not just pocket money for the sake of it!Maybe your children could earn pocket moneyby washing the car, fence painting or weeding .So the ‘olden days’ sound like they had a lot to offer, they’ve also got your history too, why not investigate and create a family tree or look up what used to be in your area - what did it look like a  years ago, what did schools and homes look like and transport too, what did people do for fun, apart from the above of course.In doing and enjoying all these ‘olden day’ activities maybe you’ll inspire your child with a love of history, a love of finding out, a love of baking, cooking, gardening and maybe, most importantly of all, a love of being in a family where people talk and play and enjoying being together.P.S. in the olden days many people would have just put baby in a pram in the garden - don’t do this.And young toddlers and young children were cared for and played with by older children and teenagers - do do this and have some peace!Have a safe and healthy week everyone x. googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

In addition to Colum Cille’s own foundations at Derry and Durrow, these monasteries all looked to Iona as their leader.They adhered to the traditions of the Irish church.These Columban monasteries played a leading role in the expansion of Christianity they converted the Picts and restored Christianity to Anglo-Saxon Northumbria in the th century.In the second half of the th century Iona was at the height of its prestige – the laws of Colum Cille held sway in Ireland, with the abbots of Iona making frequent trips there.This period of Columban expansion resulted in the appearance of two art forms to Irish monasteries namely, high crosses and illuminated manuscripts.The fusion of Irish techniques of timber construction and Northumbrian skills in stone carving resulted in the appearance of highly decorated standing crosses in Irish monasteries from the second half of the th century.These elaborate high crosses with the wheel head design, in which a circle surrounded the point of intersection, developed from the earlier simple pillar stones of the th century on which crosses were incised.In the monastery at Derry there would now have appeared intricate high crosses on which scenes from the Bible were sculptured.The purpose of the crosses ied. Some marked burials, others signied a boundary of some sort, while others acted as focuses of prayer.Distinctive manuscripts on parchment were now being produced in Columban monasteries.Sometime between  and  the Book of Kells, a brilliantly illuminated copy of the four gospels with Latin text, known as “the Great Gospel of Columkille”, was written.Its precise origin is unknown not every monastery could produce such highly decorated and, at the same time, legible and correct copies of gospels written in Latin.Undoubtedly it was written in a Columban monastery, as they were famed for their teaching of Latin and the classics and for the skills of their craftsmen and artists.It was unlikely to have been written in Derry, as the team of scribes and artists required to produce such a masterpiece probably only existed at the monastic centre of the Columban confederation, which was Iona to  and subsequently Kells in central Ireland.The contents of the th century library and scriptorium at Derry have not survived.Colum Cille, according to the Annals of Clonmacnoise, wrote  books, all copies of the New Testaments. Copies were left with each of his churches, which, of course, included Derry.The earliest surviving decorated Irish manuscript is the Cathach or Battle Book, a copy of the psalms, which according to tradition was written by Colum Cille towards the end of the th century.It was handed down in the family of Conall Gulban, i.e. Colum Cille’s kin, and it was always carried three times round the army to ensure victory before they went into battle.Illumination in this manuscript was confined to the fine large capital letters at the beginning of each psalm.With the Book of Durrow, a copy of the four gospels written in the mid-th century, an Irish style had emerged in which at the beginning of each gospel there was on the left a full ornamented page, brilliantly coloured, with intricate designs of spirals and interlocking animals and plants while on the right there was an introductory page beginning with a large, beautully proportioned, capital letter. In addition, portraits or symbols were used to depict each of the four evangelists.The Book of Kells marked the pinnacle of Irish achievement in manuscript production, with its profusion of illustration, colour and ornamentation, and its repeated use of the same symbols for the four evangelists a man for Matthew, a lion for Mark, a calf for Luke and an eagle for John.By the end of the th century the monastic settlement at Derry would have changed little.The monastic complex would still have been made of timber.The only new physical feature would have been the erection of a few high stone crosses.The scriptorium may have begun to produce some basic illuminated manuscripts, similar to the Cathach. It would, of course, have continued to make straight copies of the psalms and gospels.In  a fleet of ships, the like of which had never been seen before, sailed up Lough Foyle.These ships, built of oak, some over  feet long and  feet wide, and steered by a rudder paddle, were powered by both oar and sail.From  feet pine masts fluttered square sails of double-thickness strips of red and white woven cloth, and, from behind rows of shields slung over the side, men, up to  on each boat, pulled on narrow-bladed spruce oars and manoeuvred the boats into the sheltered waters of the River Foyle.They beached their boats, which drew only three feet of water, on the shore beneath the monastery.From the boats men rushed up the hill, the leaders wearing protective coats of mail and helmets with a nose piece which projected down over the face the rest, following close behind, in thick woollen coats which reached half way down their thighs.They all carried a round wooden shield, many of which were painted either yellow or black.The long, broad, two-edged iron sword and the long-handled, broad-edged battle axe were the principal weapons they carried.Some were armed with spears, others with bow and arrows. Most had an iron kne, with a wood or bone handle, tucked in their belts.The Vikings had located the monastic settlement at Derry, and, as where in Ireland and Britain, they met no organised resistance.They burnt the abbey and massacred her clergy and students.Not only was the monastery an easy target to attack because of its secluded, yet very accessible, location, it was also a very rewarding one.Derry was a centre of wealth, rich in lands and livestock.The Vikings were interested in food provisions, to sustain further voyages, as well as in the precious metal ornaments associated with a monastery.They were also interested in taking prisoners, especially girls, as they had been trading in human slaves to central Europe for centuries.The Vikings never attempted to settle in Derry.In  they again attacked, but this time they were driven back, with great losses, by Niall Caille, King of Ireland and Murchadh, Prince of Aileach.Derry continued to be attractive to Viking invaders throughout the th century.In  the shrine of Colum Cille was carried away by the Vikings. In  and  she was again plundered.Derry’s long-term growth did not suffer because of the Viking raids,anything it increased.With the Viking raids on Iona in ,  and , the monks acquired a site at Kells in central Ireland, and, bearing the relics of Colum Cille, moved there to found a new monastery.There was a steady rise in the status and importance of Derry from , as she succeeded Iona and then Kells as the centre of all Columban foundations in Ireland and Scotland.By the end of the th century Derry was known as Doire Columcille, as opposed to Doire Calgach.This Viking period resulted in two new additions to the monastery at Derry: her first stone church and a round tower.Sometime after the first raid in , the wooden church, which the Vikings burnt, was replaced with a stone one.It would have been a simple building, similar in shape to its wooden predecessors.This stone single-chamber church, later known as Dubh Regles or Black Abbey church, was perhaps no longer than  feet.It probably had one narrow slit for a window, and was roofed with stone to simulate overlapping tiles. Housing for the monks and their tenant farmers was still made of the traditional wood and wattle combination.Sometime between the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century, a round tower of stone was built next to the Black Abbey church to serve a iety of purposes, such as a belfry, a watch tower and a place of refuge.Perhaps  feet high and  feet in diameter, with five floors, each lit by one window except the top which had four, entrance was gained,  feet above ground level, by a movable ladder.Inside, each wooden floor was linked by a wooden staircase. If set on fire this tower would have been a death trap, as the up-draught working on ignited wooden floors would have created an inferno.By the turn of the th century Derry was beginning to see a revival in its fortunes as an important monastic town.Apart from the additions of elaborate stone crosses, a small dry-stone church and a round tower, Derry was still very similar to the settlement founded in . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

John Wade works in St Jerome Bilingual School in Harrow, London and has put together learning packs for all year groups, from Primary  to Primary . “I started offering free resources to try and help parents out,” he told Derry Now. “I’m teaching in a school, but I also do some tutoring online and on a one-to-one basis as well. “Everyone was really worried about their children not being able to go to school and even when the schools were still open, they were pulling them out. googletag.cmd.push “There is only so much the schools can do, so I’ve put these packs together from Primary  right through to Primary . It’s just a way of trying to help people out. “ The rapidly moving situation has caused confusion in all schools across the UK but John says the school have been supportive, especially with him being away from home. “I was worried about trying to get home at Easter to see family but the school I’m in have been brilliant, they’ve advised us as much as we can. “No one really knew what was going on. It’s been hectic because you’re trying to get things ready for the children in school as well and then you didn’t knowit was closing or not. googletag.cmd.push “It’s really dficult because even the headteachers don’t know what’s going on. It’s important that parents understand that schools are doing their best to react too.” Any parents interested in John’s resources can get in touch through his Facebook page John Wade Primary Tutoring.

Vincent Rainey, from Dunloy, Co Antrim, began hosting the quizzes from his Facebook page last week, with much of the country already in self-imposed lockdown. The mortgage advisor says the idea stemmed from a throwaway comment while enjoying a glass of wine with his family to relieve the boredom of lockdown. He said: “Catherine, Lauren and I were having a chat over a glass of wine. “Quizzes are my hobby and I just had this random notion about doing a live broadcast, which I’d never done before.” googletag.cmd.push Engagement was central in Vincent’s thinking when building the idea. He wanted to ensure that those living in isolation, particularly those living alone, had access to some interaction. He said: “A lot of people are on their own and I want to try and make sure that they are socially involved, particularly those people who are really on their own. “It’s about figuring out ways for people to communicate with their friends and family, so they are not isolated.” The quiz was launched on Saturday, March  and over  people tuned into the online broadcast, but Vincent says he had a bit of homework to do before he got going. googletag.cmd.push “I YouTubed it,” he admits. “I have loads of content, having done this for a number of years, but I’d never done a live feed, so I had to figure out even how to do that!” The Dunloy man says the experience of hosting an online quiz is a dferent experience for someone used to the more social environment of a pub or hall. “I was quite apprehensive doing it online for the first time,” he said. “In a pub, or on a stage, you can gauge your audience, so you knowthey’re engaged. You can tell by body language their level of interest. “The only way you can check online is through comments and reactions, but that’s good because you want to know you’re not making a complete ass of yourself!” Watching along in another room in the house is Vincent’s we Catherine and daughter Lauren, and with the help of technology, son Josh joins them from Canada. “We just go into a dferent room and it all works well,” said Catherine. “Our son lives in Winnipeg, Canada and got in touch through Facebook Messenger. On one phone we had the quiz coming up and on the other we had a live chat open with Josh. “That conversation makes things much easier and much more satisfying. You can see the other person’s face and engage. The quiz’s reach is growing steadily, with Saturday night engaging over  eager participants, and Vincent is beginning to reach a global audience from his kitchen. He said: “I saw messages from New York, Houston in Texas and there was someone  joining in from Chicago, so there is beginning to be an international feel.” You can increase the Derry contingent by getting involved. See details of the next online quiz by visiting Vincent’s Facebook page.

Caitriacuteona Lagan, from Castledawson, won the U All-Ireland mandolin title at the  Fleadh in Drogheda and is usually found playing at a session every weekend. Due to the measures in place to curb the spread of coronavirus, however, she has ploughed her efforts into performing online and sharing much-needed positivity. Caitriacuteona told the County Derry Post that it was vital to keep people’s spirits up at this time. She said: “I think it’s very important to keep playing because it can cheer people up and help them to take their minds off things. It makes them feel better. googletag.cmd.push “It’s nice to keep children happy and, instead of all the technology, give them something  to do as well.” The -year-old recently posted a video of her playing a few tunes for the children of Kilronan Special School in Magherafelt. Her mother, Roisiacuten, said Caitriacuteona had a great fondness for the children at Kilronan, having held charity events and performed there before. She said: “After she won the All-Ireland, we didn’t really get a chance to play any events, so for her th birthday she wanted to have a big session. “We don’t have any connections with Kilronan or anything, but she had met a few children at sessions who went to it. googletag.cmd.push “She did a charity night and then was invited up to the school and the summer scheme, so she’s been up and they know her. “She decided, in order to keep her practice up, she would share some videos online. It’s a good way for her to practise and it’s good for her confidence too. One thing that Caitriacuteona will miss out on this year is the annual series of Fleadhanna – county, provincial and All-Ireland – which have had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus. She said: “I’m a wee bit disappointed because I love going to the festivals because the atmosphere is so good at them. “I’m using the time to catch up with my schoolwork, take my dogs for a walkI can, do a wee bit of painting, bake at some point, practise my music. “I play a few dferent instruments – banjo, mandolin, fiddle, guitar and piano.” Caitriacuteona’s mum Roisiacuten said that social media has been a godsend for the music community during this time. “At the minute it’s the only way people are able to connect. A lot of Caitriacuteona’s friends would be in the music scene, and she would be at sessions every week, so she’s missing that. “With the Fleadh not being on this year, there’s going to be a massive gap. We normally plan our whole year around the fleadh, so the music is great for everyone to keep spirits up.” Caitriacuteona is certainly helping to keep spirits up, and Roisiacuten said a few children had already been in touch via social media. “A wee boy this morning sent her a rainbow, so hopefully they keep coming and keep children and adults occupied.” You can keep up to date with Caitriacuteona’s videos via her Twitter and Facebook accounts.

In recent days, the debate around essential services has been widely raised with no further clarity emerging for businesses and employees. Chief Executive of the Londonderry Chamber, Paul Clancy said: “The situation is getting more confusing by the day. We have had many businesses in the North West impacted because of this confusion. The supply chain to all essential services is broad and it incorporates a vast number of companies in many sectors. “Take for example the food supply chain. That does not just consist of places that produce foodstuffs, but there is also a huge supply chain supporting it from those that produce agricultural products, oil companies for heating and keeping lorries on roads, food labelling and packaging, to distribution. If one of these links is broken, it will have an impact on the end product we have on our supermarket shelves. googletag.cmd.push “We must stop demonising businesses for trying to keep essential work going during this crisis and instead work with them to ensure they can keep the business going, whilst also ensuring the safety of employees. “Maintaining essential supplies will protect public confidence that we can feed the nation whilst everyone  is told to stay at home and fight this virus. “We urge the Executive to show leadership and work effectively with businesses and workers to outline what are essential businesses. The establishment of a forum on workplace safety is welcome but we need to see decisions and guidance. With every day that passes, more essential businesses are forced to close.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The council today said there has been an increased pressure on its collections as a result of the current coronavirus crisis. A council spokesperson said: “Our refuse collection service continues to remain operational and we are seeing an increase in calls and queries relating to waste management and are currently looking at a bespoke COVID- waste response mechanism that could assist in dealing with this increased pressure on waste services. “This is currently being scoped out and in the interim period the public are being asked to work with Council to try not to put additional pressure on waste services during this emergency period.” googletag.cmd.push The council said people can help by doing the following: - Please leave your bins out for collection at an earlier time of am to allow crews to get around all households. - Please do not leave out black bags - Council cannot collect additional black bags left beside bins, please use the blue, black and brown bins provided appropriately, making sure to separate waste as usual according to recycling guidelines and dispose of waste responsibly. - You should have adequate bin capacity as long as you are not dumping unnecessary additional items. Please do not put additional pressure on Council waste services resources and staff during this emergency period. googletag.cmd.push To assist the council to limit the spread of the virus, they would encourage the public to • Clean the lids and handles of bins before and after collection. • Dispose of tissues and disposable cleaning wipes separately placing them in two plastic bags, tying and storing inside for  days before putting in the external black bin. • Place all food waste in compostable bags and ensure that they are tied before putting in your BROWN BIN. • Bring bins out either the night before their scheduled collection day or before am on collection day. • Park considerately so lorries can access streets to service bins.

The council today said there has been an increased pressure on its collections as a result of the current coronavirus crisis. A council spokesperson said: “Our refuse collection service continues to remain operational and we are seeing an increase in calls and queries relating to waste management and are currently looking at a bespoke COVID- waste response mechanism that could assist in dealing with this increased pressure on waste services. “This is currently being scoped out and in the interim period the public are being asked to work with Council to try not to put additional pressure on waste services during this emergency period.” googletag.cmd.push The council said people can help by doing the following: - Please leave your bins out for collection at an earlier time of am to allow crews to get around all households. - Please do not leave out black bags - Council cannot collect additional black bags left beside bins, please use the blue, black and brown bins provided appropriately, making sure to separate waste as usual according to recycling guidelines and dispose of waste responsibly. - You should have adequate bin capacity as long as you are not dumping unnecessary additional items. Please do not put additional pressure on Council waste services resources and staff during this emergency period. googletag.cmd.push To assist the council to limit the spread of the virus, they would encourage the public to • Clean the lids and handles of bins before and after collection. • Dispose of tissues and disposable cleaning wipes separately placing them in two plastic bags, tying and storing inside for  days before putting in the external black bin. • Place all food waste in compostable bags and ensure that they are tied before putting in your BROWN BIN. • Bring bins out either the night before their scheduled collection day or before am on collection day. • Park considerately so lorries can access streets to service bins.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres.

It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

Godrsquos love goes on. Godrsquos love never ends and He can use each of us in this time of crisis. Let us remember that God desires to be with us in this storm. Let us remember it will pass and let us ask Him for his saving help to overcome all the trials.ldquoAt this time, we are reminded the word corona is Latin for crown.Let us remember that Christians trust in Christ the King, who wears the crown of salvation and is the author of le.While the clergy share the sorrow that church services cannot proceed in public, some services are still being offered online via Facebook, live video or recorded on YouTube. There are also blogs, and other resources.They said: ldquoEveryone is welcome to watch and pray and have spiritual communion and draw le from the word of God.ldquoWherever possible, come and join us online and on Facebook and worship in spirit and in truth. Watching television and radio incessantly can lead to anxiety and stress.ldquoPrayer and worship offer a healing alternative. We need to take time to focus on the Good News. And that is the saving message of Christ Jesus. Prayer is good for the soul. We are body and soul. And we need that spiritual help that comes from prayer and faith. God is constantly telling us not to be afraid, that He is with us.ldquoHe reminds us to turn away from our sin, our  gods and to turn to Him for help. He speaks of His faithfulness, His constant and everlasting love.ldquoIn times like this, we see very clearly that the distractions from God, such as money or endless entertainment, cannot save us, cannot satisfy us. We need God in our lives to strengthen us, comfort us, forgive us and nourish our hearts and drooping spirits.The clergymen said ure reminded people not to take more than they need, that the Lord provides enough for each day.ldquoLet us guard against selfishness and, like the Hebrews, who received manna from Heaven, only take what we need for the day. This is a demonstration of real love, putting God and other people first.They pointed out that St Patrick, faced many hardships, isolation, helplessness, cold, hunger, sickness and many times, the threat of death.They recalled that it was in captivity and isolation that the young Patrick grew close to God, having arrived in Ireland a teenager with no real faith in what he had been taught by his Christian parents.ldquoIn his famous Confession, Patrick wrote that in his suffering he became aware of his lack of faith. He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre. There is only God. There is no other saviour. We are people of the cross. But we are people of the resurrection too.

We will also continue to engage with the local sector and keep them informed as the situation evolves.The suspension of driving tests runs from Monday of this week to until June , with the decision kept under review.Ms Mallon said people who have a driving test scheduled during this period will have the test rescheduled or may apply for a refund.She continued: ldquoThe DVA will issue clear instructions in the coming days advising candidates of next steps and updates around the re-starting of driving tests and details will be published online on nidirect.ldquoWe are experiencing an unprecedented and fast-evolving situation. In line with the current guidance, it is necessary to adopt these measures to protect customers, staff and to allow the DVA to prioritise essential services. These measures will be kept under review and updated as necessary.The infrastructure minister said while the current circumstances are ldquoexceptional, in relation to emergency workers and essential service drivers needing a driving test, the DVA will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate these customers.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI would encourage the public to continue to do what they can to delay the spread of the virus and follow the latest advice from the Public Health Agency.ldquoI know this is a frightening time for people, but want to reassure them that within my Department and working with all government departments, we will continue to do all we can to keep people safe.Further information about the suspension of driving tests and how to apply for an emergency driving test will be provided over the coming days..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Shutters.jpg","title":"Shutters go down in towns  ","story":"THE people of the district have been given an unequivocal message this week to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus mdash stay at home.A series of unprecedented measures announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday night will see town centres deserted, with businesses having to comply with a stringent lockdown set to be in force for the foreseeable future as the battle against coronavirus enters a crucial new stage.The sweeping measures aimed at preventing the spread of the disease are to be reviewed in three weeksrsquo time.

That’s a good direction of travel.”He said “travelling long distances to go for your daily exercise is not essential and therefore you shouldn’t be doing it”.When it was put to him that the actual wording of the regulations do not permit him to enforce that, ACC Todd said: “It depends on how you read the legislation...on one reading of it, no you shouldn’t under the law be travelling distances in order to take your exercise”.But he said the police did not want to get involved with the “fine minutiae”.He said he was concerned thatmany people do turn up to beauty spots, then “police have to step in to prevent crowds gathering” .PSNI headquarters later went on to say: “There is no confusion on the part of police. The very simple health advice is to stay at home and you should only leave home when it is absolutely essential.”The set of legal rules governing what people can and cannot do in Northern Ireland is called The Health ProtectionRegulations.It has been in force since pm on Saturday – three days after the rest of the UK.It provides a list of that things count as “reasonable excuses” for leaving the house.Specically it says this “includes the need”: lTo get food and medical suppliesand supplies for “essential upkeep” of the home, or to “obtain money”l To exercise alone or with a member of the householdl For medical helpand to provide care to the vulnerablel To give bloodl For work or to volunteer l To attend funerals ofpeople you live with or close family– or “ no-one within sub-paragraphsoris attending, a friend”l For the purpose of legal proceedings, answering bail, or otherwise “fulfil a legal obligation”l To access “crucial public services” l Where a parent or parents and children live apart, to continue existing arrangements for contact between parents and childrenl To move housel To visit churches l And to avoid injury, illness or harm.Meanwhile gatherings of two-plus people are banned unless they:l Involve people of the same householdl Are essential for workl To attend a funerall To facilitate a house movel To participate in legal proceedings, or fulfil a legal obligationl Are to provide care to the vulnerable or emergency helpWHAT ARE THE PENALTIES :Under the regulations, enforcement is down to the PSNI or perople “designated by the Department of Health”.They can hand out fixed-penalties of £ , and rising to £ for repeat offendersUltimately, offenders can accumulate fixed penalty fines capped at the level of £.The PSNI can order someone home, or take them home using “reasonable force”If they fail to obey, they will be committing an offenceThey can be convicted and fined in court up to a maximum of £, \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Lurgan man Geoff Gates, who has created the Limitless weight loss programme, believes people shouldn’t use lockdown as an excuse to adopt a poor diet and exercise routine.He said: “The Limitless philosophy has always been that the only reason people get stuck in a rut is because of their limiting beliefs. If you feel good through proper nutrition and smart exercise, you will naturally be drawn towards better lestyle choices.”At times of great stress, for many diet often goes out the window. Geoff shared his advice on how to eat well during a crisis: “The issue here is we need to be not using food to combat stress but instead, tackle the stress head-on, that’s the first step. “I get all my clients to start practising meditation immediately. When I first suggest meditation to someone, they often wonderI’m joking or being serious. It’s not some hippy-dippy woo-woo thing, this is a proper prescription. They often report profound changes almost immediately.”Geoff said that having been overweight and depressed himself helped him to create Limitless: “There is gold in the depths of despair, and I count my experience as a blessing now. Without my personal struggle, I could never have developed the techniques to create the best weight loss programme in the world.”He said in terms of nutrition it was important to focus on quality food: “Broccoli is especially good for the lungs and its funny that it looks like a lung, just like walnuts a great for brain health they look like a little brain. As bizarre as this may sound, I believe our creator has provided us with clues.”Geoff said the current situation makes it even more important to make shopping lists, especially now that visits to the shops are meant to be limited. He commented: “There are always ways to make healthy food convenient food. We all own a freezer, so it’s just a matter of being a little bit smart and preparing ahead. “I advise my coaching clients to buy freezer bags then put all the ingredients together in the bag and use as and when they need them.”In terms of exercise he said: “I don’t think it’s been more relevant to use our time to focus on our health and fitness. The most used excuse I have heard continuously through my  years in the fitness industry was that people didn’t have time. Now we have an abundance of it. “So now you have plenty of time the next excuse will be that you don’t have the equipment. I refuse to hear it. “The simple truth is we don’t need gyms and never have needed them. The way I see it is the gyms have been a luxury, not a necessity. “The misconception is that you cannot get strong, fit and healthy without one – the truth being you can get the same results with just your good self, become your own gym.”He added: “If I was going to advise on one piece of home equipment it would be an adjustable set of dumbbells. He suggested a quickfire lockdown workout could include  bodyweight squats,  star jumps,  straight punches,  upper cuts,  push ups and  mountain climbers.He said those conscious of social distancing could exercise earlier to avoid encountering other people: “I have always got up at am to train so when I am out running in the morning, there is no one about. For me, being outside when no one is around is perfectly acceptable. We need fresh air.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Health Minister Robin Swann has set out key findings of an expert NI modelling study, which will inform intensive hospital planning for the forthcoming surge in COVID- cases. “In summary, the research indicates that our health service would have a realistic prospect of coping in this initial perioda sufficient proportion of the population adhere to the social distancing and self-isolation measures,” Mr Swann said. “However, it is important that this is considered in context, and I would emphasise that it provides no grounds whatsoever for dropping our guard. On the contrary, the projections underline that the continuation of rigorous social distancing will save many lives and protect our health service from collapse. “Even then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le In Northern Ireland. “In addition, the absence of a vaccine means we will have to plan for a potential second wave of COVID- cases later in the year.” The modelling outcome sets out a reasonable worst case scenario, based on a number of assumptions including social distancing measures producing a % reduction in contacts outside the home and workplace. In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation. The modelling team’s best judgement is that this would lead to a peak number of  COVID- patients requiring ventilation and critical care beds during the first wave of the epidemic. The peak number of COVID- hospital admissions would be  per week. Under this reasonable worst case scenario, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The modelling indicates that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic is expected between - April . The modelling team authors emphasise that the work is not a prediction or forecast, rather a model for planning purposes and also state: “It is assumed that current restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future. When the current restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second wave. Future modelling will focus on the size and shape of this depending on how when restrictions are relaxed or re-introduced. This will remain the case until there is substantial population immunity either as a result of recovery from infection or successful vaccination.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_caebcfeeced   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_aaaffcdbffdacc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
