Supply shortage worries should also be easing, after America’s largest fuel pipeline restarted operations nearly a week after a cyber-attack forced it to shut (which pushed up prices of crude and refined petroleum, amid a dash to the pumps) Copper prices also dipped, having also hit record highs last week. They’re being pulled down by a strengthening US dollar, which jumped yesterday after US inflation hit its highest since 2008.With the holiday season approaching, Britain’s competition watchdog has warned package companies to promptly refund holidaymakers whose trips are cancelled due to the pandemic. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has written to UK travel firms to remind them of their legal obligations, insisting they ensure refund options are clear and accessible. The CMA was deluged by complaints last year when the pandemic hit, from people saying they’d been refused refunds when holidays were cancelled, or pressured into taking vouchers instead. In a clear warning shot, the CMA reminds holiday firms that it will act if companies breaking the law by refusing or delaying refunds this summer. Under the law: Holiday group TUI - one of several major holiday firms investigated by the CMA last year - has given a formal pledge to provide clearer information on refunds upfront to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus. BT said it would consider a joint venture partnership to fund the rollout to the extra 5m homes. The company has pledged £12bn to address the UK’s status as a global laggard in full-fibre broadband, and fulfil Boris Johnson’s election promise of getting next-generation broadband speeds to all homes in the UK. Philip Jansen, the chief executive of BT, says: Burberry, known for its trench coats and distinctive patterned goods, explains:  Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, adds: Burberry says it will be reducing markdowns (discounts) in its mainstream stores, as it focuses on full-price sales - which will drag on sales growth. “Ballooning losses overnight in the US, and a tough session in Asia” are weighing on the markets, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx, The blue-chip index dropped by around 100 points at the open, to as low as 6902 points - its lowest level in almost three weeks. Inflation worries continue to grip the markets today, after US consumer prices jumped much more sharply than expected in April amid supply shortages and rising demand as lockdowns ease. It triggered Wall Street losses last night, and in Asia-Pacific bourses where shares fell for the third day running. With government support packages driving consumer spending, and stretched supply chains creating a scramble for raw materials, investors are concerned that the jump in inflation may not be temporary as the Federal Reserve believes. Some economists, though, point out that US inflation was driven up by one-off factors as the economy emerged from pandemic restrictions, so it could be a temporary spike. Used car and truck prices, shelter and lodging, airline tickets, recreational activities, car insurance and furniture all pushed CPI higher, as the reopening of businesses created temporary quirks in the data. New US producer prices data, and weekly jobless claims are due today - which will give new insight into how the world’s largest economy is faring. It will take time to tell if inflation is transitory or permanent, so this issue is going to loom for months.

Noirmoutier circuitsAccessed along a paved causeway, the tidal isle of Noirmoutier is famed for the mimosa trees found amid its superb sandy beaches, salt marshes and oak forests. Three designated riding loops navigate the isle’s varied terrain – with the most central circuit also yielding such quaint villages as windmill-speckled La Guérinière. The cycle routes can be completed in one day or, if you prefer, at a more leisurely pace over successive days.  Noirmoutier is a three-hour drive from Saint-Malo’s ferry port, accessible via Brittany Ferries – allowing travellers to easily get to north-western France in the comfort and safety of their own car. 2. The Jade CoastAround a third of La Vélodyssée, France’s longest cycle route at more than 745 miles, is given over to the Atlantic Loire Valley region. South of Nantes (get there by train from Saint-Malo’s ferry port, via Rennes) and the Loire estuary, few trails are prettier than those tracing the 27-mile Jade Coast. Here, between Saint-Brevin-les-Pins and Bouin, riders will find rocky seascapes, broad Blue Flag shores, secret coves, traditional harbours and even the occasional bourgeois villa to admire. Dismount on Pointe Saint-Gildas, a wild headland affording fine estuary views, and look out for pêcheries: spindly little huts perched on pontoons to enable fishing with poles. The many charming resort towns, including Pornic, work well as bases thanks to their lively, strollable streets, seafood bistros and patisseries – this corner of France is the home of brioche. Thinking of seafood, the local specialties include sardines, anchovies, oysters and mussels. From the town of Ducey-les-Chéris, you’ll follow lanes with little traffic through woods, arable pastures and sleepy villages – vintage rural France, in other words. After a few hours and possibly a picnic, the Unesco-listed Mont-Saint-Michel will appear, with that marvellous, abbey-topped citadel. Out on the tidal island, the restaurant La Ferme St Michel majors in fresh, local products – think roasted apple with camembert and cacouyard or terrine of salt-meadow lamb. Rejuvenated? Then either continue onwards for 42 miles along the Vélomaritime past swimmable coves to reach Brittany Ferries’ port of Saint-Malo (in Brittany), or turn back and spend two days pedalling beside bocage-hedgerow landscapes north to Cherbourg. 4. Longues to ArromanchesEast of Cherbourg’s ferry port, the Vélomaritime route descends the Cotentin peninsula’s gorgeous reaches and passes all five of Normandy’s D-day landing beaches – offering a chance to combine cycling with fascinating, vital history. The five-mile route follows greenways from Longues-sur-Mer, crossing the cliffs above Gold beach to Arromanches-les-Bains. As it’s a short ride, there’s plenty of time to stop and take in the views whenever you like. The German battery at Longues remains well preserved, and has a visitor centre, while the British-built mulberry harbour at Arromanches also survives and houses a museum. You’ll find restaurants, too: the Cotentin is known for salt-meadow lamb while, what with this being Normandy’s calvados department, apple and pear brandies are guaranteed to be in good supply. It’s easy to explore the other D-day beaches en route as you pedal on toward the ferry port of Caen. 5. The Nantes-Brest canalLa Vélodyssée – France’s portion of the EuroVelo 1 route – starts at Roscoff, a port served by ferries from Plymouth, and takes in part of the glorious Nantes-Brest canal. The two meet just south of Carhaix-Plouguer and the partnership lasts for around 162 miles. Perfect for fun-filled family day trips by bike, the canal’s towpath promises a steady, gentle diet of barges, woodland, lakes, and locks garlanded with flowers. Especially photogenic is the steep-sided Blavet Valley, thanks chiefly to lush vegetation and imposing lock-keepers’ buildings. Kids too young to ride could perch in child seats, or you might consider hiring tandem bikes. Cycling a canal section makes for a lovely inland interruption to holidays otherwise spent exploring the sandy seasides and ancient fishing hamlets and towns around Roscoff, Quimper or Vannes. 6. Dinard to QuestembertOne of Brittany’s long-distance cycle paths – Route 3 – winds south from Dinard (a boat-hop across the Rance river from Saint-Malo), initially along the Canal d’Ille et Rance. At more than 124 miles and mostly confined to quiet roads or greenways, it’s ideal for cycling enthusiasts or families with energetic teenagers. The best section comes after Malestroit, when you’ll cross the Landes de Lanvaux’s high, open heathland riding on smooth paths. Before that, close to Mauron, the trail fringes the Forest of Brocéliande, whose Arthurian-legend locations include the Valley of No Return, the Golden Tree and – supposedly – Merlin’s Tomb, all possible ersions. It’s easy to pitch up along the way at pretty campsites such as Brocéliande’s Camping Merlin l’Enchanteur, where two swimming pools (one for kids) await. Four days is the typical Route 3 duration, but many go slow and take a week. From Questembert, trains can have you back on Saint-Malo’s beaches in a little more than two hours. The lungfuls of fresh air will continue during the ferry home too, what with so much open space both inside and out on deck.

For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top. Across the unspoilt massif, hundreds of kilometres of paths explore wooded slopes and valleys, and loop from authentic villages such as Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, a medieval town on a rocky outcrop with a ninth century chateau to visit. There’s tons for families to do too, from hiking with donkeys to high-ropes courses in the trees.

Data from NHS England also showed that the number of people having to wait more than a year to start hospital treatment stood at 436,127 in March. NHS England said the health service had seen almost a quarter of a million people with suspected cancer in March as services “began to bounce back” after the peak of the winter Covid wave. The results also suggested a strong link between vaccine hesitancy and the use of social media, particularly where social media is the main source of information, according to Eurofound which carried out the survey. “Unfortunately, these findings reflect a failure to deliver persuasive and clear communication regarding the efficacy and safety of vaccines,” said Daphne Ahrendt, Eurofound senior research manager. The survey was conducted between February and March 2021, after a full year of living with Covid-19 restrictions across the bloc’s 27 member states. As a broad caveat, historically data has tended to show that people over-estimate how reluctant they will be to take a vaccine. Our science correspondent Nicola Davis reported last night on another study which suggested that emphasising the personal benefits of vaccination against Covid may be an effective way to reduce scepticism in those most hesitant towards having a jab. Rachel Hall, meanwhile, has rounded up a fuller view on what the UK foreign office minister, James Cleverly, has said this morning about the prospects of the Covid variant first found in India delaying the lifting of England’s restrictions. I’ll be carrying on here with the latest global coronavirus news and the top Covid lines from the UK.As the deadly Covid-19 second wave has engulfed India, and ripped like wildfire through its overcrowded, under-resourced prisons, there have been growing calls for those deemed political prisoners – the activists arrested as part of prime minister Narendra Modi’s vicious crackdown on dissent – to be granted the bail they have been repeatedly denied. The impact of the pandemic on prisoners kept in jail on grounds many believe to be politically motivated has already been severe. Siddique Kappan, a Muslim journalist charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) after he was arrested last October while travelling to report on a rape incident in Uttar Pradesh, was infected with Covid-19 in jail in April. Kappan, who has diabetes, was eventually taken to hospital after collapsing, where he was kept handcuffed to a hospital bed for four days and not allowed to go to the bathroom, forced instead to urinate into a bottle. He was later discharged back to prison, still Covid-19 positive and suffering symptoms. Several anti-citizenship amendment act activists, including Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi, who are both in jail under UAPA pending trial, have also caught Covid in prison but, according to their families, been denied proper treatment. Saifi, one of the founders of the activist group United Against Hate, has been in Delhi’s Mandoli jail since his arrest in February 2020. He developed coronavirus symptoms more than 20 days ago but no tests were being done because he said prison officers were worried it would “cause trouble”. After his lawyers raised his case in court, Saifi was finally given a test and expired paracetamol. Read more of Hannah Ellis-Petersen’s report from Delhi: India – Covid anguish fuels calls to release human rights activists from jails The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Thursday said it had written to 100 package tour companies reminding them of the need to offer refunds for cancelled holidays and to pay back customers within a fortnight. The CMA warning comes as the UK government prepares to ease restrictions on holidays. From Monday 17 May travellers from England will be allowed to visit a dozen destinations on the green list, without needing to quarantine. They are Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, Israel and Portugal, including the Azores and Madeira, and two British overseas territories in the Atlantic. However, the regulator has been concerned by travel firms’ repeated failures to inform customers of their right to cash refunds if it is forced to cancel bookings. Since March 2020, the CMA has received more than 23,000 complaints from consumers about refund issues, it said. Read more of Jasper Jolly’s report here: UK package holiday operators warned over consumer refund rights Egypt received its first Covax delivery of 854,000 AstraZeneca doses at the start of April. It has also received several batches of the Sinopharm vaccine from China, bringing the total number of vaccine doses delivered to 5m, the health ministry said. Egypt, with a population of just over 100 million, is trying to contain a third wave of Covid-19 infections and the government has put in place some restrictive measures until 21 May, shortening opening hours and banning large gatherings. Some 2.7 million people have registered online with the health ministry to receive a vaccine. Egypt had officially confirmed 240,927 coronavirus cases including 14,091 deaths as of Wednesday. Officials and experts say the real number of infections is far higher, but is not reflected in government figures because of low testing rates and the exclusion of private test results.Supporters of the plan say it will strike a blow for the equitable distribution of vaccines, while pharmaceutical companies and some other governments opposed the idea, saying it would not solve global inoculation shortages. British and EU officials have been sceptical about the usefulness of the US proposal to waive patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines, while saying they are prepared to discuss it.“China supports the WTO’s proposal on IP exemptions for anti-epidemic materials such as the Covid vaccine to enter the text consultation stage,” Gao said at a news conference in Beijing, report Reuters. “China will work with all parties to actively participate in consultations and jointly promote a balanced and effective solution,” he said.China’s official vaccination figures continue to out-strip all others, with Reuters noting that they claim they administered 11.6m vaccinations on 12 May, bringing the total number of doses administered to 354m, according to data released by the National Health Commission.She has spoken to doctors, scientists and other experts to answer the big questions… Read more from Zoe Williams here: The expert guide to a horny, healthy summer “Even though we are in a state of crisis, we’re still using the same rules to approve vaccines that we do under normal times,” Kono said in a TBS television interview broadcast on Wednesday, report Reuters. “In the wake of this corona situation, the administration needs to change.” The government aims to inoculate most of its 36 million people over the age of 65 by the end of July. To reach that vaccination target, the government hopes to deliver about 1 million shots a day, about three times faster than the current pace. politan CEO Kanyenje Gakombe said the hospital accelerated plans to produce its own oxygen after supplies were squeezed to the limit during the height of the third wave, fanned by the variants of the coronavirus first detected in Britain and South Africa. At the peak of Kenya’s third wave of Covid-19 in March, hospitals - buckling under the strain of the virus - saw their oxygen reserves fizzle out. Since then, they have been scrambling to increase capacity, fearing the nightmare scenario currently unfolding in India due to oxygen shortages. “The reserve dwindled, it decreased to the point where we were collecting oxygen 247,” recalled Gakombe. At one point “we were down to six hours of reserves and that was a very, very worrying situation.” The grey-haired doctor admits that in his 27 years at the helm of the 150-bed private institution that targets the middle class, he had rarely worried about the oxygen supply which was “something we took for granted”. But where a typical patient uses “two to 15 litres” of oxygen per minute, a Covid patient requires “up to 60 litres”, he said. “We wanted to make sure we were self-sufficient, not dependent on third parties to provide us with the oxygen we needed,” he said. Several other private hospitals in Nairobi, like the MP Shah facility, have also set up or expanded their own production units. “We have received several requests for different facilities,” said Jeremy Gitau, co-founder of the Emergency Medicine Kenya Foundation, which helps Kenyan hospitals equip themselves with oxygen distribution systems. Meanwhile the government launched a call for tenders at the beginning of March to supply 16 counties with oxygen, and has urged the repair of numerous production units that are “no longer working”.Tens of thousands of Cambodians are going hungry under the country’s strict lockdown as Covid cases continue to rise amid criticism from human rights groups that the government and the UN are being too slow to act. The south-east Asian country had recorded one of the world’s smallest coronavirus caseloads, but infections have climbed from about 500 in late February to 20,695 this week, with 136 deaths. A three-week blanket lockdown in the capital, Phnom Penh, was lifted last week but more than 150,000 people are still living in designated red zones in cities across Cambodia, forbidden from leaving their homes other than for specific medical reasons. Many have been living under the country’s most restrictive lockdown measures since mid-April and have not been able to work or get food, medicine and other necessities for weeks. “This is a humanitarian crisis for the people involved,” said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. “For those stuck at home without enough food or medical support, this is a government-created crisis. There’s a way to deal with public health concerns that does not require people to go hungry.” Read more here: Thousands of Cambodians go hungry in strict lockdown zones “I think we should view it as a country-wide problem. It will get everywhere. We keep learning this lesson, but we know that this will be the case.” Naismith said he did not believe local restrictions would work to contain the variant. PA report he added: “When we tried locally having different restrictions in different regions that didn’t really make any difference. So I don’t think thinking about a localised strategy for containment will really work.” Foreign Office minister James Cleverly reiterated on Sky News with regard to any possible delay to easing restrictions in England, that “Scientists on Sage will make their assessments, they will report that to government, and we will make decisions based on the data and the evidence that they provide. “The prime minister, the health secretary, have always been clear that the easing of restrictions which allow us to get back to normality will be done at a pace and in a way which is safe. We will always be driven by the data.” There has been considerable criticism of the UK government for delaying putting India on to the travel “red list”, as the rise in Covid cases in India coincided with prime minister Boris Johnson’s plans for a high profile overseas trip there to promote post-Brexit trade which he was anxious not to cancel. Cleverly, the MP for Braintree, has also insisted on BBC Breakfast that the UK government has learnt lessons throughout the pandemic. Asked about the planned inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, Cleverly claimed “No one is pretending that every decision was perfect, that’s not possible when you are making decisions with an incomplete information picture as we had to, as all governments had to. “We have been learning lessons, both as a government and scientific community, as the battle against this pandemic has been conducted.”Advocates have also warned that people with a disability, including group home residents and those in regional areas, are still missing out on their Covid-19 vaccinations. The health department announced on Thursday that almost 2.9m Australians have been vaccinated, including about 279,986 in aged and disability care. But the department’s daily data releases do not give specific figures on the vaccination of either the aged care workforce or those in disability care, two areas where the rollout is lagging badly. Leading Age Services Australia, a peak group for aged care, has warned the government the rollout has been too slow for critical aged care staff. Chief executive Sean Rooney said his organisation has been “disappointed with the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the responses to the issues raised by the Department of Health”. “We welcome the extended rollout since the beginning of May, especially for residents,” he said in a statement to the . “But it is vital that the aged care workforce is given priority and vaccinated quickly, particularly as we head into winter.

The regional branch of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said it had recorded 16 cases of the variant among Indian students at Ulyanovsk State University, which is some 700 kilometres (435 miles) east of Moscow. Reuters report that Dilyar Khakimov, an official at the watchdog, told Kommersant that the students had been put in self-isolation and were under medical observation. Deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova had previously said the country had not recorded any cases of the variant. The World Health Organization said on Monday that the coronavirus variant first identified in India last year was being classified as a variant of global concern, with some preliminary studies showing that it spreads more easily."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Europe Letter: More than 50 green laws and reforms on EU schedule in next 18 monthsReview of State\u0026rsquos environmental record warns of post-pandemic rise in emissions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Dara MacDónaillA 13-year-old girl with severe anorexia, who has been refusing to eat for days at a time since last year, has been in a general hospital for more than nine weeks as there is no specialised eating disorder bed available on the island of Ireland.Her mother, Elizabeth McCrave who lives in Dundalk, Co Louth, is pleading with the Health Service Executive to fund a bed in a specialised unit in England if necessary. She fears if her daughter Dearbhla returns home she will die: “I am trying my best to save the life of my child . . . do I have to lose her for them to realise?”The case was raised in the Dáil last week by local Ruairí Ó Murchú (Sinn Féin) with Minister of State for Mental Health Mary Butler. Advocacy groups say it is a “harrowing example of an eating disorder crisis . . . spiralling out of control”. HSE figures show the number of referrals for eating disorders has increased 66 per cent since March 2020. Ms McCrave brought her then 12-year-old daughter to their GP in July 2020 after four months of continually reduced food intake. He referred her to the local child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) with a suspected eating disorder. “She was going days not letting food pass her mouth,” says Ms McCrave. “She was absolutely shattered, a pain in her head all the time. I couldn’t leave her because I’d never know when she was going to collapse. The only thing I was told was if she did to call an ambulance.”In July, CAHMS referred her to a specialist eating disorder bed in an adolescent mental health unit, Linn Dara, in Dublin, and she was admitted on January 7th. “They let her home after two weeks for the weekend to see how she’d get on. Not one bite of food passed her mouth, so they came and took her back on the Monday. She wouldn’t eat and they tube fed her.” She was discharged on February 15th.She has been in a paediatric ward in the hospital since.“Sometimes she tells you she’s struggling and sometimes she says she’s fine. She tells me she feels she has razor-blades in her head, thinking, thinking, thinking, and she wants to go to sleep. I tell her, ‘You have to keep fighting it pet’.”Ms McCrave said her daughter was eating “a little” in the hospital and had regained strength. “But the minute she gets home the anorexia grabs her by the throat and she will not eat a thing.”Single motherCAMHS has sought a specialised eating disorder bed for her in Cork, Galway, Dublin and Belfast without success. “They said last week they could refer her across the water to a clinic outside London. I wouldn’t see her for six weeks but at least I’d know she is getting the care she needs.”Ms McCrave, a single mother, has three other children aged seven to 18. “They are heartbroken over this. They miss her terribly. How extreme does this have to get for her to get the treatment she needs? All them weeks of her lying in a hospital bed she could be in a specialised bed, getting her treatment and the proper care she needs.”Joyce Russell, founder of Parents Action and Care Group, a support organisation for parents of young people with eating disorders, says: “The eating disorders crisis has been growing for several years and with Covid is spiralling out of control . . . There just are not enough intensive services, understanding or awareness . . . It is a deeply complex mental illness with a high mortality rate.”Mr Ó Murchú says an “audit of the entire eating disorder system is needed” to ensure intensive, early interventions are available throughout the country. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said Ms Butler had requested an “urgent report” from the HSE on the case. “There are no specialist eating disorder beds in the MidlandsLouthMeath mental health services. A priority for Minister Butler, and the HSE, is to expand the number of specialist eating disorder teams nationally in 2021 and beyond,” she said.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"we re waiting for you a message to madeleine mccann on her 18th birthday","story":"The parents of missing British girl Madeleine McCann marked the 18th birthday of their daughter, just more than 14 years since she disappeared on holiday in Portugal.

Photograph:  Arun SankarAFP via Getty ImagesA swift and collaborative international response could have stopped the 2019 Covid-19 outbreak in China becoming a global catastrophe in 2020, according to a scathing report on the response of world leaders and the World Health Organisation to the pandemic.An expert review by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, commissioned by the WHO, sets out lessons for preventing future pandemics and makes dozens of recommendations for reform.They include a new treaty setting up a Global Health Threats Council, more surveillance power for the WHO to investigate and publish information about disease outbreaks without the approval of governments, and new funding for an International Pandemic Financing Facility (IPFF) that could spend $5 billion-$10 billion (€4.1 billion-€8.2 billion) a year on preparedness and call on $50 billion-$100 billion at short notice in a health emergency.“The panel is recommending a fundamental transformation designed to ensure commitment at the highest level to a new system ... on which citizens can rely to keep them safe and healthy,” said its co-chairs, former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former president of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.The review does not examine the origins of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. But it criticises the Chinese authorities and WHO for being too slow to recognise that the virus was spreading between people in Wuhan and then to warn the world about human to human transmission.“For the future, a precautionary approach should be used from the outset, acknowledging that a respiratory disease may spread from person to person unless and until established otherwise,” the report says.“If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly and more widely, that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the virus,” Clark told a press briefing ahead of the review’s publication. “We have to realise that we are living in the 21st century and not in medieval times.”The panel criticises the WHO for not declaring Covid a public health emergency of international concern until January 30th. It was officially called a pandemic on March 11th.But the strongest criticism was directed at the wealthy nations of Europe and North America for “wasting February 2020” through inaction – leading to “a lost month when many more countries could have taken steps to contain the spread of Sars-Cov-2 and forestall the global health, social and economic catastrophe that continues its grip”.When the gravity of the crisis was finally acknowledged in March 2020, “there was a mad scramble for PPE, therapeutics and other equipment”, said Clark. “This was compounded by a lack of global leadership.”To provide leadership in future, the panel calls on the world’s heads of government to set up a Global Health Threats Council and a Pandemic Framework Convention to provide a stronger legal foundation for action. It recommends these are launched at a global summit, a special session of the United Nations General Assembly that should be convened for the purpose later this year.WHO financingThe council would allocate funds from the IPFF to institutions developing preparedness and response capabilities, including a global platform capable of delivering vaccines, diagnostics, drugs and supplies “swiftly and equitably worldwide – shifting from a market model to one aimed at delivering global public goods”. The facility should be ready to disburse up to $100 billion at short notice in the event of another pandemic, the panel says.The review also calls for the authority and financing of the WHO to be strengthened. This would involve increasing the fees paid by member states “depoliticising recruitment (especially at senior levels) by adhering to criteria of merit and relevant competencies” improving the performance of its board – which the panel says failed to perform as an executive body during the pandemic – and appointing a director-general with a single seven-year term of office rather than the current renewable five-year terms.Panel members are talking to heads of government to ensure the measures are implemented. “The shelves of storage rooms in the UN and national capitals are full of reports and reviews of previous health crises,” Sirleaf said. “Had their warnings been heeded, we would have avoided the catastrophe we are in today.

Not quite.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inquiry must do apportion blame","story":"Indeed, since the virus is likely to return in the winter, even next spring may be a problematic point at which to start the inquiry. There is concern about a possible flu epidemic since the historically low rates of the disease over the past 12 months make vaccines harder to adapt.A perfectly legitimate case can be made for not having this type of inquiry at all but since Mr Johnson would have been hounded until he agreed, it was pointless to resist. However, it will last for years, whereas the lessons from the pandemic need to be learned now. Many of them are already apparent. The World Health Organisation’s panel of independent experts and senior political figures, which has reported within just a few months, set out just a few of them yesterday.We know all of this without the need for a public inquiry. As to the actions of the British Government, several parliamentary committees have taken extensive evidence from senior Government advisers and Sage scientists while auditors have looked into the speed, cost and propriety of the procurement process. Again, what has been learned must be taken on board now and not await the outcome of a public inquiry. We may have to deal with another epidemic before it reports.The inquiry chairman has yet to be appointed and the terms of reference are still to be announced. The former is likely to be a judge and the latter must range more widely than public health matters. A sterile argument over whether the country should have locked down a week or two before it did will help no one, but is likely to be the conclusion sought by Mr Johnson’s opponents.Given what has happened, it is evident that the strategy for dealing with a pandemic was flawed and the shortcomings need to be put right now. But what was not planned for at all was the impact of the lockdowns. No government had ever contemplated such action and everything – from the unprecedented restrictions on personal freedoms to the massive cost of underpinning the economy – had to be made up on the spot.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day monstrous deep sea fish found california beach","story":"This bizarre fish, thought to be a Pacific Football Fish, was found on the sand on the shore of Crystal Cove State Park\u0027s Marine Protected Area in Laguna Beach, California, USA. The Pacific Football Fish is one of over 200 species of anglerfish globally, according to California State Parks, and can normally be found in the lower reaches of the ocean where no light reachesIsraeli military draws up plan for ground invasion of GazaPolitics latest news: David Cameron set for Greensill grilling as MPs reveal their planned questionsWatch: Journalist rushes for cover as Gaza building destroyed during live reportAI and robots will be used to assess patients in NHS plan to tackle record waiting listsScotland’s education system weakest in UK, according to new reportDavid Cameron Greensill scandal: What is the lobbying row about?Covid lockdown roadmap: the rules that are changing from May 17Astrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, side effects and risks for under-40s Israel-Palestine Conflict: what is behind the violence in Gaza and Jerusalem?Thursday morning UK news briefing: Israel facing conflict on two frontsEllen DeGeneres calls time on TV show \u0026#39to take a break from talking\u0026#39Sex and violence offences set to increase by a fifth, study warnsBlenheim Palace renames \u0026#39Indian Room\u0026#39 to avoid provoking controversy with Churchill exhibition Major retailers promise not to ditch cash as shoppers are turned away\u0026#39Tricky topic\u0026#39: Lady Kitty Spencer on the thorny issue of inheritance and AlthorpCan Joe Biden afford to stay out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?Comment: A new axis of evil is fomenting violence in IsraelBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"special report gp services lapsed long term sickness","story":"In 1948, the year the NHS was founded, my mother, then six, fell ill with rheumatic fever. She can still remember the name of the general practitioner who visited her every day for the six months she was confined to bed: Dr Saunders.Last week, by contrast, she banged her shin on the car door. Bleeding heavily, she couldn’t get an appointment at that very same surgery and went to the minor injuries unit at the local hospital. There she was told no one could see her. After much complaining the wound was eventually treated, but getting a GP appointment to have the dressing changed proved a full-time job.Dr Brown turned 100 recently. He was born 10 years after the National Insurance Act, the foundation on which our system of general practice has since been built. And he has lived long enough to see the day that GPs have been told to discourage patients from booking face-to-face appointments. So how on earth did we get from there to here?Much of the fault, if fault there is, must fall on us, the public. For a start there are simply more of us. In the year the NHS was founded the UK population was 49  million. By 1973 it was 56  million, and today it stands at 66  million. In those 70 years our numbers have grown by 34.7 per cent.But it turns out that this, on its own, is not the problem. For the number of GPs per capita has also risen. Indeed, in the last half century, work by the Nuffield Trust shows the number of GPs in the UK per 100,000 people has risen from 42 to 60. Though this doesn’t quite tell the whole story, because GP numbers were even higher a decade ago, at 67 per 100,000, so relatively over the last 10 years or so, there has been a noticeable decline.The big problem is not that there are more of us but that there are more of us living longer with chronic, complex conditions. Seventy years ago, men could expect to live to 66 and women to 71. Today those figures stand at 79 and 83. Those dozen or so years of extra life often come at significant cost to the NHS.While GP numbers have risen faster than general population growth, they have not kept pace with the increase of over-65s who most demand treatment.Dealing with complex diseases has also driven the need for coordination with hospital care and other services and, as a result, greater bureaucracy.To compound the problems raised by such huge demographic and public health shifts, GP trends are also changing. According to the General Medical Council, there has been a major recent move away from full-time staff to locums.Much as we might all hanker after the old days, trying to restore general practice to the way it was when my mother was a girl and Dr Brown was in training is not possible. Not even a vast influx of new GPs could deliver sustained pastoral care to a public which, through age and ill health, has become immensely needier.As the pandemic ebbs and we return to using hospitals in a more usual fashion, and GP surgeries which have been turned over to the vaccination programme open for business again, some immediate pinch points are likely to ease. But long term, solving the GP problem will only come with other major fixes such as solving the obesity problem, which is really a poverty issue, and the social care problem. The scale of that challenge? Doing either is likely to require a shake-up as radical as any we have seen in the last year.Have you struggled to book a GP appointment? We want to hear from you.

We don’t want to go down that route, but is that the only option for us?” says Stephen, a Loyalist community worker close to North Belfast Ulster Defence Association (UDA).“London needs to know there\u0027s a new generation that is so angry and bitter you can cut it with a knife. This is the biggest threat to peace there’s ever been.”The  was given exclusive access last week to people close to the UDA and two other Loyalist paramilitary groups, the  Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Red Hand Commando.The groups have issued a chilling warning:  Northern Ireland is a matchstick away from being ignited, accusing Boris Johnson of selling us down the tubes.The anxieties and the problems are clear starting with the customs border created by brexit in the Irish Sea that has driven a wedge between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain and a real sense that hardline republicans in Sinn Fein and its one-time military wing the IRA have won.The failure to prosecute Sinn Fein leaders who broke Covid-19 rules last year to attend  the funeral of Bobby Storey, the terrorist group’s ‘brutal’, one-time head of intelligence, continues to cause a bitter outrage.Meanwhile the Unionists are in turmoil with Arlene Foster forced to quit as leader of the Democractic Unionist party (DUP) and First Minister. A new leader is due to be elected on Friday. Added to the heady mix is the pursuit in Belfast courts of Army veterans accused of murder during the troubles while IRA terrorists received ‘comfort’ letters, and it feels like all the hard work of the Good Friday Agreement is unravelling.Security sources fear the peace deal is facing its greatest threat since its signing 23 years ago in 1998.“This community has gained nothing from the peace process. Nothing, says Dean, a Loyalist community worker close to North Belfast UDA.He said the area of Tiger’s Bay had gone to “wrack and ruin” since the Good Friday Agreement.“Boris Johnson has sold us down the tubes and he’ll regret it. He’s seriously misunderstood this.” Despite promises that there would be no customs border in the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson agreed to the Northern Ireland protocol as a way of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, amid fears a land customs border between the UK and Ireland would be attacked by Republican paramilitaries.Speaking in the New Beginnings office in Tiger’s Bay, Michael Bingham, 60, said the Good Friday Agreement is now being used as a “beating stick against the Protestant people”.“I thought 1998 would be the year this all stopped and our kids could have a normal life. “Sitting here in 2021, there’s been some changes but all the trouble hasn’t gone away, it’s still hanging over your shoulder.“I want to let our children know there is an alternative to all this. But we can’t do it without political backup.Michael spoke to the  at one of the Peace Lines: walls and barriers used to separate protestant and catholic communities. The total length of peace line barriers has increased since the Good Friday Agreement was signed. “People are still being attacked in their homes, people are still being shot, bombs are still being planted under cars, prison officers are being murdered, Michael said. Is it a peace process or not? It only seems to be so on one side at the moment.”Whitehall sources told the  a range of issues have left Loyalists feeling insecure about their identity and future, adding: unrest and unease has been building for some time.Both main Unionist parties  are currently electing new leaders, with the DUP expected to elect Arlene Foster\u0027s successor on Friday.The party\u0027s rulebook says the new leader and deputy - Nigel Dodds stood down on May 5 - will be elected by assembly members, MPs and peers.Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland’s agricultural minister, is the hardline favourite, having been a vocal opponent of post-Brexit trading arrangements in the province. His rival, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP’s incumbent Westminster leader,  is seen as the moderate candidate.Loyalists will want to see a fresh approach to the Good Friday Agreement and the protocol from the new leader .Winston ‘Winkie’ Irvine, a spokesman for the Progressive Unionist Party, said support for the Good Friday Agreement among Loyalist communities was “haemorrhaging”.Speaking to the  in the offices of Action for Community Transformation on the Shankill Road in West Belfast, he said: “People are saying ‘this isn’t what I signed up for, what I went to jail for. This isn\u0027t why my family are lying in graveyards across Northern Ireland.“The dangers are absolutely massive. We’re a matchstick away from this place being ignited.”Referring to the riots that broke out across Northern Ireland two weeks ago, Mr Irvine, who is close to West Belfast UVF, said: “We came within minutes of a potential bloodbath. “That scene was reminiscent of the outbreak of the Troubles here on the Shankill 50 years ago. The only thing that was missing was people having their houses petrol bombed. “Had that happened we would have been into full scale military engagement using physical force not just petrol bombs and masonry, we would have been in a deep dangerous spiral of tit-for-tat.”The funeral in 2020 of leading IRA figure Bobby Storey, attended by around 2,000 supporters when Covid rules limited attendee numbers to 15, is a source of particular anger among Loyalists. They are disgusted no action was taken against Sinn Fein organisers, or Michelle O’Neill, Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, for attending.“She knew the rules inside out…and they got away with it,” Stephen said.There were uncorroborated reports of Sinn Fein security guards turning other mourners away from the cemetery during the funeral. Stephen says the whole thing was a message from Sinn Fein: ‘we run the show’.“That’s what that was: ‘we call shots’. I know people who were given £100 fines for having kids\u0027 birthday parties. Not one fine was given out there.”Mr Irvine added: “Could you imagine a cabinet minister in London going to a similar type of funeral and surviving politically?“We’re at a really dangerous moment here in terms of the political and peace process. I would urge people to think about these things. Mr Irvine said the Good Friday Agreement consolidated the peace deal that predated it but warned: “The bedrock of the political progress here has been shaken to the core”.He expects after lockdown, and with better weather, more people will take to the streets. Against the backdrop of the parading season and tense political situation over the “juggernaut of Brexit”, it could lead to a long, hot summer.“If anybody thinks tinkering around the edges of the protocol to ensure freer access here or there for specific goods is going to be sufficient to deal with the issues, they\u0027re deluding themselves.”“We’re trying to warn people of impending things,” James ‘Jimbo’ Wilson, 69, a former Loyalist internee close to the Red Hand Commando group, said.“Boris Johnson, the Irish government, the American government, and the European government need to sit down and get something sorted.“We might have been paramilitaries in our day, but I’m an old man and most of the leadership in Loyalism would be elderly. We will be pushed to the side and these young lads will go ahead and do what they think is right. Mr Irvine agreed: “There is a prevailing sense in the communities that politics isn\u0027t able to deliver on the solutions required to fix the problems at the moment. Therefore people are resorting to other means.”He describes as “dangerous” former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney’s reference, during Brexit negotiations, to possible Republican Dissident violence in the event of a hard border. “I don\u0027t think they priced in the reaction because it sent the signal that the threat of violence will be leveraged the threat of violence is the currency that has the greatest value in order to gain advantage in negotiations.“That\u0027s exactly what you\u0027re seeing playing out now. “You\u0027re seeing people saying, ‘it worked for them, it may just work for us’. That’s a very dangerous political trajectory to set any community on.”Loyalist community leaders also worry policing is being politicised in the province. When the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), an umbrella group for Loyalist paramilitaries formed in 2015, sought a meeting with the PSNI Chief Constable, the Northern Ireland Justice Minister and leader of the centrist Alliance Party, Naomi Long, was “apoplectic” and “openly politically hostile to the police engaging with Loyalism,” Mr Irvine says. In recent years the Alliance Party has taken votes from centrist parties such as the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Ulster Unionist Party. Mr Irvine says that in order to appeal to centre-left voters targeted by Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party has recently adopted a harder stance towards Loyalism.He contrasts this approach with that taken over the Bobby Storey funeral and says there is no “political cover” for police to engage with Loyalism. “It places the police in an extraordinarily difficult space,” he says.“It’s not straightforward to say Loyalism has lost confidence in the police and the Chief Constable. No matter who the Chief Constable is, the same problems will occur because you have a Justice Minister who has priced in that being hostile to Loyalist communities is a vote winner.“They’re now trying to play the other side of the coin so that they can become the largest party between the green and the orange,” Mr Wilson adds. “You can understand why genuine Loyalists get so frustrated.”A security source in Belfast told the  many Loyalists now viewed the police as a nationalist force and therefore a legitimate target for reprisals.Mr Irvine said Loyalists were the strongest advocates for peace as they have experienced first-hand the consequences “when politics doesn\u0027t deliver”.“The only way we\u0027ll fix this is if we have London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels on the same page, getting us back in the orbit of the Good Friday Agreement.“We have a short period of time to do that.“We don\u0027t want to see a single person going to prison. We don’t want to see another person get a criminal record. But we also don\u0027t want to see the Union being broken up. Loyalism can\u0027t stand by.“Loyalism needs help, it needs support, and it needs politicians to get real about the problems.”Doug Beattie, Ulster Unionist MLA member for Upper Bann and the man tipped to be the next leader of the party, says people see in the Brexit protocol “that their concerns have been absolutely ignored by the UK government”.It created “sheer anger and frustration,” he said.“Boris Johnson has lied to them he wasn\u0027t up front, he hasn’t told them the truth.”He also criticised Leo Varadkar for showing pictures of a bombed out British army checkpoint on the border. “Every time the EU spoke about violence, they spoke about violence, on the border. “Everybody was only concerned about the frontier between the UK and the EU. They weren\u0027t concerned with violence in Belfast or anywhere else away from the border. That doesn\u0027t affect them. “Those threats of violence, led Boris to the negotiating stance that we\u0027re in.“That\u0027s an awful place to be that governments are either making decisions based on the threat of violence, or they\u0027re making decisions because of violence. “The only way to fix this is if the EU and UK, just stop and look at the mess and realise that, as they beat each other over Brexit, the only people suffering are the people in Northern Ireland.“Whether he stays as Prime Minister is not down to Northern Ireland, it\u0027s going to be down to a vote in England. So his brand of English nationalism is creating a problem. “He is a Prime Minister that could lead to the destruction of our union.“Violence and the threat of violence has returned to Northern Ireland politics.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trans women told doctors not wearing enough lipstick","story":"Trans women are being told they are not wearing enough lipstick or “feminine clothing” by doctors, MPs have heard. The Women and Equalities Select Committee heard evidence on Wednesday from a variety of medical professionals and campaigners regarding gender healthcare as part of its inquiry into the reform of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA).Dr Harriet Hutchinson, community organiser at Action for Trans Health Durham, described the current processes of “attempting to prove your gender to a clinician” as a “disturbing”, “intrusive and degrading process. In accordance with current regulations, in many cases trans people are required to live in their ‘preferred’ gender for two years in order to gain ‘real life experience’ of living and working in their preferred gender.Dr Hutchinson told the virtual hearing: “Our services users have been in appointments where they\u0027ve been criticised for not wearing lipstick or received lectures from cisgender clinicians that the trousers they were wearing weren\u0027t \u0027feminine enough\u0027 to be regarded as female presentation.She added: So the idea of having to prove your gender is very reductive and forces trans people to conform to stereotypes in order to receive a diagnosis and then, of course, receive criticism for perpetuating gender stereotypes.Dr John Chisholm CBE, chair of the Medical Ethics Committee at the British Medical Association (BMA) also told MPs: It\u0027s very onerous and dehumanising to have to be asked all these intrusive questions in order to prove, in essence, that you are who you say you are…We\u0027ve come a long way from regarding gender dysphoria as a medical problem, or a psychological problem or a mental health problem, and yet we are forced back into this paradigm by way of how the law operates.As of 2020, more than 13,500 trans and non-binary were on a waiting list for an NHS gender clinic, according to research conducted by the BBC.The NHS constitution mandates that after receiving a GP referral, the waiting time for a first appointment at a gender clinic should be no longer than 18 weeks, but in many parts of the country this wait is now up to five years.Earlier this month, the cost of applying for a GRC was cut from £140 to £5 as part of changes the government claims will make applying for one “simpler and much more affordable”.The move came after ministers decided last September against wider changes to gender recognition rules that would have allowed people to change their gender legally without a medical diagnosis - a decision which prompted LGBTQ+ campaigners and charities, such as Stonewall, to deem it “a shocking failure in leadership”.  The Women and Equalities Select Committee hearing continues.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"blenheim palace renames indian room avoid provoking controversy","story":"Blenheim Palace has changed the name of its “Indian Room” to avoid causing controversy with colonial links in a new Winston Churchill exhibition.An exhibition titled Greatest Briton at the wartime leader’s Oxfordshire birthplace will detail his life story with displays throughout the 18th-century stately home, including in the property’s Indian Room named for its Raj-themed wallpaper.Churchill’s legacy has been scrutinised after Black Lives Matter protests saw his Parliament Square statue daubed with the word “racist” last year, and the National Trust promised to address his alleged role in the Bengal Famine which left up to three million Indians dead.Blenheim Palace bosses have now changed the name of the home’s Indian Room to the “Summer Terrace Room” to remove any colonial connotations in the exhibition on the former Prime Minister.“We didn’t want to provoke controversy,” operations director Heather Carter told The Daily .“We have changed the name of the room.  It’s not the Indian Room, it’s now the Summer Terrace Room.  It’s about making it more accessible.”The Indian Room’s wallpaper has depicted a tiger hunt since first being commissioned by George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough, in 1826, but the suite overlooking the gardens was likely called the Summer Terrace Room during Churchill’s lifetime.It will be used as part of a child-friendly exhibition on the two-time Prime Minister, with accessibility for a broad audience in mind, rather than the historical reckoning promised at other historic sites.The National Trust last year unveiled a dossier of research into alleged colonial connections at Churchill\u0027s Chartwell home in Kent, noting that “he was prime minister during the devastating Bengal famine of 1943”.Academics convened at the eponymous Churchill College Cambridge, named in his honour, alleged he was complicit in the famine, as well claiming he was a “white supremacist” and “worse than the Nazis”.But, despite changing the name of the Indian Room, Churchill\u0027s ancestral home will break ranks with the revisionism of other institutions by framing the politician as a wartime hero.Ms Carter said:  “We don’t touch on the controversy.  We feel that that is not our story to tell.“We are aware of the debate about his life and legacy, but that is for others to tell.“We don\u0027t go deeply into all the politics and the controversy.“He won a great war, he was a hero.  That is how we see him.  This is a celebration.”The exhibition will offer a personal history of the leader and his links to Blenheim, making use of props including waxwork sculpture of the Prime Minister, and a tent similar to the one he would have used during the Boer War.The visual rather than text-led exhibition has been devised to attract visitors to the stately home beyond avid historians and fans of Churchill, Ms Carter said.In 1874, the wartime leader was born on the estate which was a gift to his ancestor General John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, for his victory at Blenheim during the War of the Spanish Succession.The stately home remained a destination for Churchill during school holidays and later for house parties, and the family history connected to the house was an inspiration for both his historical writing and his wartime strategy.Blenheim Palace’s Emily Hirons said:  “The Palace and the estate was one of his most cherished places and he returned here again and again throughout his long life.”New displays will be open to visitors from May 17. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can joe biden afford stay israeli palestinian conflict","story":"President Joe Biden entered the White House with a “stand back” approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Many of his predecessors made big promises on solving the longest and most intractable conflict, but invariably came up short.Much of the president’s first few months has been spent tackling the US’s more pressing domestic problems. Inheriting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic, a tanking economy and catastrophic unemployment, has left him time for little else. Meanwhile, Mr Biden, much like Donald Trump before him, has tried desperately to extricate America from Middle East wars - withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan and taking a backseat in Syria.The inertia was not so much of an issue when the region was quiet.But with the violence in Israel and the occupied Gaza Strip threatening to escalate into a major all-out conflict, can Mr Biden afford to keep looking away?  His colleagues in the Democratic Party don’t think so.In public, they have implored their president in tweets to do something. “President Biden needs to step in and deescalate to stop the carnage,” tweeted Representative Ilhan Omar on Wednesday. “Palestinian children deserve advocates for their humanity, safety and security.”In private, they have urged him to exert more pressure on Israel’s government over settlement activity they believe are making the prospects for an agreement with the Palestinians virtually impossible.Martin Indyk, a former US ambassador to Israel and a former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, does not blame the president’s approach of “conflict management, rather than conflict resolution”, but believes it was time for him to step into the fray before things spiral out of the US”s control.“They need to establish a dialogue with the Palestinians,” Mr Indyk told the New York Times, noting Mr Biden was yet to talk directly to Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. The president has not even yet nominated an ambassador to Israel.On Wednesday, Mr Biden finally broke his silence to say Israel had the right to defend itself against “thousands of rockets” flying into its territory.And while he called for calm from both sides, he notably said nothing of Israel’s targeting of residential buildings in the occupied Gaza Strip, or of the more than 200 Palestinians killed.The US has a long and historic ties with Israel, that until recently have been largely bipartisan. However, the Democratic Party has moved to the Left in recent years - partly as a result of Donald Trump’s closeness to Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu.Mr Biden criticised Mr Trump, who helped establish relations between Tel Aviv and a number of Gulf Arab states through the Abraham Accords. And since taking office he has reversed some of his more radical policy decisions, including restoring US funding for Palestinians and resuming diplomatic contacts with Palestinian officials.But in truth, Mr Biden has few of his own ideas and is currently treading a well-worn path- one we know from experience leads nowhere.But the situation urgently needs mediation from a powerful ally. Neither side currently appears prepared to back down and they will need persuading.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel military draws plan ground invasion gaza","story":"The Israeli military was drawing up plans to send troops into Gaza on Thursday as it continued to exchange fire with Hamas fighters through the night, while in Israeli cities a fresh wave of riots led to 400 arrests.The Israeli Defense Forces said it had deployed two infantry units and one armoured unit to the border with Gaza, and that a ground operations plan would be submitted to military chiefs later today, ahead of approval by the Israeli government. The decision on whether to invade Gaza is up to the Israeli government, rather than the military, and it carries significant political implications for the cabinet as it would substantially increase the risk of far more Israeli casualties.Despite diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis, which US President Joe Biden said he hoped would end sooner than later, hundreds of rockets flew across the Gaza Strip overnight.James Cleverly, the UK Middle East minister, described the level of rocket fire from Gaza into Israel as unprecedented, and called on all sides to step back from the brink.Air raid warnings went off across Israel, including for the first time in the country\u0027s north, though on Thursday an Israeli military spokesman said this had been a false alarm. Israel\u0027s air force said it had launched multiple strikes, targeting what it described as locations linked to the counterintelligence infrastructure of Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, as well as the house of Iyad Tayeb, one of the movement\u0027s commanders.There were reports from Gaza on Thursday that Israel had struck a Hamas-controlled ministry of finance building as well as a Hamas-controlled bank. IDF strikes also destroyed a multi-storey tower housing Palestinian television channel Al-Aqsa, which was set up by Hamas.It\u0027s the same atmosphere of 2014, Saud Abu Ramadan, a freelance journalist in Gaza City, said.He was referring to the bloody 7-week war that followed the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas members. Over 2,000 Palestinians and widespread destruction was inflicted on Gaza\u0027s infrastructure. Warplanes are buzzing, and people are just trying to keep their heads down,” he added.Israel said Palestinian militants had launched around 1,600 rockets into its territory since Monday evening.Many in Israel also holed up in shelters as waves of rockets hit its heartland, some blown out of the sky by Iron Dome interceptors.All of Israel is under attack. It\u0027s a very scary situation to be in, said Margo Aronovic, a 26-year-old student, in Tel Aviv.We\u0027re coping, sitting at home, hoping it will be OK, said Motti Haim, a resident of the central town of Beer Yaakov and father of two children. It\u0027s not simple running to the shelter. It\u0027s not easy with the kids.In Gaza, 67 people have been killed so far, including 17 children, and nearly 400 injured after days of near relentless Israeli air strikes. In Israel, the casualty rate has risen to seven following the death of an Israeli soldier and a five-year-old boy who was killed by rocket fire. On Wednesday, Hamas announced the death of its military chief in Gaza City, Bassem Issa, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) saying they had killed several other senior Hamas figures as well.Health authorities in Gaza said they were investigating the deaths of several people overnight who they said may have inhaled poisonous gas. Samples were being examined and they had yet to draw any final conclusions, they said.There were 400 arrests across Israeli cities such as Acre, Haifa and Lod overnight in what the president of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, described as a civil war between Arab and Jewish residents. Israeli TV footage showed Jewish rioters pulling an Arab man from his car and beating him severely, in what was described as a lynching. In the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Lod, Arab rioters torched cars, a school and a synagogue.Mr Rivlin, in unusually strong language, denounced what he described as a pogrom in which an incited and bloodthirsty Arab mob had injured people and attacked sacred Jewish spaces.In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian man was killed during a confrontation with Israeli soldiers near the northern city of Nablus, the Palestinian health ministry said Thursday.What has been happening these last few days in Israeli towns is unacceptable... Nothing justifies the lynching of Arabs by Jews and nothing justifies the lynching of Jews by Arabs, Mr Netanyahu said, adding that Israel was fighting a battle on two fronts.While United Nations and Egyptian officials have said that cease-fire efforts are underway, there were no signs of progress on Thursday.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the indiscriminate launching of rockets from civilian areas in Gaza toward Israeli population centers, but he also urged Israel to show maximum restraint.Amid fears the violence could spiral further out of control, Washington planned to send an envoy, Hady Amr, for talks with Israel and Palestinians.My expectation and hope is this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself, Mr Biden said on Wednesday.Mr Cleverly, Britain\u0027s minister for the Middle East, called on Hamas, Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink of what he cast as a terrible escalation, and told the Islamist group to cease rocket attacks on the Jewish state.It is important for both sides to take a step back, Mr Cleverly told Sky News.We have seen, however, an unprecedented level of rocket attack into Israel, he said. We want to see the rocket attacks stop.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thursday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Israel faces an escalating conflict on two fronts, as it scrambles to quell riots on its streets after days of exchanging deadly fire with Palestinian militants in Gaza.US president Joe Biden said Israelis had the right to defend themselves against Hamas attacks after a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but said he hoped both sides were able to de-escalate. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tricky topic lady kitty spencer thorny issue inheritance althorp","story":"Lady Kitty Spencer has said that attitudes to primogeniture are changing, despite her father’s insistence that she will not inherit Althorp.Earl Spencer, brother to Diana, Princess of Wales, plans to leave the estate to his son, Louis, who will inherit the title despite having three older sisters.The eldest is Lady Kitty, 30, who suggested that her father’s decision was out of step with modern thinking.“Primogeniture can be a tricky topic, because as times are changing, attitudes are as well. We’ve grown up understanding that it’s Louis to inherit, and Louis will do an incredible job,” she told Town \u0026amp Country magazine.Lady Kitty’s comments are the latest contribution to the debate over female heirs. In 2011, the 300-year-old rules of succession to the throne were changed to give equal rights to sons and daughters of any future British monarch. Had the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge been a girl, she would have grown up to become Queen.David Cameron, then Prime Minister, said at the time that “the idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man, just isn’t acceptable any more”.Nevertheless, in 2015 Earl Spencer confirmed that he would be sticking with tradition.“If I chose Kitty it would be against all the tradition that goes with Althorp. It’s just the way it is. I get the problems with it as a concept,” he said.“I also get the strengths of it having worked to date. It is still intact. If you go around the chateaux of the Loire or whatever, they are empty. Everything gets split equally through the generations and you end up with a beautiful building with one nice tapestry in it. The whole idea of primogeniture was to keep it together.”Lady Kitty spoke fondly of Althorp, the 90-room house in Northamptonshire that has been the seat of the Spencer family for 19 generations.“We have such an emotional attachment to Althorp. That’s where we would have our Easter egg hunts and our Christmases I have my little vegetable patch, I learnt to ride a horse there, I learnt to ride a bike and to rollerblade. It’s so lovely to look back on the history and think everybody else probably learnt to ride a horse there too.”Critics of the primogeniture system include Lady Kinvara Balfour, who called the system “archaic” and “absolutely mad”, saying it sent a message that “a daughter is a disappointment” and women are second best.Her mother, Lady Tessa, was the eldest child of the 17th Duke of Norfolk but the title and Arundel Castle in West Sussex went to Lady Tessa’s younger brother.For the magazine photoshoot, Lady Kitty, a model and ambassador for Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, posed in the grounds of Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, rather than Althorp.She also recalled being thrust into the spotlight when she attended the wedding of her cousin, the Duke of Sussex. Overnight, her Instagram following leapt from 37,000 to half a million.“I woke up the next day and looked at my phone and thought, ‘Whoops, did I take someone else’s by mistake?’ It was very weird and a little overwhelming.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 public inquiry what","story":"NewsCovid- public inquiry: What the probe will look into and how it will workBoris Johnson confirmed an inquiry into the Governments handling of the Coronavirus pandemic to take place in Spring  - heres what its likely to address and what powers it could havemirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBoris Johnson confirmed the inquiry today \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Covid prevalence halved to its lowest level since last August in April, showing the vaccine rollout is stopping transmission even as lockdown rules were eased. There were marked reductions in prevalence from March to April and early May across the country, according to data from the latest round of the React- study. But it also found further evidence of the India strain - last week deemed a iant of concern - taking hold with cases detected in London in people with no recent travel history. Between March and April, swab-positivity dropped by % in England from .% to .%, the React- study found.  Experts estimate the corresponding R number to be .. The data includes , swab tests carried out across England between April  and May . Researchers found there was a fall in all age groups except the  to -year-olds, with a signicant fall in the  to -year-olds. Professor Paul Elliott, director of the React programme, told a press briefing: This coincides with the rollout of the vaccine programme to the younger part of that age group. The data also suggests higher prevalence among participants of the Asian community.  Researchers say the ergence between the pattern of infections and a pattern of hospital admissions and deaths suggests the rollout of mass vaccination is preventing severe outcomes. Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics, Imperial College London, said: What you can see in recent times - basically since the widespread rollout of the vaccine - and we showed this last time, that you see a decoupling of the relationship between the React infection and a lagged number of deaths. And this gap is showing how we can have more infections in the population with far fewer deaths. And we actually see that dference growing nicely now for hospitalisations as well, so for each infection in the community we are producing fewer hospitalisations and far fewer deaths.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: Todayaposs findings demonstrate the impact our incredible vaccination rollout is having on COVID- infection rates across the country, with prevalence lowest amongst those more vulnerable people aged  and over.The study also looked at the iants of coronavirus that were detected.Of the  positive swabs, the iant was identied in  cases - with  being identied as the Kent iant, and two of three cases in London being identied as the Indian iant of concern.

A study by experts in the US shows that delaying the second dose so that more people can receive a first dose could reduce deaths by up to a fth. It suggests other countries may wish to consider following the UK in delaying a second Covid jab by  weeks. Published in the British Medical Journal , one example showed thata first dose offered  per cent protection against Covid, deaths fell to  per , peoplethe second dose was delayed. This compared with  deathspeople got their second dose within the usual timeframe.  The researchers used a simulation model based on a real-world population of , US adults, finding that delaying a second dose could prove beneficiala single dose offers at least  per cent protection andvaccination rates stood at . per cent to . per cent of the population per day. The experts, including from the Hard School of Public Health in Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , calculated the strategy could prevent between  and  deaths per , people overall. It was particularly strong for the under- age group, where a delayed second dose strategy performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested.  The authors said: The results suggest that, under specic conditions, a decrease in cumulative mortality, infections, and hospital admissions can be achieved when the second dose of vaccine is delayed. This was most signicant when the second dose was delayed in people below  years of age, with second doses still prioritised for those over . The conditions in which these benefits were observed included the first-dose vaccine efficacy being above  per cent and vaccination rates remaining below  per cent of the population per day. They added: Delaying the second dose but prioritising it for people aged under  can result in lower mortality rates compared with the standard two-dose strategy, even at vaccination rates up to  per cent of the population per day.  Dr Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control, said the UKaposs decision to delay the second dose until  weeks had proven highly effective and the same could apply in other countries. He added: There have been concerns expressed about the lack of evidence for effectivenessthe prime-boost interval is extended by delaying the second dose.

It is known they murdered at least a dozen people between them but detectives have long since suspected they could have killed as many as  in total. Fred was charged with the murder of  people, but took his own le by suicide before he could stand trial, while Rose was convicted of the murder of  people. But investigators have always believed the pair were responsible for further unsolved murders and disappearances although they have never been properly investigated. During questioning Fred alluded to the fact there could be at least  other victims. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  For example four young women who matched the profile of Fred’s victims disappeared during his time living in Glasgow. One of these was Margaret McAvoy, who Fred knew when he worked in an ice cream van in the city. Fred also rented an allotment at the time which he once chillingly told a neighbour at the time was used for “something special”. Unfortunately police were never able to investigate the plot as it was paved over in the s for a section of the M motorway.  The depraved couple indulged in a known -year killing spree – often abducting young girls from the side of the road and then raping and torturing them. They murdered at least ten girls and buried them at their House of Horrors at  Cromwell Street. The crimes are known to have taken place roughly between  and . Their last known killing was their daughter Heather in  but police do not have any evidence of any more before their  arrest.  Following Rose West’s conviction in  the police released vague details of a list of women they have been told about who spent time at Cromwell Street but who they were struggling to trace. They eventually traced three of the women but the rest remain a mystery. It showed how Cromwell Street had become a well known boarding house for Gloucester’s was and strays and often a stopover for backpackers. But no one could have had any idea how close they were with a brush with evil at the time and had wandered into the West’s evil lair.  Former resident Jayne Hamer had been a lodger at  Cromwell Road when she was just  in . She said: “Fred felt he should take his daughters before any other man had her. “I heard one of the children down in the cellar, shouting ‘stop it daddy’.  “I hoped it wasn’t what I thought it was. I was devastated but I was  and had just left home and I knew no one would believe me, so I thought the best option was to move out.” At the time of the investigation lead detective, Superintendent John Bennett, called in criminal psychologist Paul Britton who chillingly concluded Fred was unlikely to ever stop killing completely.

Kate and Gerry McCann still hope she will be found alive,  years after she vanished on holiday in Portugal in , days before her fourth birthday. They said in a poignant message: “We love you and are waiting for you.” Devoted Kate and Gerry marked daughter Madeleine’s th birthday on Wednesday by leaving cards and gts in her room, untouched since she vanished  years ago. The couple posted a photo of her on the Find Madeleine campaign Facebook page, writing alongside it: “Happy th birthday Madeleine.  “We love you and we’re waiting for you and we’re never going to give up.” Kate, , and Gerry, , had asked pals to mark the day in a low-key manner. The Facebook post came a week after they marked the “particularly poignant” th anniversary of her disappearance. Madeleine went missing from her family’s holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz days before her fourth birthday in May .  Prosecutors want to question German paedophile Christian Brueckner over her disappearance and claim to have evidence that she is dead. But Kate and Gerry, , of Rothley, Leics, refuse to give up hope that Madeleine is still alive and will one day be found. In another post on the Find Madeleine page last week they said they “need to know what happened to our lovely daughter”. Scotland Yard’s hunt for Madeleine’s abductor continues, with four detectives still working on Operation Grange.  A top-level summit between German, British and Portuguese detectives is due to take place in Lisbon this summer. The Mirror revealed in January that cops are launching a push to find the “missing piece of the jigsaw” that could snare Brueckner. German and Portuguese investigators are to carry out new interviews of key witnesses in the Algarve who knew him. Brueckner, , was named as the prime suspect for Madeleine’s disappearance by German prosecutors last June.  They believe he abducted and killed the three-year-old. He is currently serving a seven-year term in a prison in Hanover for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in . His lawyer Friedrich Fulscher insists the German has nothing to do with the youngster’s disappearance. Last week the couple posted on Facebook: “Every May is tough – a reminder of years passed, of years together lost, or stolen.  “This year it is particularly poignant as we should be celebrating Madeleine’s th birthday. Enough said. “The Covid pandemic has made this year even more dficult for many reasons but thankfully the investigation to find Madeleine and her abductor has continued. “We hang on to the hope, however small, that we will see Madeleine again. “As we have said repeatedly, we need to know what has happened to our lovely daughter, no matter what.

Carla Paterson, along with partner Stephen Dunn, welcomed identical baby boys Blane and Blair on March  - eight months to the day after losing her mum, Jane Paterson, to cancer. The couple, from Hamilton, Scotland, had desperately been trying for a baby for five years, first falling pregnant in  - but they tragically suffered an ectopic pregnancy. It was the start of years of further heartache, with  miscarriages that led to a host of operations and tests for Carla in a bid to find out why her pregnancies were not continuing. Now Carla, a former recruitment manager, firmly believes the boys were a gt from God after watching her mum suffer secondary breast cancer before passing away just two weeks before Carlaaposs pregnancy was confirmed. The -year-old told Lanarkshire Live : In  I had an ectopic pregnancy, I then went on to have  miscarriages over the space of five years.During all this I was diagnosed with an over-active thyroid which they thought could be causing the miscarriages, so I had an operation in  to remove my full thyroid. But after the procedure I still continued to miscarry. So, I got in touch with the charity Tommy’s, which helps women who suffer from infertility. They offered to pay for me to get tests done down in Birmingham and in  I travelled to the All Women’s hospital where I got a number of tests done which all came back normal, so it was really frustrating. I was then referred to a gynaecologist at Wishaw General and she forwarded me to the infertility clinic at Monklands where myself and Stephen attended for a number of tests, which again all came back normal.  Then on March  last year, the day before we went into lockdown I had tests to check for endometriosis, to check my fallopian tubes and also my uterus, which again was all fine. It was then that everything was put down as unexplained infertility. Last April, Carla was offered the chance to be put on the IVF waiting list. Her joy at this was tempered as her mum was still fighting secondary breast cancer and the family had been told the disease was terminal. Carla continued: We found out that mumaposs cancer wasn’t curable, but it was treatable. She was the strongest lady I have ever met, but sadly she lost her battle on July , . The strangest thing though was that three days before she passed, she told me I was pregnant and asked when I was due. We had absolutely no idea and I suppose just brushed it off.  Two weeks after my mumaposs funeral, I found out I was pregnant naturally, no IVF needed, with our identical twins. I truly believe mum sent me these miracles. And despite nine months of worry, Blane was born at .am on March  weighing lbs oz, and Blair was lbs oz at am. Carla and Stephen are now enjoying le at home with their miracle boys and are currently planning their wedding. Carla added: During my pregnancy I attended the twin clinic every two weeks with Dr Evelyn Ferguson and her wonderful team - I canapost thank them all enough for their care.

When Annette Woollam started suffering from memory loss and speech problems she put it down to ‘anxiety and nerves’ due to her having cancer treatment. The -year-old had just begun immunotherapy for lung cancer and noticed she had began to struggle with communicating and her memory had deteriorated. However one morning when she woke up terried and had no words she suspected something sinister. Annette was at her home in Chester, Cheshire, on her own as her husband had left for work when the aposscaryapos incident happened.She told the Liverpool Echo : “It was a gradual process, I had noticed the week leading up to my total breakdown that I was struggling with words and couldnapost find certain words in my mind. “Then on that day when it happened I was at home alone, my husband had left for work. “It was terrying and itaposs not something you wish on anyone. “So I put it down to being a bit anxious because I didnapost know what to expect so I wasnapost worried too much about my speech. “But then after a week, one morning when I woke up and basically my thinking wasn’t working and then also not being able to find the words. It was scary.” She added: “It got to the point where I couldn’t remember my address or even my date of birth. I was so scared I didn’t know what was happening.” Annette was able to ring  and the emergency operator realised she was struggling to communicate and sent her an ambulance.  She said: “I don’t know how they found me, but I am so grateful, and the operator stayed on the line until they arrived. “I was able to leave a message on my husband’s phone, it probably didn’t make much sense.”Annette was sent to The Walton Centre, in Liverpool, for urgent neurosurgery, where consultant neurosurgeon Andrew Brodbelt found a tumour in her brain which he urgently removed.The tumour was found in the speech and language centre of her brain which explained Annetteaposs speech and memory problems. After the surgery Annetteaposs cognitive skills soon ed to normal. The account administrator said: “I was so relieved that Mr Brodbelt was able to remove it so quickly and effectively. When I went for my follow-up appointment I wanted to give him a big hug for all he’s done – and I would’veit weren’t for the social distancing rules.

I asked a couple of guys standing there to roll her over onto her back. “You could see she had a massive injury to the right side of her head and there was a lot of blood coming from her mouth. “My sister-in-law, who is a teacher and knows CPR, tried about  compressions and then the ambulance arrived. “At first I thought she had been the driver of the car and I saw car keys on the ground beside the vehicle, but the I was told by someone there that the driver had run off. “One of the men who was first on the scene had held her hand and she looked at him as she took her last breath and passed away. “She took that same route every day at the same time to pick up her little girl.” Haris, Mrs Shehzadi’s nephew, said: “It has hit the family, especially her children, really hard. “She was a very good lady who always kept herself to herself.

After a complicated orce from husband Steve in January , she eventually made the decision in February  to move. She left with her two oldest children from that marriage to a dferent part of the country to live with her new husband, Jeff, and their shared daughter Journey.  Her children struggled with the move and so Liz made the heartbreaking decision to let them move back to their fatheraposs house in Kansas, US, in June . But after this she felt a sense of loss and anxiety about how much of her childrenaposs lives she would miss out on. So she entered the world of reborn baby dolls, and her collection began, buying her first doll in December  - just five months after her children moved back in with her ex-husband. Now, she is the proud mum to nine reborn baby dolls who all have their own names: Juniper Anne, Willa Jane, Nixon Grey, Benedict Arthur, Jax Ethan, Crevan Ridge, Paisley Rye, Isla Blu, and Oaklyn Elise.  Liz has dedicated an entire room in her house to a nursery for her reborn dolls which includes a crib, a wardrobe, a changing table, and shelving to store nappies, baby toiletries and accessories. Making the decision for [children] Dylan and Asher to live with their father was one of the hardest decisions Iaposve ever made, said Liz. It was like giving my children up for adoption. In the back of my head, I had haunting thoughts like, aposWill they even remember that they spent half of their childhood living in my home apos and, aposWill my other two children remember the times we shared and grow up being close to their older brother and sister apos Every day it feels like death. Every day, I think about the moments that Iaposve missed. It haunts me. It keeps me up late at night with panic attacks sometimes.

A lack of international leadership, an eight-day delay in declaring a global emergency and reluctance to impose travel restrictions are among the key findings by an independent report commissioned by the World Health Organisation. Calling for wide-ranging reforms to the WHO and for an international council to be established to transform preparation and response, the report lays out bold measures to make the current global crisis the last pandemic. The situation we find ourselves in today could have been prevented,  co-chair Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said at the launch of the report. It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response.Here are the key errors that created a toxic cocktail for the spread of coronavirus.Eight-day delay in declaring global emergency Chinese authorities first confirmed they were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia sparked by an unknown cause in Wuhan on December , . At the time, there was no evidence the virus could be rapidly spread by humans, but the report suggests the World Health Organisation was slow to act as the disease gained momentum.  “Clinicians in Wuhan acted quickly when they recognised iniduals in a cluster of pneumonia cases that were not normal,” said Sirleaf, adding that the alert was quickly picked up by neighbouring countries and the media. “This shows the benefit and speed of open-source reporting, but then the systems that were meant to validate and respond to this alert were too slow. The alert system does not operate with sufficient speed when faced with a fast-moving respiratory pathogen.” The report suggests the World Health Organisation was hindered by regulations that need rethinking and should have declared a global health emergency by January  - eight days before it eventually did so.On January , a -year-old woman suffering a fever, cough and sore throat arrived from Wuhan in the UK, before being confirmed as Britainaposs first coronavirus case.By the time a global emergency was declared, the virus has already spread to countries including Thailand and the US, with around  confirmed cases and  reported dead. aposLost monthapos of February Following the declaration, however, the report suggests too many countries were slow to act and tighten their borders, meaning February was a lost month in the fight against the virus. If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly, more widely, again that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the disease, said the aposs co-chair Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand.  New Zealandaposs quick response to the virus was hailed as an early success story in the pandemic, with the nation currently reporting only  Covid deaths since the outbreak began. On February , a man in the Philippines became the first person outside China to die of Covid-. New Zealand banned entries to any foreigners coming from or through the country, while forcing nationals ing from there to isolate for  days. The UKaposs response was less severe. Between January and March , Britain imposed quarantine measures on  people travelling from Wuhan, while asking travellers from high-risk countries including China, Iran and Northern Italy to voluntarily isolate for  days. However, these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on March  -  days before the UK went into lockdown. The report adds: “Countries with the ambition to aggressively contain and stop the spread whenever and wherever it occurs have shown that this is possible. Reckless leaders aposdevalued scienceapos International leaders who devalued science have also been criticised by the study, which claims they denied the potential impact of the pandemic, delayed comprehensive action, and allowed distrust to undermine efforts.Arguably the most high profile example was former US president Donald Trump, who was widely rebuked for his downplaying of and outright denial of the virus.In January , after the first Covid case in the US was confirmed, he said: “It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” The next month he boasted, It’s going to disappear. One day – it’s like a miracle – it will disappear, later prompting outcry for suggesting the virus could be combated by injecting bleach.  The US currently has recorded , Covid deaths, the highest rate in the world, followed by Brazil on , deaths. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro infamously railed against other nationaposs lockdown measures as the pandemic unfolded, saying of the virus: Itaposs just a little flu or the snfles. Speaking in late March , he stood firm against calls for tougher measures, insisting: “Our lives have to go on. Jobs must be kept... We must, yes, get back to normal. The countryaposs slow vaccination rollout has since seen Bolsonaroaposs regime accused of “homicidal negligence” by the Brazilian press. Sceptical leaders from nations also including Tanzania and Turkmenistan - whose president suggested a herb could keep the virus at bay - were dubbed the aposostrich allianceapos for burying their heads in the sand. aposWinner takes allapos battle for PPE Many nations were unprepared for a pandemic and only spurred into action when hospital ICU beds began to fill, said Clark. She added: By then it was too late to avert the pandemicaposs impact. What followed then was a winner takes all scramble for PPE and therapeutics. Globally, health workers were tested to their limits and the rates of infection, illness and death soared and continue to soar.” Last May, the Mirror told how doctors completely ran out of essential items of PPE while fighting on the NHS frontline.One ICU doctor working at a London hospital said: “I have had to treat patients without a gown on because we have completely run out. Just my scrubs, with gloves and a mask. “One member of staff has stopped coming to work because her mum has Type  diabetes and without PPE, she’s terried she’ll infect her. I often find myself standing in front of a patient, knowing I’m not protected enough.”A report by thealso found that government stockpiles containing protective equipment for healthcare workers in the event of a pandemic fell in value by almost  per cent in the six years up to .aposPandemic of inequalityapos The aposs experts warn that Covid- has been a pandemic of inequality, exacerbated between and within countries. The crisis has been particularly devastating in impoverished nations like India, where tens of millions of residents have been plunged into poverty since the outbreak.

After a month of observing daily fasts from sunrise to sunset we are ready to feast with loved ones. For my family, however, it will be a solemn occasion as it will be the first Eid without my father who passed away just three weeks ago. He was the one who would cook up Eid specialities and tasty treats for us- taking on the mantle ever since my mother passed away five years ago. But today I feel the searing loss of not only my father but of the many innocent lives lost in this latest act of Israeli aggression. And I’m not the only one. My social media feed would normally be a constant stream of Eid recipes or make-up tutorials or young women showing off their hairstyles and henna designs in preparation of the big day. But instead young people - of all faiths, races and background - are highlighting the human rights abuses in Palestine. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  The conflict in this region is nothing new but in recent days it has become deadlier than ever and it seems to be young people who are shouting the loudest to bring the issue to attention. The Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem is the third holiest site for Muslims and of such signicance it merits a mention in the Holy book, the Quran. To storm in and fire rubber bullets at worshippers is abhorrent. If a ‘Muslim’ did the same thing to a place of worship we would rightly call them a terrorist so why is it okaythe state of Israel does it  And despite the fact that the United Nations has repeatedly declared that the settlers are violating international law, the expansion keeps happening.  This isn’t about Muslims against Jews either. We share many aspects of our faiths and God has told us that Jews are People of the Book like us. They are our brethren. I have heard many impassioned speeches by practising Jews who have spoken out against the Israeli regime. One of the most powerful was a Jewish man who said his entire family on both sides had been wiped out by the Holocaust.

In the images, filmed live in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, a driver is seen crashing into another car before being pulled out and savagely beaten by a mob. Emergency services were reported to have arrived  minutes later as the man lay motionless and bloodied on his back in the middle of the street. More explosions have been heard tonight as Israel carries out air strikes on the Gaza strip in response to Hamas rocket attacks. At least  people have died in the violence since it erupted on Monday, with the UN now warning of an all-out war.US President Joe Biden has said Israel has a right to defend itself against the Hamas attacks but voiced confidence that the violence would soon stop. The shocking video recorded in Bat Yam, a suburb of Tel Aviv, was broadcast on Channel  before cutting to an appeal by President Reuven Rivlin to please stop this madness. The victim of the lynching is seriously injured but stable, Tel Avivaposs Ichilov hospital was later reported to have said in a statement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Netanyahu issued a video statement in which he pledged to grant police emergency powers for a crackdown. This violence is not who we are, he said. I donapost careyour bloodaposs boiling. It comes as violence escalated between Israel and Hamas amid warnings from the UN that the region is heading for aposall out war.aposPresident Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said he was hopeful that a cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians would end soon. My expectation and hope is this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself, he told reporters at the White House. Netanyahuaposs office said he told the U.S. president that Israel would continue acting to strike at the military capabilities of Hamas and the other terrorist groups active in the Gaza Strip. Early on Thursday Hamas launched rockets at Tel Aviv and toward Jerusalem and Israel vowed to keep pummelling the Islamist faction in Gaza. The Israeli military said that some  of , rockets fired by Gaza factions had fallen short, potentially causing some Palestinian civilian casualties.  At least  people have been killed in Gaza since violence exploded on Monday, according to the enclaveaposs health ministry. Seven people have been killed in Israel, medical officials said. Hamas signalled defiance, with its leader, Ismail Haniyeh, saying: The confrontation with the enemy is open-ended. It comes after Israeli forces killed a senior Hamas commander and bombed several buildings, including high-rises and a bank, which Israel said was linked to the factionaposs activities, on Wednesday. In the most intensive violence in years jets bombed Gaza and Hamas said it had fired hundreds of rockets at Israel including the city of Tel Aviv.  One multi-storey residential building in Gaza collapsed and another was heavily damaged after they were repeatedly hit by Israeli air strikes. During those strikes at least  people were killed, including  children, in Gaza, and three in Israel. Israel has gone crazy, said a man on a Gaza street, where people ran out of their homes as explosions rocked buildings. Many in Israel also holed up in shelters as waves of rockets hit its heartland, some blown out of the sky by Iron Dome interceptors.

I certainly play on it a ton, because it is so much fun.“I personally think the monkey bars are the best, but the rest is still really, really, really good.”And fellow pupil Ava wrote: “We absolutely love the equipment, thank you so much.“We love playing on the equipment, it makes us fit and healthy and now that it is finished we can all be happy and have lots of fun.”Outdoor activities have become an important part of school le because of the coronavirus pandemic.Head teacher Kate Milne said the new addition will help pupils explore new ways to play together.She said: “We are delighted by this generous donation from Miller Homes, and really appreciate them helping us to fund this fantastic new play area.“It’s been wonderful to see so many of the children enjoying the equipment together and finding new ways to play and connect during the school day.”Miller Homes are responsible for the new Sycamore Dell development which is located in the local Lf village, on the outskirts of Dundee.Neil Gaffney, sales and marketing director for the firm, said: “We’re delighted to support Lf Primary School with this donation, and to see the positive impact that the new play park is having on pupil’s health and wellbeing.“It’s so important to us that we can continue to support the local communities around our developments wherever we can and we’re delighted that the children of Lf Primary School are enjoying their new play park so much.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2021/04/20104364_38711820-e1619519631275-940x564.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee fans get stocked up

stocking up on whatever vice they need to relieve stress.Because this next few days are colossal ones for the future of their club.I’m no Dee but even I am glad I’ll have a laptop to hide behind when the play-off tension becomes unbearable.I can only see these two matches against Raith Rovers being cagey affairs.There will be plenty of the apocryphal hiding behind sofas and chewing of fingernails for Dark Blues unable to peel their eyes from the TV.They are very dficult games to call.And results between the teams this season only strengthens that argument – one draw and a win each.I’ve written about set-pieces, good and bad for Dundee, and I’d expect they could even be the dference come Saturday night.Four of Raith’s five goals against the Dark Blues have come, sometimes indirectly, from set-plays.While Dundee have the newly-crowned award king of Dens Park Lee Ashcroft powering in on every delivery.And his partner Liam Fontaine hasn’t been found wanting in the goals stakes either.Saying that, former Dee Kyle Benedictus has scored three goals this season, two of them against his old side.Play-off football is often about the slim margins. With that comes nerve-shredding tension and a desperate need from players not to be the one that messes things up at this late stage.That sort of pressure seems simple to talk about for us.For the players, it could be a moment that spoils – or indeed elevates – an entire year’s work.But that drama is why we love football.And the introduction of the play-offs a few years back injected much-needed le into our lower leagues.That’s for next week, though.A next week Dundee need to ensure they are still alive and kicking for.I’ve very much enjoyed the ‘pressure’ talk between the two managers, James McPake and John McGlynn trying to ramp things up on each other.There’s no doubt, though, that the Dark Blues are expected to get through.The question is now whether the Dundee squad has the characters to stand up in the face of that sort of expectation.From my personal viewpoint, they do – but the only way it can be proved is by winning this tie.Over the league season, Dundee showed they are a better team than Rovers by finishing above them.They have better, more experienced players.For a lot of the season, though, I’d say Raith had a better team. As in a collective unit working together.A big test for me will be how the Dark Blues begin the game after  days without a match.Whatever happens, it’s going to be a tense  minutes .Get prepared Dees.Dundee United’s season is over now, isn’t it I had big hopes they’d be able to rise to the occasion on Saturday.However, they didn’t really give themselves a foothold in the semi-final against Hibs.It was a performance that badly needed an inidual spark from somebody.But there hasn’t been a huge amount of that this season from the Tangerines.It’s been a decent campaign from Micky Mellon’s men, don’t get me wrong.However, attacking style and verve hasn’t been a word associated with them often.The quarter-final apart, I guess – and I don’t buy the ‘Aberdeen were awful’ story either.Yes, the opposition was poor but United most certainly weren’t.However, that day has only been a flash in the pan it seems.By the time I write my next column, their season will be over with games against Motherwell and St Mirren left tonight and Saturday.A weekend clash between the two beaten semi-finalists does not sound a cheery affair.What United need to do now, though, is look ahead to next season.Give some youngsters a chance in these two games to show they can be part of the squad next term.And try to finish off what has been a definite step in the right direction on a positive note.It’s always a shame to see players miss out on major tournaments through injury.Sadly it’s been a story Scotland fans haven’t had to put up with for a long, long time!Looks like Kenny McLean and Ryan Jack will miss the Euros.Disappointing for them but thankfully we are very well-stocked in quality central midfielders.Whether either of those would make Steve Clarke’s first XI is up for debate.What it does is open the door for the likes of Billy Gilmour and David Turnbull.Players like those two are the future of the team. LEE WILKIE: I wouldn#t be surprisedLee Ashcroft is Dundee#s main man again for the play-offs and disappointment after Dundee United#s lacklustre semi showing\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: I wouldn#t be surprisedLee Ashcroft is Dundee#s main man again for the play-offs and disappointment after Dundee United#s lacklustre semi showing# #

perform a new composition alongside  other bagpipers from across the Commonwealth during next June’s festivities to mark the th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.Mr Johnston will play at the Princess Royal and Duke of Fe Memorial Park in Braemar, the location of the annual Braemar Gathering, which has been cancelled for a second time this year.The -year-old will perform simultaneously alongside the other  pipers selected from across the globe, each playing in their home countries.Mr Johnston, who is a piper in the Lonach Pipe Band, said: “I was very honoured, especially because I’ve been the official Braemar Royal Highland Society piper for the past  years, so it’s great to be recognised.“There’s  of us all together, all chosen right throughout the whole of the world.“Each piper that’s been chosen to play has had to pick their own destination to play the tune, so because I’ve been involved with the Braemar Royal Highland Society for so long it was only fitting that I chose the Duke of Fe Memorial Park in Braemar, the home of the gathering.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

And she is encouraging parents to have their children#s feet professionally measured as soon as possible.Lisa is the founder of Bob and Lulu, a specialist fitted shoe shop, gt and clothing boutique based in the West End of Aberdeen.And she has shown her support for Aberdeen # Grampian Chamber of Commerce’s North East Now initiative – supported by creative agency Hampton and Aberdeen Journals – as it also aims to promote local businesses battling through the Covid- pandemic.#We pride ourselves on doing more than selling shoes and clothes,# she said. #We provide a health service for children’s feet.#I am extremely committed to educating my customers and the wider public on children’s foot health – it is a vitally important component for future foot health as adults.#I find that there is far too much emphasis on the ‘size’ of the shoe when there are in fact so many other factors to consider including width, material and brand.#Me and my team are consistent, experienced and knowledgeable. We know our brands and we can tell just by looking at a child’s foot which brand will be the best fit for their shape of foot.#I am passionate about breathing new le into the measure and fit trade. As a parent to two young children myself, I know we all place a huge emphasis on our children’s health and wellbeing from what they eat to how much time they spend on technology.#Our children’s foot health plays such an important role in their overall health and physical comfort day-to-day.#The correct fitting shoes will benefit our little people’s development in supporting their growing bones and changing foot shape. Healthy feet can impact everything from good posture to ankle, knee and hip strength.#I am hopeful that shoe fitting is perceived as even more valuable after being in lockdown for so long without access to this type of service.#I always say ‘your feet are your pension’ – look after your feet and they will look after you.#Lisa launched Bob and Lulu in  after taking over the business from its previous owners and undergoing a rebrand.She has spent a great deal of time ersying her services over the past year, including offering an outdoor shoe fitting service.Lisa said: #I was keen for the shop to undergo a revival so I set about a rebranding mission to give it a fresh, modern look and changed the name to Bob and Lulu.#The shop is named after my gorgeous dog Bob and his best friend Lulu, whose owner is also one of my best friends and has been a huge help and supporter of me and my business.#I ersied by introducing a range of baby and children’s clothing so that my customers could visit the boutique for a complete outfit for their little ones.#I#ve also had to ersy since the coronavirus outbreak too. In the first instance, my team and I knew we had to focus more heavily on our online service so we increased the range of shoes on our website.#We had to accept early on that it was the only way to continue trading throughout lockdown. But at the end of the day, our mission is focused on seeing the children in person and physically measuring their feet, so we had to get creative.#During the first lockdown in March , Bob and Lulu started up a delivery service.#We would take shoes to our customer’s doors and have the children try on the shoes from a safe two-meter distance and we would give advice from afar.#We as a team were there to reassure parents and provide the best possible service despite the dficult circumstances.#We also have children who come to see us who may have orthotics or have hypermobility and they require a specialist service, so it was important for us to continue working for those children who require extra foot support.#As businesses begin to reopen their doors to the public, Lisa is urging people across the north-east to do what they can to support their local communities.Lisa said: “North East Now is an excellent  for small businesses like ours to showcase what we have to offer.“It’s great to see North East Now championing businesses across the city and beyond and Bob and Lulu is delighted to be featured alongside other local businesses as we have welcomed customers back into our stores.#As we all know, retail including major stores have been hit hard recently and the same can be said locally here in Aberdeen.#With the loss of these major stores amid an ever-changing high street landscape, shopping habits have changed with consumers enjoying the ease of ordering everything they need with the simple click of a button from the comfort of their own homes.#However, for Bob and Lulu, we are more than just a shop. We represent the true essence of shop local.#We love being a part of a family’s journey from watching their toddlers take those first tentative steps to when they step into school on their first day – school shoes, particularly for the first day of school are a major milestone purchase and we feel honoured to play a part in making these precious memories.#Our shop is situated opposite Ashley Road primary school which is so nice as we often have children stop and tap on the window to wave to us and they send in pictures of what they have drawn of their first day of school. It’s super lovely to be a part of a community.#The ‘shop local’ movement is fantastic, but it’s not enough to simply talk about shopping local or to hashtag ‘shop local’ on our social media s.#We actually have to physically shop local. We need our customers back # we need their physical presence back in our shops to help us get back up and running again.#I understand some people are wary about shopping safely, but when they see the measures in place to ensure it is safe to shop again, we can provide that comfort and confidence.#It’s time to bring back the personal touch to the shopping experience.#Going forward, my aim is to continue to spread the educational importance of children’s foot health.#For more information on Bob and Lulu, visit www.bobandluluFor more on the North East Now initiative, visit northeastnow.scotTo share your positive business story, email stories@northeastnow.scotFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/injecting-scotland-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

entered Strathfillan. Itrsquos named after Saint Fillan and the healing pool associated with him was their next destination. Izzy pulled Bess into a minor road and found a parking place.ldquoItrsquos not far, she said, pointing to a sign that said Holy Pool.Finn raised his eyebrows, giving her a sceptical look her concept of not far was dferent to his!ldquoNo, really, this time it isnrsquot, she assured him. ldquoThe pool is just over there, a very short walk through the trees.The morning was lting and Izzy wandered to a nearby small hillock to take in the view. The mountain tops were still mostly hidden under blankets of mist, but small breaks in the cloud were giving tantalising glimpses of Ben More and Ben Lui.Finn joined his aunt.She spoke to her nephew while looking out to the landscape: ldquoA strath is a river valley, Finn, and the river here flows to Loch Dochart. This is Strathfillan, itrsquos named after the saint of that name who came and settled here to preach his religion, before Scotland even existed.ldquoYou mean the saint whose magic healing stones we saw at the mill in Killin Izzy nodded with a very pleased smile, happy hersquod remembered.ldquoYes, thatrsquos him. This part of the river is called Fillanrsquos Water, itrsquos where the healing pool is.Finn was impatient: ldquoLetrsquos go there now, I want to swim in it!They walked through a small wood of twisted birch trees, their leaves lightly touched by the yellow of autumn. The moment Finn entered the wood, he could sense the place had a mysterious air to it. The path zigzagged down to the river and within a couple of minutes they reached the edge of the pool.It wasnrsquot quite what he had expected: a bulge in the river, where the flow of the peaty water slowed, making a deep and calm natural basin. Finn stared at the deep brown water, it was too dark to see anything underneath the surface. It had an almost eerie feeling to it, yet at the same time was quietly inviting.ldquoThis is a place of myth making and history, Izzy said as she sat by the riverbank to set up her stove. Soon its hissing filled the air. She sipped her coffee, waiting for Finn to join her. He took an apple from her rucksack and sat next to her. He wanted to know about this place.ldquoIt was probably a sacred place even before St Fillan and Christianity came here, she said. She explained how the early Celts venerated water and places such as this were associated with their gods and of the spirituality within nature itself.Then she told him stories about St Fillan of how his ox was killed by a wolf, but that afterwards the wolf ed. The saint forgave the creature and to make amends it agreed to be yoked and pull the plough that had been the job of the ox.Finn spoke up: ldquoBut the wolf didnrsquot do anything wrong, surely  It was a wolf after all and the ox was prey, itrsquos what wolves do.ldquoThatrsquos true, Finn, but it is a tale made to show how miraculous his god was. There were many of them. Another was that St Fillan had a bell that could magically fly and also his left arm could shine in the dark, giving him light to read and write at night.ldquoHe sounds more like a superhero, remarked Finn.Izzy chuckled: ldquoYeah, I suppose that was the idea, it was a way of showing people the power of god and of course people at the time really believed these stories. St Fillanrsquos arm bone became a relic called the Mayne, and there is a story that it was taken to Bannockburn on the orders of Robert the Bruce to help him win the battle.Finn knew about Robert the Bruce and wanted to hear the tale of the Mayne. Izzy told it with humour, how the arm bone appeared miraculously, to the surprise of the abbot, who had been afraid to bring it in case it got lost.Finn looked at the pool: ldquoSo according to these stories, he used his powers to make the water here magical ldquoYep, said Izzy, drinking the last of her coffee. ldquoItrsquos mostly forgotten now, but for hundreds of years this was a place of pilgrimage where people came to be cured. The water was said to cure people of mental health problems. She explained the bizarre ritual of how people were submerged in the pool and given the task of finding stones from the river bed, then spent a night tied up in the nearby priory.Finn laughed out loud at the image of it all.Well, I donrsquot believe the stories, said Finn, ldquobut Irsquod still like to swim in the pool and seeI can find some stones.Izzy knew she would have to go in with him. She had brought their swimming gear and towels just in case, and soon they were howling and shrieking as they lowered themselves into the cold water. Within a minute, their bodies numbed to it and they began to swim.Trees lined both banks and they got a good view of the modern bridge further up the river. Finn watched as cars, tour buses and campervans sped over it, passing without a glance.He stayed in the water longer than his aunt, swimming in circles, then exploring the far side of the river. He managed to get three pebbles from the shallower section of the pool on its eastern edge. As he emerged shivering, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, giving welcome and timely warmth as he dried himself.ldquoI get it now, said Finn, laughing. ldquoYou actually have to be mad to go in there in the first place!He studied the stones in his hand, then looked up: ldquoI know a story about Robert the Bruce.He told his story wrapped in a large towel, his hair still wet and dripping. It was the story of Bruce and the spider, and he told it beautully, under the shade of the birch trees next to the ancient healing pool. The only interruption was birdsong. Now Izzy was the listener and Finn the storyteller. It was an incredibly special moment.ldquoItrsquos a story about not giving up, explained Finn after hersquod finished telling it. ldquoMaybe it didnrsquot happen exactly that way, but itrsquos still got truth in it. He gave his aunt a big smile.His words spoke directly to her, in a way he wouldnrsquot understand. She glanced towards the trees for a moment, then ed Finnrsquos big smile.ldquoFantastic telling, Finn. And you know what  One of the battles he was defeated in took place just over there, at a place called Dalrigh, the field of the king. She pointed to beyond the bridge. ldquoHe was being hunted by his enemies and nearly got killed in the battle. At least he escaped with his le to later meet the spider! According to legend, he threw his sword into a small loch as he fled. His followers did the same and itrsquos been called Lochan nam Arm ever since, which means loch of the weapons. Some say Brucersquos sword still lies in the mud there, which is why people also call it the Loch of the Sword.Finn was excited by this connection. He wanted to see the loch, maybe he could even find the sword! Hersquod once been to Bannockburn visitor centre, it had been a fun day out. But here, history felt so much closer, more real, although he couldnrsquot put into words why.Izzy agreed they could have lunch at Lochan nam Arm. As she packed up, Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge and dropped one of the pebbles back into the pool. He watched as the circular ripples expanded on the calm surface, finally vanishing. He did the same with the second pebble, again watching the ripples the splash had made.Then he spoke, while still studying the water.ldquoMy dad once told me that le is a stone thrown into the water: it leaves ripples long after it has vanished.Izzy froze, saying nothing in case she chose the wrong words.Finn looked at the third stone still in his hand. Instead of throwing it into the water, he hurled it into the wood. It bounced off the trunk of a birch tree, then fell into the undergrowth.ldquoBut he was wrong because some stones just vanish, like that one, thatrsquos all they do, because they are not worth anything. Finnrsquos mood had suddenly changed.ldquoI hated that stone, he said with anger in his voice.Izzy stood up. ldquoFinn, she said softly, holding out her arms, offering a hug.He just turned and walked up the path towards the car, picking up a stick and hitting the trees with it.ldquoI hate him, I hate him, he screamed.Izzyrsquos stomach sank. Her mind raced over what had happened, what had been the trigger, was it something she had said Then she realised.She walked up the path and found Finn by the car, looking out to the mountains which now framed the near horizon all around them.ldquoYou OK, sweetie  You want to talk Finn shook his head.ldquoI want to phone my mum, he eventually replied.ldquoOf course, therersquos a phone at Tyndrum, just down the road. Letrsquos seewe can get hold of her, it will be nearly lunchtime where she is, so maybe she will be free.Finn noticed the sign for Dalrigh, then minutes later they arrived at Tyndrum.Luckily, Finnrsquos mum was able to come to the phone.As Finn spoke with his mum, Izzy saw Ewen pull up at the petrol station. He was in a dferent car and wearing a jacket with a hood half pulled over his face, but she knew it was him. He was being very careful, as shersquod asked him to be. She didnrsquot know how much hersquod seen and heard by the pool.How to tell him shersquod decided it may be best to abandon the whole trip, take Finn back home and wait there for his mum and stepdad to . It just felt too risky and she was worried about Finn. She knew Ewen would be devastated.Finn hung up and seemed happier after the call.ldquoI was thinking we might head back to your home today, Finn. You know, with lights and TV and normal stuff, said Izzy with a smile and a wink.Finnrsquos reaction wasnrsquot what she expected.ldquoWhy, aunty  Irsquom sorry I got angry, but Irsquom OK now. You promised me an adventure to Loch Ness, why are you giving up and breaking your promise So they walked to Lochan nam Arm. Izzy told the story of Brucersquos escape from the MacDougalls and they both made lunch together by a patch of late flowering foxgloves. Some walkers on the West Highland Way passed them, but mostly they had the loch side to themselves.Finn didnrsquot find the sword of Robert the Bruce, of course.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"musician-records-sounds-north-berwick-new-album-series-depicting-seven-continents","story":"Ted White, who was brought up on Cromwell Road, where parents Sally and Andrew still live, was approached by music distribution service Platoon to co-ordinate field recordings he had gathered around the world over several years and release them via Apple last month.Each of the seven albums is dedicated to a dferent continent, and the sounds of North Berwickrsquos beaches and harbour feature on the Europe: Earth Sounds album.Ted, , said: ldquoI travel a lot, recording sounds around the world, and Platoon and I collectively came up with the concept of collating my recordings of the past seven years into continents of the world.ldquoI did a bit more travelling to record the bits I didnrsquot have.A former student at Loretto now splitting his time between Liverpool and London, Ted came back to North Berwick to capture the seaside townrsquos night-time atmosphere.He said: ldquoI grew up there so I knew where I could get good sounds without the noise pollution that you get in London.ldquoI recorded lots of midnight sounds on the beaches.

Bees and other pollinating insects will be on the hunt at other times of year too,\" says Perry. \"Spring nectar sources can help pollinators to refuel after their hibernation period, and in autumn it can help them build energy reserves for the winter months. Be sure to plant with the widest range of blooming periods in mind, so the wildle never goes hungry.\"The calendar is designed to help gardeners of all abilities turn their outdoor spaces into a pollinator paradise all year round, buzzing with a riot of colour, texture and scent and a perfect way to contribute to World Bee Day .These are some of the plants which Perry recommends to help bees through all four seasons...SPRINGLungwort - the lovely lungwort flower grows low to the ground, and blooms early to bring food to the first pollinators of spring. They grow best in containers, so theyre great for planting in a small space.Peony - these pink beauties are rich in pollen, and pollinating insects love their single blooms. Plant your peonies in rich, dry soil in the sun.Magnolia - our buzzing buddies are drawn to the magnicent magnolias saucer-sized blooms, and love to snack on their sweet nectar. Magnolias love sun and acid soil with lots of moisture.Pussy willow - pussy willow pollen is high in protein, and the spring bloom provides an early source of nutrition for our busy friends.SUMMERLavender - At home in a Mediterranean style garden and also in pots or as a low hedge for potagers, lavender produces both pollen and nectar, making it a great food source for honey bees. They even create lavender-flavoured honey from the plant. Lavender does well in full sun in sandy or chalky, well-drained soil - nothing thats too rich.Foxglove - honey bees and bumblebees work together to pollinate this classic cottage garden favourite. The bumblebee creates holes in the side of the flower to make it easier for the honey bee to swoop in and access the flowers pollen.Hawthorn - our hive heroes can make dark and rich honey from hawthorn nectar. This flower grows best in sunny conditions and is tolerant of all soil types.Marjoram - marjoram is a favourite of humans and our pollinating pals alike - these nectar-rich flowers are actually a perennial herb and close relative of oregano.AUTUMNAster - these pretty perennials with daisy-like flowers ying from purple, violet, and lavender to pink with orange-yellow centres, need lots of water. Its worth adding a mulch to retain the moisture, but theyre worth it to keep the bees happy and help honey bees build up reserves of pollen for winter to get them through the cold months. Plant asters in full sun for them to shine.Honeysuckle - This fast-growing climber, which can be deciduous or evergreen, bearing blooms ranging from creamy-white through yellow to red, is famed for its powerful scent and is a magnet for bees. It starts to flower in the summer but can continue to autumn, given the right conditions. It prefers a sunny spot and isnt fussy about the soil.Single-bloom dahlias - If youre wanting to attract bees, go for the single bloom types of dahlia such as the Happy Single Series over the other ieties such as pompoms or balls, which are less accessible to insects.Sedum - Their pretty flowerheads are full of nectar which makes these low-growing perennials perfect for the front of a border or in prairie plantings, flowering right through to October. Sedum flowers are perfect for honey bees as a late source of pollen and nectar, helping to build up honey stores for the colder winter.WINTERWinter aconite - these low-growing small tuberous perennials from the buttercup family produce bright yellow cup-shaped flowers which are good for ground cover and provide a burst of winter and spring colour under shrubs and roses.Mahonia - Clusters of highly scented bright yellow flowers appear in winter on these tough, spiky evergreen shrubs which are easy to grow, produce lots of nectar and also provide purple to black berries in the autumn, a feast for the birds.Helleborus - hellebores provide sugar-rich nectar and high-protein pollen to help keep the bees energetic and strong through the middle of winter. They thrive in alkaline soil and their subtle shades ranging from cream to deep purple will bring le to a darker area, as they are tolerant of shade.Snowdrop - these pint-sized beauties are among the first bulbs to emerge in winter, providing rich nectar when other food is hard to find. Plant dferent ieties which flower at dferent times in winter to give the bees a longer foraging season.Crocus - these hardy flowers can break through ice and snow to bring food to winter honey bees. Plant them in the sun so that the flowers will fully open and make it easier for the bees to forage on the nectar. Crocuses naturalise well so can create carpets of colourful flowers in winter.For more information on the Hives For Lives programme visit rowsehoney."},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-rhubarb-strawberry-double-crust-pie---perfect-alfresco-tea-party","story":"Ingredientsg rhubarb tablespoons muscovado sugarZest of an unwaxed lemon and a squeeze of juice teaspoon grated fresh ginger strawberriesFor the pastryg self-rising flour, sievedg ground almondsg caster sugarPinch of saltg cold unsalted butter, cubed free range egg yolk-  tablespoons iced waterA little milk to wash.A -cm oven-proof plate, well butteredPrepare the fillingWash and trim the rhubarb and cut into pieces.

When a lot is at stake, a lot of people turn out.Results still to come, of course. But let us work for now on the very reasonable assumption that Nicola Sturgeon will be ing to work on Monday as the First Minister of Scotland. What will immediately confront her Self-evidently, the Covid crisis ndash and its concomitant economic challenges. However, along with that, she will have to form a new Cabinet.

In addition, elections tend to generate involuntary departures.

Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints.

Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref.

Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

The grim and dficult period during the parliamentary inquiry and the apparent fragmentation of the independence movement, combined with a failing policy agenda and the wear and tear of  years in government did not generate an inspiring context for what was billed by many as the most important election since devolution.Add to that a year of pandemic uncertainty and the accompanying restrictions preventing rallies, canvassing and public meetings, building momentum and excitement in these circumstances is not an easy thing to achieve.Yet we saw record turnouts. And despite a rocky period, Nicola Sturgeon s as an immeasurably strengthened First Minister. Some have argued that the SNP, having just missed an outright majority, failed to meet its electoral objective. But this was always a more unlikely possibility.It has without doubt been a triumph for the party ndash and especially its leadership. Internally, the First Minister has restored discipline, with her opponents now neutralised. Some of these joined Alba, another source of potential headaches extinguished, having failed to make an electoral breakthrough. The Greens, with their eight MSPs combine to form a pro-independence majority with a clear mandate for a referendum.:Iain Macwhirter: It was an SNP landslide, but dont expect an early IndyrefIt is therefore unsurprising that the post-election coverage and analysis has focussed on what this means for the Union and in particular about the possibility of a new vote on independence. It is notable that SNP representatives feel quite at home with this discussion. Since they have already set in place the frame that there will be no referendum until the Covid crisis passes, they have time. But they also have the added bonus of being able to play out ndash after all, lots of it is pantomime ndash the rhetorical battle that pitches the sovereignty of the Scottish people against an ailing Westminster establishment.Read more: Scotland needs vision ndash not business as usual ndash to recover from pandemicWe are far away from a referendum in reality ndash and not just because waiting until the passing of the Covid crisis feels similar to waiting until the ldquofog of Brexit clears. But because the wrangling over the terms of a referendum could be a drawn-out process. Evenone is eventually accepted, we could be looking at changes to the question, demands for a threshold majority to be met, or for the outcome of negotiations after a referendum, should it be successful, to be tied to a confirmatory vote.All of these are important issues that the independence movement must debate and be attuned to. But it would be a profound mistake to focus on these mechanics at the expense of building a popular and coherent vision for Scotland as an independent nation.Kate Forbes speaks as she retains her seat of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituencyTo be blunt, beyond the soundbites, the SNP leadership does not have this in place. The ease and flow of the answers around Scotlandrsquos right to decide are not on display when questions are asked about economic strategy, borders, currency, or the dficulties of re-joining the European Union. Indeed, the current approach seems to defer these challenges: ldquoWe will set out our plans in due course.That is not convincing, but it is perhaps understandable as the outdated Growth Commission lingers around somewhat awkwardly. At a time when state intervention in the economy is seen as a requirement to rebuild from the pandemic, even by erstwhile neoliberals, the SNP is armed with a document that could have been written in the mid-s.When SNP Finance Secretary Kate Forbes was asked about currency during the election, she repeated the now infamous line that Scotland would move to a new currency only after a period of Sterlingisation in which six tests would have to be met. Not only would these tests be near-impossible to meet, even the most generous estimate involves a period of at least  years without a central bank.:English Tory triumph means that independence is our last refuge, by Kevin McKennaYet the architect of this policy, Andrew Wilson, said in an interview after the election that Scotland required the ldquofirepower of an independent country to recover from the pandemic. It just doesnrsquot tally. Without a central bank, borrowing would be set at a premium and quantitative easing made impossible. If the argument is that political independence is required to build Scotland anew, free from the shackles of Tory rule at Westminster, then it follows that economic sovereignty is not an optional extra, but a fundamental necessity.This is not an era for resuscitating fading orthodoxies, though some are desperate to cling to them. The poverty and inequality that has been so exposed during the last year demands an alternative. As we move forward we need an economic and social renewal that only a democratic revolution can bring about. In this sense, independence is either an insurgency against a failed system, or it is merely a nationalist flag -hanging exercise.Read more: Scotland must have the full powers of independence to deal with the economic legacy of CovidThe last referendum was not some dry, constitutional debate. It was a rebellion against austerity, the betrayals of New Labour and a conductor for deeply-felt resentment at political institutions that might as well have been built on a dferent planet. This political awakening shook the halls of power ndash and demanded a better society. The yearning for a new referendum among independence supporters is not just motivated by winning independence, but re-animating that spirit.While  cannot be repeated, nor can a referendum or, indeed, independence be won without the energy that drove that movement. It cannot be left to politicians to do the negotiating behind closed doors. It cannot be left to corporate lobby groups to design economic plans that prioritise the interests of City and the Scottish establishment.The SNP is in a strong position. But that demands action. No more obfuscation ndash but a galvanising plan to move forward. The negotiations for a referendum should start in earnest in order that a vote can be delivered in the first half of this parliament. The Growth Commission must be scrapped ndash urgently ndash so that a transformational prospectus which includes economic control can be developed.It is time to reinvigorate the debate about what the future of Scotland should look like ndash and to do so outside the boardrooms, the television studios and, potentially, the courts. As much as the discussion of how a referendum is brought about dominates, we need also to inject a vision of why independence is desirable in the first place.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The perception that one is either pro this side and anti the other unfortunately goes with the territory irrespective of whether itrsquos accurate.Working as a correspondent, I can think of few other international political issues that so quickly stir emotions or generate partisan responses and acrimony the way this bitter struggle does. Once again this is the case, as the region slips into another cycle of violence, that has spread from east Jerusalem to Gaza these past few days. DAVID PRATT:Just how do we fix an unholy mess like Jerusalem Already the familiar tit-for tat accusations over responsibility for the escalation fly around with all the ferocity, force and political abandon as the stones, rockets and bombs that maim and kill those on both sides.For those perhaps unfamiliar with the complexities of how we got here again or are confused because of too much heat and not enough light being cast on current events, a good place to start is with an observation made a few days ago by Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli attorney specialising in Israeli-Palestinian relations.ldquoThere are two issues which cut to the core of the identity of both the Jewish people and the Palestinian people: displacement and Jerusalem, observed Mr Seidemann, speaking to The Washington Post this weekldquoItrsquos all there in this limited space of Sheikh Jarrah, and once you put them together, itrsquos nuclear fusion, added Mr Seidemann, who is also founder of Terrestrial Jerusalem, an NGO that works towards resolving the competing claims to sovereignty over the city.Police arrest protesters in east JerusalemThe neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah that Mr Seidemann refers to is one that sits in Palestinian east Jerusalem. Itrsquos there that for some time now dozens of Palestinians and their families, despite living there for generations, have been facing eviction in what they say is a move by the Israeli authorities to displace them with the wider aim of turning Sheikh Jarrah into a Jewish settlement.The situation in Sheikh Jarrah is far from unique. The nearby Palestinian east Jerusalem neighbourhood of Silwan is another area in which expanding Jewish settlements has led to increasing friction and there are many others too.Whatrsquos vital to remember here is that both these neighbourhoods, like all east Jerusalem, are considered Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory by much of the international community.Most nations simply donrsquot recognise and indeed many condemn Israelrsquos annexation of east Jerusalem, as a breach of international law.It was back  that Israel passed a law allowing Jews to reclaim property they had lost in or before , the year of Israels creation. DAVID PRATT:Europe is once again facing threat from the far rightIn cases where former east Jerusalem Jewish landowners or their heirs were unavailable, Israel granted administration of the land rights to a government entity called the General Custodian.Since then, according to Israeli anti-occupation groups and highlighted in a France  news report late last year, there have been allegations that the General Custodian has links to well-funded settler organisation Ateret Cohanim which states its mission is making, ldquoJewish le flourish in Jerusalem. This also includes the Muslin quarter of east Jerusalemrsquos Old City and its Palestinian neighbourhoods.For its part, Ateret Cohanim refutes claims that it is working to force out Palestinians, but like many settler organisations it doesnrsquot deny it receives massive donor funding, notably from the US. But while these American pro-settler organisations are the biggest donors, they are far from being the only cash source.Last year an investigation by the BBCrsquos Panorama programme pointed toward companies owned or controlled by the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich who was granted Israeli citizenship in .According to leaked documents used in the investigation, such companies contributed more than m to Elad, a group that supports Israeli settlements in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan.:David Pratt: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and the innocent victims of Irans hostage diplomacyMany human rights organisations have long pointed to funding by such international donors, as providing the means to spearhead the settlersrsquo land grabs. This despite an assurance to the contrary from Ateret Cohanimrsquos executive director Daniel Luria, that ldquowersquore only doing ideological real estate.Whatrsquos beyond doubt is that such financial backing, irrespective of where it comes, only further strengthens the settler movement and its allied political parties who have also become increasingly emboldened because of the rise in Israel ultranationalism.It was from the ranks of these very right-wing parties that many came and took to the streets recently to confront Palestinians to push home their message that all of Jerusalem belongs to Israel.The political groundwork for this scenario is nothing new, laid down as it was back in, when the Israeli parliament passed a law declaring the ldquocomplete and united city of Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel, including the eastern half that it captured in .In other words, it was only matter of time before the contest over east Jerusalem came to the fiery head that it now has.Inevitably, the most pressing question now is just where this latest violence might lead. Is it the beginning of another Palestinians intada or uprising If so, most observers agree that it will be hard for the Palestinian leadership to control a younger generation that they have repeatedly let down.The Palestinian street is a very dferent place today than that I covered during the intadas of  and  and Israel too is an even more politically charged and hardened entity.Meanwhile, much of the wider Arab world equally found wanting for so long in assisting the Palestinians, now appears preoccupied with lsquonormalising relationsrsquo with Israel because of big money trade deals.Which leaves us with the US Biden administration and European Union . Here again as history has shown, donrsquot hold your breath for positive diplomatic intervention from either.

In the case of the  indyref, for example, the Yes campaign promised us a currency union with rUK and automatic EU membership. Neither of these was deliverable unilaterally, or probably at all. The final terms of leaving the UK would have been as dferent to those of the White Paper as the pledges of Michael Gove and Boris Johnson were to the final Brexit terms.The same will apply in indyref ndash for example, the issues of currency, share of debt, EU membership, borders and customs and arrangements will not be in the gt of the Scottish Government. There is therefore a cast-iron case to offer voters a confirmatory vote when the outcome of new independence negotiations are concluded. My recollection is that Nicola Sturgeon campaigned vigorously for such an arrangement regarding Brexit. She should be promising the same ndash and safeguards against a catastrophic victory for the minority ndash right now.What is she scared of Peter A Russell, Glasgow.ITS TIME TO LANCE THE BOILAS a unionist I find myself agreeing with Mark Eadies view that an independence vote must go ahead . The thought of another five years of listening to the whingeing and whining of the SNP while the day job gets ignored will do Scotland nothing but further harm.I believe we have reached the point where the boil that is the constitution issue must be lanced, and the sooner the better.Ive never been fully convinced that Nicola Sturgeon actually wants another referendum. She is reliant on unionist resistance to having one and while that situation remains so does her power base. She knows that to lose would be the end of the matter and probably the SNP.I now believe there is a growing number of unionists who take a similar view to my own as we cannot go on as we are now.There are so many unanswered issues that the SNP hierarchy chooses to sidestep, however these would have to be debated once the gun is fired for a referendum.Here are just a few: currency, fiscal matters, jobs, borders, tax, not forgetting the cost of separation. They were quick to tell us the number of job losses for Brexit, but Ive never heard them say what the figure would be for leaving the UK. No point in scaring the horses.I think when the Scottish electorate learn what awaits them they will not choose austerity on stilts that will last years. The zealots will not care but the majority will.Roy B Hudson, Bearsden.PUT DEVO MAX ON THE BALLOTTHOSE with long memories and an internationalist outlook may be feeling a sense of whats called deja vu in Quebec. The Quebecois community organised two referenda: the first in , which led to a   majority against independence for Quebec. The second referendum in  was extremely close, less than a percentage point separating the two camps. Can we learn from their precedent  Both Quebec and Scotland claimed high-profile sympathisers for independence: de Gaulle for Quebec, and Sean Connery for Scotland.Returning to Scotlands own independence referendum in : as I recall, polls showed a majority in favour of devo max: that meant increased powers for the Holyrood parliament. Gordon Brown was called into action, giving a rousing speech promising additional powers for Holyrood within the current Union. We all know what ensued: David Cameron weaselled out of any such pledge, offering English votes for English laws instead. Then came Brexit ndash another Cameron fiasco, and fresh cause for Scottish discontent.As we have observed, Brexit has been an untidy business, especially in Northern Ireland. Last weeks poll results indicate a Tory \"border wall\" of EU Remainers and Leavers either side of Berwick. If an EU Customs border for goods were relocated to the A and M in place of the Irish Sea, that would allow Scots to enjoy both EU and UK benefits ndash having our cake and eating it.There is no legal requirement for a referendum poll to be binary and isive: why not offer a third, devo max option  Scotlandsto the EU customs union, with reinstatement of ferry links from Rosyth to Belgium or the Netherlands, would benefit trade.Graeme Orr, Neilston.THE UNION IS A LOST CAUSETHE man who gave us the vow in  , the man who broke the Vow, can he be trusted  Of course I speak of Gordon Brown, now calling for a four nations approach to saving the Union . Did he miss something  Surely he did not miss the Holyrood election results, where a clear message came forth Mr Brown and other unionists take note, the people of Scotland have spoken and will no longer be pulled into your web of deceit. The majority from those elected to serve were elected on manestos clearly backing indyref and the time will come for that manesto pledge to be delivered meantime it is the global pandemic that must take priority, as the First Minister has said all along. My advice to Mr Brown: ert your energy to saving the Labour Party from oblivion here in Scotland, because your new venture in saving the Union is a lost cause.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.THE GREENS CONVERSIONI NOTE a fascinating letter by David Webstersuggesting the Greens should park independence as its blanking out their other policies. My recollection is that independence didnt feature much at all with the Greens until  when overnight they found themselves in the position of kingmakers, able to prop up the minority SNP Government in exchange for their demands being met. Possibly a small gain for the environment, but for sure a big loss to democracy.Scott Macintosh, Killearn.* MARK Smithis entirely correct. As one of the . per cent who didnrsquot back the SNP or Greens I am definitely not chuffed by the talk of ldquothe will of the people\". On a % turnout the percentage of the total electorate who voted for the SNPis more like %. Nicola Sturgeon should perhaps rephrase her comments to ldquothe will of some of the people of Scotland.Alan Shepherd, Forfar.* I NOTE that the unionist parties are playing the system in the same way as Alba. Instead of standing as one unionist bloc, they have split themselves into three, thereby gaining more list seats. #gamingthesystem!Ken MacVicar, Lesmahagow.DEMOCRACY SHOULD BEGIN AT HOMETHE State Opening of Parliament was naturally a somewhat scaled-down event, but although smartly dressed in her coat and hat, Her Majesty must have felt like a poor relation next to the gorgeously-clothed Lords in their scarlet and ermine. Of course, all  Lords and Ladies could not be there, but there was enough of them on show to remind us that the House of Lords is the only upper house of any bicameral parliament in the world to be larger than its lower house, and that not one of those peers has been elected by anyone.I note that in the Queens Speech there was a pledge to support democracy around the world given the result of last weeks Scottish Parliament elections, it is to be hoped that the man who wrote the speech will bear in mind that democracy should begin at home.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: If you dont want indie, why not be brave enough to hold a vote against it "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12596257.jpg?type=article-full","title":"rosemary-goring-trials-tribulations-living-bob-dylan-addict","story":"The joint, called Caffe Vivaldi, was dimly lit, and apart from us the meagre clientele were all young. Spread between tables, their conversation was strangely subdued. Rather than chat, people were swivelled towards a student playing a grand piano and singing in a nasal twang. Scarcely daring to speak, we slowly realised that everyone  in the room was waiting their chance to perform. After thin applause greeted the first singer, the next took his turn. Wearing a shiny black stove-pipe hat and with a mouth organ around his neck, he was trying to embody a youthful Bob Dylan.One by one they stepped onto the stage. This was only a few years after  , and yet it might have been Woodstock. Almost to a man ndash and one woman ndash these musicians were living in hope of becoming the next Dylan. Needless to say, we found it riveting. The singers, for their part, would glance our way as their session ended, possibly hoping we were talent scouts.This was in Greenwich Village, where friends had lent us their bijou apartment on West th Street for a holiday. The address meant nothing to me, but when we arrived, walking down the middle of the street between banks of ploughed snow, I learned that we were following directly in Dylanrsquos footsteps.

Muslim pilgrims do the Hajj, Christians walk the Camino de Santiago and, as I was soon to discover, Dylan fanatics prowl Bleecker Street, MacDougal Street and Washington Square, catching at the coat-tails of their hero.

Not that the latest long-form ballad, Murder Most Foul ndash  minutes ndash about JFKrsquos assassination, is much good for audience participation. When the gentle plop on the doormat announced its arrival at the height of lockdown, it was conveyed to the CD player with more reverence than a midwe bearing a newborn. It was listened to, and then dissected, with the attention clerics devote to a holy book. Indeed Bobsters, like Bible-bashers, can find a quote to fit any occasion.And the choice of lyrics continues to grow. Thatrsquos the thing about living with Dylan. One version of his songs is not enough. You need it acoustic, electric, accompanied by The Band, or solo with just the bard and his guitar and moothie. There are Basement tapes, the Bootleg Series, and fathomless dodgy recordings from the never-ending tours. Even when I think wersquove heard every conceivable configuration, there are compilations by other singers covering his work, not always in English.

Camera palsy appears to be a frequent affliction in the presence of an idol. But even when he is in sharp focus, Dylan mumbles so softly he seems worried hersquoll waken the audience.

For a man of mystery, almost every minute he has spent in public appears to have found its way into the archive.When his memoir Chronicles was published, yoursquod have thought Proustrsquos heir had been found.

But thatrsquos exactly what Britain did in its imperial glory days, and traces of that remain. One aspect of that policy was the renaming of places and people to make them sound more British. The most famous example is probably Nelson Mandela, who became Nelson only after he was given that fine British name on his first day at school.In his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela remarks in the first paragraph that his given first name is Rolihlahla, which in Xhosa has a colloquial meaning of ldquotroublemaker.

The anglicised name of Auchinleck is derived from the Gaelic Achadh nan Leacand a scan of any ancient map will show numerous place names all over Scotland starting with Auch from the Gaelic achadh . In the th century mostnot all of Scotland spoke Gaelic, to be replaced over time with Scots, Lallans and others.The Daily Review of  published a letter by D. Murray-Lyon of Ayr of which the following is a short extract: ldquoGaelic was to some extent spoken in Ayrshire in the early part of shellip. Margaret McMurray who died at a very advanced age about the year , was long talked about as being the last Gaelic-speaking native of Carrick.By way of supporting her case, Ms Judge says Robert Burns would have written his poems in Gaelic, but it had long died out in Ayrshire by Burnsrsquos time and also ignores the dficulty of doing so in these troubled times. Westminster introduced the Act of Proscription of  which applied to \"that part of Great Briton called Scotland and included among a long list of other things, a ban on all forms of Highland clothes under penalty of imprisonment for a first offence and transportation to one of His Majestyrsquos plantations for seven years for a second offence. Although Gaelic was not banned as such, parents could only send their children to schools registered under the above act where Gaelic was not taught, was discouraged and those who spoke it were frequently punished with the tawse. As a government exciseman, any attempt by Burns to compose his poetry in Gaelic would have faced severe retribution.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.* CELIA Judge is mistaken. During the th and th centuries Gaelic was spoken throughout mainland Scotland.

It didnrsquot even rain. Alba failed to register even % in the election ndash yet because of defections it has representatives in the House of Commons and Scottish councils.The two MPs are Kenny MacAskill and Neale Hanvey. The case around Hanvey is a little more complicated than MacAskill, whorsquos a straightforward defector from the SNP to Alba.In , Hanvey was the SNPrsquos candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. He was dropped in November over using anti-semitic language on social media. Despite his suspension, Hanvey appeared on the ballot next to the SNP name as the deadline for candidates to be nominated had passed.After election, he initially sat as an independent. He apologised for anti-semitic language and was readmitted to the SNP. In , he was appointed the SNPrsquos spokesperson for the Westminster Health and Social Care Select Committee. This March, Hanvey, together with Kenny MacAskill who was elected as the SNP MP for East Lothian, and a number of SNP councillors, defected to Alba. NEIL MACKAY: The Alba effectClearly, voters represented by Hanvey, MacAskill and others ndash such as the Inverclyde councillor Christopher McEleny ndash didnrsquot vote for them as members of Alba. So surely, the only honourable course of action is for these defectors to stand down immediately and submit themselves to by-elections. If the people they currently represent still find them suitable as representatives, then all well and good. However, to cling on to position, power and a public pay cheque in the current circumstances is surely morally untenable, even cowardly.This week Neale Hanvey denounced the SNP as toxic, aggressive and hostile, saying he ldquodetested what the party had become. It would evidently be best policy, perhaps, for all concernedhe makes a clear and irrevocable split with the SNP, putting himself up for re-election on an Alba ticket so he cannot be accused of riding into a job on the coattails of a party he evidently loathes.On a wider stage, matters are currently going very badly for prominent Alba supporters. Craig Murray, a former British diplomat who became a blogger and cheerleader for Alex Salmond, was sentenced to eight months in prison this week for contempt of court relating to the trial of the former First Minister. Judges ruled Murray in contempt relating to material capable of identying four complainers in the case.The future looks shaky too for the nationalist marching organisation All Under One Banner. One of its key figures, Neil MacKay , made great play on social media of showing support for the Alba Party, attracting ridicule and rage from mainstream Yes voters. Some people who previously took part in the rallies have sworn never to attend again, seeing the organisation tainted by Alba support.Itrsquos also a rather embarrassing time for whatrsquos been termed the lsquoalt-nat blogospherersquo which rallied to Salmondrsquos party. Their role was seen as a major turn-off factor when it came to Alba, with ordinary voters repelled by a toxic mix of conspiracy theories, hate and bigotry.Therersquos speculation that Salmond could have done somewhat better at the polls ndash despite his own low approval ratings ndashhersquod wisely kept clear of such characters.Kenny MacAskillThese online voices are really left with nowhere to go now, but further down the rabbit holes theyrsquove been digging for themselves and their diminishing bands of followers for years. They imagined Nicola Sturgeon ousted from office in the wake of the Salmond inquiries and Alba holding seats in Holyrood. Theyrsquove been repeatedly proved wrong.The more tricky question regarding the aftermath of Alba is what Sturgeon should do about those thorns in her side, and the side of the SNP, who many suspected of planning to jump ship to Alba, but when the crunch came seemingly lacked the courage to defect.Although it was all rumour and zero proof, there was intense speculation MPs Angus MacNeil and Joanna Cherry would defect. Both dismissed the idea.However, previous interventions by Cherry and MacNeil have made le dficult for the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon. Both are seen as having undermined Sturgeonrsquos leadership, and ndash whether they like it or not ndash perceived as central to the long-running civil war within the ranks of the SNP which caused considerable damage to the party.Whatrsquos clear now, though, is that with the defeat of Alba and its rejection by the electorate, Sturgeon is in a strong position to crack down on any dissent in the ranks. It might well become a rather tough season for the SNPrsquos erstwhile awkward squad.There were recent reports that Alex Salmond claimed he could have lsquodestroyedrsquo Nicola Sturgeon. The only thing which has been destroyed is Albarsquos hopes of gaining any traction with the Scottish people. Salmond, however, insists that his party will ldquobloom. The former First Minister is entitled to think what he wishes, but his hopes seem unlikely to be fulfilled. NEIL MACKAY: Salmonds Trumpian circusSalmond is on much firmer ground with his recent warning that ldquoonline warriors are a problem in modern politics. Hersquos undoubtedly correct. So it was a little discomfiting to see him in a online discussion say ndash in jest, it appeared ndash that ldquoone day Irsquom going to unleash myself on Twitter now that Donald Trump has created a vacuum for me.Salmond still casts a long shadow. The husband of one of the women in the Salmond case recently said that the former First Ministerrsquosto the political spotlight had left his we ldquoincapacitated by depression. We must remember Salmond was cleared of all charges.Salmond could change a lothe took just a few simple steps. Apologise for his past behaviour as Nicola Sturgeon has advised him to do, and distance himself from the coterie of extremist voices which surround him. He could also advise the defectors from the SNP to Alba to show the courage of their convictions and face by-election.

They would be as foolish indefinitely to rule out any repeat referendum as the SNP would be to rush into it. Politicians who say there cannot be another shot at independence for half a century are as likely to be punished by the voters as politicians who say it must all happen by the end of the autumn.

Even the most enthusiastic Yes voters understand that we have to recover from Covid first.But, evennow is not the time, it does not follow that all the UK Government should do is to sit back and hope that the clock does not tick too fast.There are those who counsel that unionists should just stop talking about it. Let the SNP talk about itthey want to ndash its their project, after all. We unionists, on the other hand, should get on with fixing the backlog in the NHS, with addressing the year of lost schooling, and with the rising tide of unemployment that, one fears, has been delayed rather than reversed by the Treasuryrsquos highly successful furlough scheme.I hear the force of that argument, but I take a dferent view. I think governments can do more than one thing at a time. Our focus should be on the recovery but, at the same time, we do need to start having a more serious conversation about independence than we have had until now.

Whilst these arenrsquot the same bacteria that infect humans, and the risk of cross-over of AMR from salmon to humans is therefore low, Scotlandrsquos farmers are keen to play their part in the global response.ldquoScottish salmon farming generally has a very low use of antibiotics compared with other livestock sectors and Scottish Sea Farms has consistently had antibiotic usage well below the sectorrsquos target.The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, which represents % of Scotlandrsquos salmon farmers, is a member of RUMAan independent non-profit group that promotes and monitors best practice and the responsible use of animal medicine from ldquofarm to fork.The alliance is uniquely important as it allows all UK animal farming sectors to support each other with the overall aim of improving animal welfare.Working with RUMA, the Scottish salmon sector has committed itself to an ambitious and low antibiotic use target of mg of antibiotic active substance per kg of salmon produced.In the four years between  and  inclusive, Scottish Sea Farms averaged . mg kg but in  this dropped to . mg kg , with no antibiotic usage at all in .Soutar attributes this sector-leading success to a combination of ongoing improvements in fish husbandry practices and investment in a new pound million biosecure hatchery.ldquoOur use of antibiotics in the freshwater phase of production has been because infections can occur before fish are big enough to be vaccinated, explained Soutar.ldquoHowever, new husbandry protocols and major investment in biosecure facilities are making such infections increasingly rare.ldquoOut on our marine farms, meanwhile, fish health strategies such as reducing handling and stress, reacting quickly when environmental conditions change, and the timely removal of any ailing fish, are all helping reduce the risk of sea-borne infections.This lsquoprevention over curersquo approach to fish health and welfare is very much a holistic one, with the companyrsquos vets involved at every stage of the farming cycle, from salmon egg through to humane harvesting.Not only has it helped drive down antibiotic use to zero in  but it has also contributed to the salmon grower achieving an average fish survival rate of  per cent over the same  months.ldquoBut there is no room for complacency, cautioned Soutar. ldquoThere is an element of luck because there is always a possibility, whether yoursquore farming plants or animals, of emerging diseases that appear and cause problems.ldquoWe will consider antibiotic use , in specic circumstances, veterinary advice is that it is essential for the protection of fish welfare.ldquoThe important thing is to keep applying the lessons learned from dealing with other bacterial diseases in the past to any new threats ndash that and developing more and better vaccines to further reduce the need for antibiotics.ldquoWhile there are a number of promising new developments in therapies other than antibiotics, the last year has really confirmed our long-held belief that vaccines are the answer.Commenting on Scottish Sea Farmsrsquo achievement, Dr Iain Berrill, Head of Technical at the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, said: lsquoRaising fish in the natural environment can lead to challenging and unpredictable biological conditions, yet antibiotic use remains very low across the Scottish salmon sector.ldquoThis is in part thanks to the use of vaccines for all our fish combined with good husbandry techniques as outlined in the sectorrsquos Code of Good Practice.ldquoScotland is already world-leading when it comes to reporting of survival data and management of sea lice, which is something we can all be proud of. Our sector will continue to invest in fish health and welfare because it is at the heart of everything we do in the Scottish salmon sector.ldquoNew techniques, technology and research continue to assist our experienced vets and fish health professionals in caring for our salmon responsibly.ldquoWe congratulate Scottish Sea Farms on their progress and look forward to further fish health milestones being reachedthroughout the sector in the future.----------------------------------------------Leading seafood firm shores up welfare standards with new poundm feeding centreFARMED fish are living beings, so looking after them well is the right thing to do. However, protecting their health can bring substantial economic benefits too, as many companies in the sector will testy.Among them is Grieg Seafood Shetland. With  salmon farms, a hatchery, a harvesting plant and more than  employees, it is one of the biggest businesses in the Northern Isles.Staff at Grieg Seafood Shetlandrsquos feeding operations centre use the latest technology to ensure good health in fish stocksThe companyrsquos commitment to high standards of fish welfare was demonstrated earlier this year when it opened a pound million, state-of-the-art centralised feeding centre in Lerwick.This will improve monitoring of the fish and their nutrition as well as reducing feed waste.ldquoIn essence, we are the same as any other farmer, says Managing Director Grant Cumming. ldquoWe make money by selling a product andthe salmon donrsquot grow well and prosper, then we obviously donrsquot have a product to sell.ldquoHowever, we also have to consider the moral and ethical dimension. We have a duty of care over the salmon ndash to look after them and protect them. Then therersquos the environmental aspect.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be wasting the finite resources of the planet.The salmon have to be carefully and properly fed, he says, but this is more complex than with onshore farmed livestock as they are underwater.ldquoWe used to feed them from the surface and tried to judgethey had received enough, but their pens could be  metres down or even deeper,you were lucky on a nice day you might see whatrsquos happening in the top five metres.ldquoThat meant we were largely guessing, which wasnrsquot a good thing for fish health. If we didnrsquot feed them enough, they didnrsquot grow properly, butwe fed them too much, that would waste feed that could potentially cause pollution and would certainly cause us a loss of income.To solve this problem, the farm moved to using underwater cameras.ldquoThat meant we were feeding looking up, rather than down, and that helped a lot says Cumming.However, the disadvantage of this was that the monitoring had to be done from a barge that could rock about at sea.The next step was to move the monitoring to a number of portacabins spread across Shetland, but spreading the exercise across dferent locations wasnrsquot ideal either.The new centralised base is in the main town of Lerwick, with connections to the farms made via fibre optic cable. ldquoItrsquos a much nicer facility to be in, Cumming explains.ldquoIt also allows the whole team to be together in one place.ldquoThat means therersquos a better exchange of ideas ndash the team can talk to and mentor each other, give advice and figure out the best methods of working.ldquoInstead of picking up a phone to talk to each other, people can literally just walk from desk to desk.Irene Walden is the Feeding Operations Manager at the new centre. ldquoIt makes it much easier for me to oversee things,she says.ldquoWe can now feed the fish better and create greater efficiencies.ldquoIt also gives us greater flexibility as it means we can feed through slacker tides when we need to ndash strong currents may not be good for feeding the fish.ldquoSome salmon also actually prefer being fed at dferent times to others and the technology we have now allows us to do that.Plus being together allows us to share best practice.Cumming says they are still in the early days of using the centre, but it is already paying idends.ldquoThe fish are feeding more and they have a better appetite than we would have expected. We expect to see a relatively quickon investment ndash wersquorevery pleased.-----------------------------------------ERADICATING ANTIBIOTICSKEY elements of Scottish Sea Farmsrsquo strategy to eliminate antibiotic use include:"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : amA problem is currently affecting the council#s phone system, an Orkney Islands Councilspokesman has confirmed.

They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3799783.jpg--.jpg?1620807562000\n","title":"canoe crews help clean up banks of the braid","story":"County Antrim Paddle Sportare asking the public ‘canoe help’ to clean up local river banks After a recent litter pick along the Braid River they managed to lt  refuse bags of general litter, three tyres, a plastic oil drum and piping, a bucket, and even a part of a low rider bike!

Credit: Brian LawlessSenan MolonyMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Taoiseach has appealed to Northern Ireland to join the Republic in introducing minimum unit pricingfor alcohol.Micheal Martin’s plea came after an Irish government backbencher told him that making lower-market alcohol more expensive from next January would lead to “droves” heading across the border to bulk-buy.“This legislation is right, but at the wrong time. If it is to be successful, it has to be introduced at the same time on both sides ,” said Fine Gael’s Louth TD Peter Fitzpatrick.“We’re seven months out from the introduction of MUP next January, and I would appeal to the Northern Ireland Executive, to all political parties in the North, and to anyone with influence on the parties, to support a measure like this within Northern Ireland so that we would have complete alignment.”There were previous discussions between the two departments of health, he said, “and the indications were from the Executive were that they were not looking at this at all until ”.In contrast, there has been all-party agreement in the Dail as far back as .Mr Martin said the obvious reason for the move was that the below-cost selling of alcohol was harming children and young people in particular.“Some of the figures are quite horrendous. Ireland has the highest level, for example, of adolescent binge-drinking in the world, at % for females and .% for males, according to a global study on adolescent health published in The Lancet in March ,” he said.“The cost of alcohol-related discharges from hospital in  was €.bn. The estimated cost of alcohol-related absenteeism from work was €m in . One in seven workers suffered problems due to others’ drinking in , including one in  workers who reported having to work extra hours due to co-workers’ drinking.“It’s estimated now that the number of hospitalisations wholly attributed to alcohol has risen by % between  and , going up from , to ,.”From  to  there were , alcohol-related deaths.

I will be voting on Friday. I won#t be saying who I#m voting for because I think that would be incredibly unfair, she said.Mrs Foster was speaking as Sir Jeffrey vowed to “vigorously oppose the protocol both in principle and practice” and warned that he would “take further steps” that will impact on North-South relations.In a nine-page manesto sent to DUP MLAs and MPs, and seen by the Belfast , he takes a side swipe at his leadership rival Mr Poots with a reference that there must be no more “mixed messaging” on resisting the protocol.Despite his opposition to the Irish Sea border, the Agriculture Minister’s officials were heavily involved in building its infrastructure.Sir Jeffrey says: “Under my leadership, we will continue to vigorously oppose the protocol, both in principle and in practice. There cannot be mixed messaging on this.”The Lagan Valley MP describes the protocol as “the gravest challenge facing unionism”, and says it has “fundamentally changed Northern Ireland’s place within the UK”.He defends his own Westminster record on Brexit: “The DUP consistently opposed the economic and constitutional separation of Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK in all its manestations whether it was Theresa May’s backstop or Boris Johnson’s protocol.“Indeed, as chief whip, I was able to ensure that we used our votes and our position to stop the government inflicting it upon Northern Ireland.“It was only when the Prime Minister was forced to call an election that he secured a majority and ensured his Brexit deal passed.However, it remains completely unacceptable. The protocol is detrimental not only to our prosperity but also to peace and stability.”Sir Jeffrey calls on the government to “live up to the promises it made to the people of Northern Ireland and replace the protocol”.He adds: “As a party, we will continue our joint legal action against the protocol and revisit our five-point plan to take further steps that demonstrate it cannot be business as usual, including on North-South relations.“We call on the Prime Minister to convene a summit on internal UK trade that will identy solutions required to ensure unfettered trade across the UK.”Despite the Irish Sea border, Sir Jeffrey remains optimistic about the Union. In Northern Ireland’s centenary year, republicans still have “no plan to achieve their goal” of Irish unity. In next May’s Assembly election, he says the DUP “must set out a positive vision” for the next century.Future generations must have “more educational, economic, social and cultural opportunities than ever before” through “a system of competent government” at Stormont.In his policy document, Sir Jeffrey proposes the creation of a “Coalition for the Union” involving England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Like Mr Poots, he supports a unionist convention. It would offer “an opportunity to build practical and strategic unity” but it must deliver “actions not words”. He hopes that it would lead to the setting up of a “new pro-Union campaigning group”.The Lagan Valley MP also calls for an “annual UK-wide conference on the Union” to bring together people from across civic and political society, business and academia, to “encourage thinking and promotion of pro-Union ideas, research and relationships”.In the manesto entitled ‘A Vision For The Union’, Sir Jeffrey says that he believes in a strong, strategic and inspiring plan to strengthen unionism..It is understood that in meetings with MLAs, he has pledged that they will be given a “major say” in choosing the next First Minister and the party’s entire ministerial team at Stormonthe is elected leader.The DUP electoral college of  MLAs and eight MPs will chose Sir Jeffrey or Mr Poots as their new leader tomorrow. The result is expected to be known around pm.Meanwhile, Mr Poots has faced criticism for stopping another north-south ministerial meeting from taking place. The DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council  meetings due to its opposition to the protocol.Yesterday’s meeting was billed as long-standing” on in relation to agriculture. SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon tweeted thatthe Agriculture Minister’s absence  was “a sign of things to come, it doesn’t bode well”. She added: Power-sharing requires leadership.”Meanwhile, the Prime Minister yesterday held an online meeting with Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill. Afterwards, the First Minister said: “We received a briefing on Lord Frost’s plans to deal with the flawed Northern Ireland protocol.Lord Frost was part of the call. It is clear the Protocol needs replaced to restore the free flow of goods from GB-NI. The protocol is damaging both economically and constitutionally therefore whilst statements from the government are welcome, we really need to see meaningful action.”Earlier, Mrs Foster and Ms O#Neill visited Clandeboye Golf Club in Bangor to congratulate officials on securing the PGA EuroPro Northern Ireland Masters Golf TournamentBelfast Most ReadBody of Northern Ireland woman Suzanne Knowles missing in Spain is foundDUP’s Donaldson takes swipe at Poots vowing to ‘vigorously oppose’ NI protocol and further disrupt North-South relationsArmagh newlyweds’ parents ordered to remove marquee ahead of Dublin wedding receptionFirm behind Belfast’s Wellington Park Hotel is liquidatedBallymurphy massacre relatives urge Boris Johnson to say sorry in public rejecting his ‘third-party’ apologyTop VideosPlayUK Government apology #bare minimum# for Ballymurphy familiesPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayVideo: The baby elephant kept in Belfast backyard duringWorld War II Blitz Latest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland facing unprecedented mental health challenges, Swann warnsNI’s mental health crisis: From kids aged four to the over s, how pleas for help soared in lockdownDUP’s Donaldson slammed for claims he will risk Stormont collapse over protocolNI’s political rivals unite to call for a halt to Israel-Gaza violenceArmagh wedding couple’s Covid-threat reception marquee demolishedLatestAli McCann: Celtic tracking Northern Ireland midfielder after leading displays for St JohnstoneIn pictures: Linfield and Glentoran in derby draw as Kirsty McGuinness sends Cltonville top of Women’s PremiershipTrial date set for man accused of murder of PCSO Julia JamesPasha Kovalev: I am fortunate the pandemic gave me time with my baby daughterPremier League agrees to renew £billion domestic TV rights deal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I know I’m breaching my tenancy but it is my son’s wedding and he has no other place to go.”The council was also given leave to broadcast the court’s orders on national radio stations even as the bride and groom and their guests were on their way from Co Armagh for today’s planned pm reception in Co Dublin.Mr Donovan said the gardaí were supporting the council’s application and when he asked Mr Connors to take the marquee down he replied: “I can’t take it down. My son’s wedding is going ahead and I accept the consequences of not taking it down.”Ms Neary, a solicitor in the legal department of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, said after the injunction application that the council would be moving immediately to take the marquee down or hire an independent contractor to do the work for it.Judge Ní Chulacháin said she noticed from photographs of the marquee taken by Mr Donovan that there were  tables surrounded by chairs in the marquee, enough chairs to accommodate more than  people.Mr Flynn told the court the council considered the planned reception to be a breach of Covid- regulations in the middle of a global pandemic as well as breaking a tenancy agreement. The local authority was also concerned about the lack of insurance cover for this evening’s event.Judge Ní Chulacháin gave the council leave to serve personal notice on Mr Connors and also pin up notices outlining details of the court’s orders. The judge also directed that everyone associated with the reception, including the bridal party and guests, be warned they had been restrained from entering the marquee.Mr Flynn indicated that the council had signicant concerns relating to the use of the marquee for the wedding reception which, he said, unless restrained by the court the Connors planned to go ahead with.Independent.ieMost ReadBody of Northern Ireland woman Suzanne Knowles missing in Spain is foundDUP’s Donaldson takes swipe at Poots vowing to ‘vigorously oppose’ NI protocol and further disrupt North-South relationsArmagh newlyweds’ parents ordered to remove marquee ahead of Dublin wedding receptionFirm behind Belfast’s Wellington Park Hotel is liquidatedBallymurphy massacre relatives urge Boris Johnson to say sorry in public rejecting his ‘third-party’ apologyTop VideosPlayUK Government apology #bare minimum# for Ballymurphy familiesPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayVideo: The baby elephant kept in Belfast backyard duringWorld War II Blitz Latest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland facing unprecedented mental health challenges, Swann warnsNI’s mental health crisis: From kids aged four to the over s, how pleas for help soared in lockdownDUP’s Donaldson slammed for claims he will risk Stormont collapse over protocolNI’s political rivals unite to call for a halt to Israel-Gaza violenceArmagh wedding couple’s Covid-threat reception marquee demolishedLatestAli McCann: Celtic tracking Northern Ireland midfielder after leading displays for St JohnstoneIn pictures: Linfield and Glentoran in derby draw as Kirsty McGuinness sends Cltonville top of Women’s PremiershipIsrael has legitimate right to defend itself, says Foreign Office ministerTrains with cracks toto service after ‘rigorous tests’Northern Ireland facing unprecedented mental health challenges, Swann warns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I got chatting to him and thats how I got involved with Sinn Feacutein in our area. Learning about British influence in Ireland and all the damage that had done, and the hurt and pain that had been caused through the generations as a result, I could see Irish unity as the solution. Thats what I became focused on the reunication of the country and seeing this place recognised as it should be, in my view. googletag.cmd.push  LT: What has been your biggest achievement  ES: I would say the wins for people on the ground. When somebody contacts you about a care package, or a big pothole outside their house which is a safety issue, those are the biggest wins. If someone comes to you with a problem that is causing them anxiety, and you can do something that gets that sorted, the sense of satisfaction is great.  LT: And your biggest challenge  ES: It really winds me up when we get compared to the DUP and characterised as a green version. We are polar opposites in every way. googletag.cmd.push Were a left-wing progressive party, but we get characterised as another version of the DUP, and that easy narrative is completely inaccurate. Were not opposed to the British monarchy because of iniduals within the British royal family, were opposed to it because it sets one group of people above everyone .  LT: You were co-opted in  for Ian Milne. Your first election campaign will be coming up – are you excited or apprehensive  ES: Elections are always an interesting time, there is high pressure, hard work and long days, but Im relishing the opportunity to get out and get chatting to people.     The idea of getting involved in the discussion is one thing, the idea of being up for election itself is obviously daunting. Im there as a member of an incredible team. We have  class councillors in Mid Ulster, so its not like Im going in without support. Emma Sheerin with fellow Mid Ulster MLAs Michelle ONeill and Linda Dillon. LT: As a young woman in politics, have you faced any online abuse from anonymous trolls  ES: I do get troll accounts and faceless people. I remember the night I was selected and people were on social media congratulating me and welcoming me to the MLA team. This one person put up a meme of a wee pig running around with the caption oh great, another pig in a skirt. I cracked up laughing. get more frustrated on social media when its people that I know parroting out something that isnt true than I would be about faceless accounts calling me names.  LT: Youre the Equality Spokesperson for Sinn Feacutein. Did it sit comfortably for you abstaining in the recent vote on the Severe Foetal Impairment Bill in the Assembly  ES: We had a lot of conversations about how to handle that, and the reason we abstained was because the British government had made it very clear that they were going to uphold the law in the North. We knew this bill, whilst making its way through the Assembly, wasnt actually going to affect any material change, because the British government were going to overturn it. The DUP were playing politics. They used sensationalised versions of peoples stories to make political gains and appeal to a certain base. If we were going to start voting for or trying to amend, we would be engaging with them. The people that are affected by this issue have been traumatised enough and we didnt want to see that carry on. The debate has been had, the law has been set in order to be human rights compliant. Its a very sensitive issue and people have very strong feelings on one side or the other.  LT: Youre rooted in South Derry. How dficult is it to balance the constituency work with Stormont business  ES: It can be trying at times, because when Stormont is running at full tilt, its fairly full-on. At the minute, the schedule is cut slightly, but outside of Coronavirus, you could be here til ,, at night. Youre trying to fit in chasing up constituency stuff around that and then on a Friday, youre in the constituency, but youre trying to meet with groups and organisations too.  LT: Until a few weeks ago, three of the main parties had female leaders. Do you think Arlene Foster was unfairly treated by those within her party  ES: Arlene herself, in the cut and thrust of politics, was never a progressive. She was never out there leading from the front, trying to break the glass ceiling for women. I would be fearful of where the DUP are going next, but Arlene didnt vote to ban conversion therapy, she just abstained. On the surface, it looks like Arlene got a raw deal but we didnt see massive steps for progression under her stewardship. Emma Sheerin says Arlene has done little to help the cause of women in politics. LT: Sinn Feacutein have had dficulties in Derry City over the last few weeks. Does it leave a possibility they could concede further ground to the SDLP in Foyle  ES: We would have election reviews in every area and I really dont know how we saw such a big loss in Derry two years ago. We cant worry about what anyone  is doing, we focus on ourselves. We wouldnt like to pre-empt what the results would be in a years time but we hope totwo Sinn Feacutein MLAs in Derry. I know Karen and Martina are hard, hard workers and have been active on the ground. Obviously the results weve had have shown weve had problems and that has led to the decision.  LT: Finally, is there anything youre hoping to achieve in the remainder of this term  ES: Im working on a Private Members Bill at the minute around gender budgeting. Its about identying decision making for the government in the North where they dont factor women in. You end up with these sort of systemic, built-in inequalities from a starting point, so its trying to tackle that at root cause so outcomes are more likely to be equal. The impact of Covid- on women has shown up they are more than likely to carry the burden of domestic responsiblities or caring responsibilities. We want to fix that imbalance  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I got chatting to him and thats how I got involved with Sinn Feacutein in our area. Learning about British influence in Ireland and all the damage that had done, and the hurt and pain that had been caused through the generations as a result, I could see Irish unity as the solution. Thats what I became focused on the reunication of the country and seeing this place recognised as it should be, in my view. googletag.cmd.push  LT: What has been your biggest achievement  ES: I would say the wins for people on the ground. When somebody contacts you about a care package, or a big pothole outside their house which is a safety issue, those are the biggest wins. If someone comes to you with a problem that is causing them anxiety, and you can do something that gets that sorted, the sense of satisfaction is great.  LT: And your biggest challenge  ES: It really winds me up when we get compared to the DUP and characterised as a green version. We are polar opposites in every way. googletag.cmd.push Were a left-wing progressive party, but we get characterised as another version of the DUP, and that easy narrative is completely inaccurate. Were not opposed to the British monarchy because of iniduals within the British royal family, were opposed to it because it sets one group of people above everyone .  LT: You were co-opted in  for Ian Milne. Your first election campaign will be coming up – are you excited or apprehensive  ES: Elections are always an interesting time, there is high pressure, hard work and long days, but Im relishing the opportunity to get out and get chatting to people.     The idea of getting involved in the discussion is one thing, the idea of being up for election itself is obviously daunting. Im there as a member of an incredible team. We have  class councillors in Mid Ulster, so its not like Im going in without support. Emma Sheerin with fellow Mid Ulster MLAs Michelle ONeill and Linda Dillon. LT: As a young woman in politics, have you faced any online abuse from anonymous trolls  ES: I do get troll accounts and faceless people. I remember the night I was selected and people were on social media congratulating me and welcoming me to the MLA team. This one person put up a meme of a wee pig running around with the caption oh great, another pig in a skirt. I cracked up laughing. get more frustrated on social media when its people that I know parroting out something that isnt true than I would be about faceless accounts calling me names.  LT: Youre the Equality Spokesperson for Sinn Feacutein. Did it sit comfortably for you abstaining in the recent vote on the Severe Foetal Impairment Bill in the Assembly  ES: We had a lot of conversations about how to handle that, and the reason we abstained was because the British government had made it very clear that they were going to uphold the law in the North. We knew this bill, whilst making its way through the Assembly, wasnt actually going to affect any material change, because the British government were going to overturn it. The DUP were playing politics. They used sensationalised versions of peoples stories to make political gains and appeal to a certain base. If we were going to start voting for or trying to amend, we would be engaging with them. The people that are affected by this issue have been traumatised enough and we didnt want to see that carry on. The debate has been had, the law has been set in order to be human rights compliant. Its a very sensitive issue and people have very strong feelings on one side or the other.  LT: Youre rooted in South Derry. How dficult is it to balance the constituency work with Stormont business  ES: It can be trying at times, because when Stormont is running at full tilt, its fairly full-on. At the minute, the schedule is cut slightly, but outside of Coronavirus, you could be here til ,, at night. Youre trying to fit in chasing up constituency stuff around that and then on a Friday, youre in the constituency, but youre trying to meet with groups and organisations too.  LT: Until a few weeks ago, three of the main parties had female leaders. Do you think Arlene Foster was unfairly treated by those within her party  ES: Arlene herself, in the cut and thrust of politics, was never a progressive. She was never out there leading from the front, trying to break the glass ceiling for women. I would be fearful of where the DUP are going next, but Arlene didnt vote to ban conversion therapy, she just abstained. On the surface, it looks like Arlene got a raw deal but we didnt see massive steps for progression under her stewardship. Emma Sheerin says Arlene has done little to help the cause of women in politics. LT: Sinn Feacutein have had dficulties in Derry City over the last few weeks. Does it leave a possibility they could concede further ground to the SDLP in Foyle  ES: We would have election reviews in every area and I really dont know how we saw such a big loss in Derry two years ago. We cant worry about what anyone  is doing, we focus on ourselves. We wouldnt like to pre-empt what the results would be in a years time but we hope totwo Sinn Feacutein MLAs in Derry. I know Karen and Martina are hard, hard workers and have been active on the ground. Obviously the results weve had have shown weve had problems and that has led to the decision.  LT: Finally, is there anything youre hoping to achieve in the remainder of this term  ES: Im working on a Private Members Bill at the minute around gender budgeting. Its about identying decision making for the government in the North where they dont factor women in. You end up with these sort of systemic, built-in inequalities from a starting point, so its trying to tackle that at root cause so outcomes are more likely to be equal. The impact of Covid- on women has shown up they are more than likely to carry the burden of domestic responsiblities or caring responsibilities. We want to fix that imbalance  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year more than ever, it is important to celebrate the incredible contributions that nurses make to our society. One such inidual who deserves a special mention is Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist Margaret Carlin who was named Cancer Nurse of the Year  at the Royal College of Nursing Awards NI. Margaret is from Magherafelt and is based at Antrim Area Hospital. She has been caring for local people for almost  years and has just retired from her full-time post. googletag.cmd.push Margaret took up her role as a Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialist in the Mid Ulster Hospital in . “My post was created as a result of collaboration between Macmillan Cancer Support and what is now the Northern Health and Social Care Trust,” recalls Margaret. “It was important to have a full-time nurse specialist who could provide expert advice, support and information to patients who were living with cancer or a le limiting illness.” Following Margaret’s appointment, her sterling work in the community was well known. Funds, however, were needed to continue to support her role and this inspired a group of iniduals in the Magherafelt area to form a fundraising committee. googletag.cmd.push In their time, Magherafelt Fundraising Committee raised over pound,, pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support in Northern Ireland. “Over the years I have met and cared for many people with cancer and other le limiting conditions, often at times of great distress for them, their families and loved ones,” explains Margaret. “They have allowed me into their lives and to be with them throughout their illness. They have shared their thoughts and feelings with me and told me about their hopes and fears for the future. We laughed together and sometimes we cried together. “Throughout the years, I continue to meet people who I met at the time when they were diagnosed with cancer.     “I am always glad to see them and it makes me really happy to see the quality of le they continue to have. I also meet many families whose loved ones I cared for, who sadly have died, and I am always touched that they remember me and the times we spent together. “They tell me about their lives now and changes there have been. “They tell me how their children and grandchildren have grown up and are doing well and this reminds me that I will always be part of their memories and how privileged I am to be a Macmillan nurse.” Margaret initially trained as a nursing student in Mid Ulster Hospital from - and following this worked as a staff nurse in the Mid Ulster Hospital. It was in October  that she became a Macmillan nurse, delivering chemotherapy to patients as well as helping to set up and establish palliative care services. In , Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital as Macmillan Lung Cancer Nurse Specialist. “Since Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital, she has worked tirelessly to raise the standards of the care delivered to patients diagnosed with lung cancer,” explains Sally Convery, Macmillan Service Lead for Palliative Care. “Margaret is passionate about caring for the inidual and is very focused on ensuring patients are recognised as people and not by their diagnosis. “She encourages them to focus on the positive aspects of le and not on their diagnosis. Margaret is an excellent role model to the other lung cancer nurses and demonstrates her passion for ensuring safe and effective care. “She continually strives to improve the patient’s quality of le and has shown outstanding commitment to the creation and delivery of a pulmonary prehabilitation self-management programme for patients with lung cancer. “Margaret believes it is important services are delivered with patients and relatives at the forefront and because of this she is involved in and promotes ious lung cancer support groups in the area as well as co-ordinating a support group that is regularly reviewed by patients. “As well as this, she has driven forward a campaign to increase the awareness of lung cancer symptoms and has lead a team of her colleagues to visit local shopping centres and share leaflets ensuring members of the public are aware of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer. She is always looking at ways to get the message out there in innovative ways.” Sally continued: “Margaret is a wonderful resource of expert knowledge and she has certainly shown outstanding leadership in cancer and palliative care for almost  years’ service. “We are delighted that she has agreed tofor a short time following her retirement to ensure the service continues to deliver high quality care and we wish her the very best in her future, we will miss her.” Margaret concluded: “Although I have officially retired from my full-time post, I will continue in my role as a Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist two days a week for another year. “I will really miss my colleagues and all the people that I have met and cared for over the years.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year more than ever, it is important to celebrate the incredible contributions that nurses make to our society. One such inidual who deserves a special mention is Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist Margaret Carlin who was named Cancer Nurse of the Year  at the Royal College of Nursing Awards NI. Margaret is from Magherafelt and is based at Antrim Area Hospital. She has been caring for local people for almost  years and has just retired from her full-time post. googletag.cmd.push Margaret took up her role as a Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialist in the Mid Ulster Hospital in . “My post was created as a result of collaboration between Macmillan Cancer Support and what is now the Northern Health and Social Care Trust,” recalls Margaret. “It was important to have a full-time nurse specialist who could provide expert advice, support and information to patients who were living with cancer or a le limiting illness.” Following Margaret’s appointment, her sterling work in the community was well known. Funds, however, were needed to continue to support her role and this inspired a group of iniduals in the Magherafelt area to form a fundraising committee. googletag.cmd.push In their time, Magherafelt Fundraising Committee raised over pound,, pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support in Northern Ireland. “Over the years I have met and cared for many people with cancer and other le limiting conditions, often at times of great distress for them, their families and loved ones,” explains Margaret. “They have allowed me into their lives and to be with them throughout their illness. They have shared their thoughts and feelings with me and told me about their hopes and fears for the future. We laughed together and sometimes we cried together. “Throughout the years, I continue to meet people who I met at the time when they were diagnosed with cancer.     “I am always glad to see them and it makes me really happy to see the quality of le they continue to have. I also meet many families whose loved ones I cared for, who sadly have died, and I am always touched that they remember me and the times we spent together. “They tell me about their lives now and changes there have been. “They tell me how their children and grandchildren have grown up and are doing well and this reminds me that I will always be part of their memories and how privileged I am to be a Macmillan nurse.” Margaret initially trained as a nursing student in Mid Ulster Hospital from - and following this worked as a staff nurse in the Mid Ulster Hospital. It was in October  that she became a Macmillan nurse, delivering chemotherapy to patients as well as helping to set up and establish palliative care services. In , Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital as Macmillan Lung Cancer Nurse Specialist. “Since Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital, she has worked tirelessly to raise the standards of the care delivered to patients diagnosed with lung cancer,” explains Sally Convery, Macmillan Service Lead for Palliative Care. “Margaret is passionate about caring for the inidual and is very focused on ensuring patients are recognised as people and not by their diagnosis. “She encourages them to focus on the positive aspects of le and not on their diagnosis. Margaret is an excellent role model to the other lung cancer nurses and demonstrates her passion for ensuring safe and effective care. “She continually strives to improve the patient’s quality of le and has shown outstanding commitment to the creation and delivery of a pulmonary prehabilitation self-management programme for patients with lung cancer. “Margaret believes it is important services are delivered with patients and relatives at the forefront and because of this she is involved in and promotes ious lung cancer support groups in the area as well as co-ordinating a support group that is regularly reviewed by patients. “As well as this, she has driven forward a campaign to increase the awareness of lung cancer symptoms and has lead a team of her colleagues to visit local shopping centres and share leaflets ensuring members of the public are aware of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer. She is always looking at ways to get the message out there in innovative ways.” Sally continued: “Margaret is a wonderful resource of expert knowledge and she has certainly shown outstanding leadership in cancer and palliative care for almost  years’ service. “We are delighted that she has agreed tofor a short time following her retirement to ensure the service continues to deliver high quality care and we wish her the very best in her future, we will miss her.” Margaret concluded: “Although I have officially retired from my full-time post, I will continue in my role as a Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist two days a week for another year. “I will really miss my colleagues and all the people that I have met and cared for over the years.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McKaigue has received the all-clear and has been involved in some of the football in recent weeks.Speaking last week, Gallagher feels McKaigue probably hasnt had the amount of football under his belt for the start of the league, with the management erring on the side of caution with histo action.“We believe he will be fully fit and available for the Longford game,” added the Derry boss who termed McKaiguesas brilliant news.“One thing for sure, his Achilles is  percent recovered,” Gallagher stated. “Will he pick up another setback  I dont believe he will, he looks in great nick but he just needs plenty of football.”Meanwhile, Gallagher is happy that another Slaughtneil duo, Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers, are back going well after going under the kne for knee injuries.Gallagher revealed that both were fortunate to feature in last Autumns Ulster championship defeat to Armagh.“They have had a lot of wear and tear over the last five, six, seven years, but they are back going well...they look after themselves phenomenally,” Gallagher added.“They were meniscus injuries, needing eight to nine weeks to recover. Theyplayed the latter stages of the club championship, the two National League gamesand the championship against Armagh, thats the type of characters we want.”Midfielder Padraig Cassidy was also playing through a niggly hip injury over the past few seasons for club and county. There were reports of surgery being required in the long-term and he managed his progress with injections, but Derry are boosted by his full recovery, having also been given the all clear at a clinic in Santry, following his rehabilitation programme.“Hehas worked phenomenally hard, often twice a day, and he is injury free,” Gallagher said of Cassidys progress. “He is totally injury free and moving really well. That is a massive plus as well.”Glens Jack Doherty, apart from a brief appearance in the McKenna Cup defeat to Monaghan in December , missed all of Derrys  season and Gallagher is happy to have him back in the selection mix.“He is fully fit and injury free. He looks good and is moving really well, has been able to do all the work and looks in good shape.”Ruairi Mooney also missed all of last season and Shea Downey, one of  players handed their inter-county senior debuts by Gallagher, are also back in full training.Gallagher stated that he had no long-term injuries in the -man squad, with Magherafelt defender Conor McCluskey the only one on the doubtful list for this weekend.“Clucky got a collision on his knee at training. It is not too serious, it might be a slight doubt at this stage,” he said.Ballinderry utility player Gareth McKinless, who withdrew from the  early in , is back in the fold after reaching out to the management to express his interest in a .“Since we agreed to move forward, Gareth has put the head down and I have been very pleased with his level of performance.“Gareth phoned us telling us he wanted to play, that is a good sign and we are delighted to have him.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McKaigue has received the all-clear and has been involved in some of the football in recent weeks.Speaking last week, Gallagher feels McKaigue probably hasnt had the amount of football under his belt for the start of the league, with the management erring on the side of caution with histo action.“We believe he will be fully fit and available for the Longford game,” added the Derry boss who termed McKaiguesas brilliant news.“One thing for sure, his Achilles is  percent recovered,” Gallagher stated. “Will he pick up another setback  I dont believe he will, he looks in great nick but he just needs plenty of football.”Meanwhile, Gallagher is happy that another Slaughtneil duo, Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers, are back going well after going under the kne for knee injuries.Gallagher revealed that both were fortunate to feature in last Autumns Ulster championship defeat to Armagh.“They have had a lot of wear and tear over the last five, six, seven years, but they are back going well...they look after themselves phenomenally,” Gallagher added.“They were meniscus injuries, needing eight to nine weeks to recover. Theyplayed the latter stages of the club championship, the two National League gamesand the championship against Armagh, thats the type of characters we want.”Midfielder Padraig Cassidy was also playing through a niggly hip injury over the past few seasons for club and county. There were reports of surgery being required in the long-term and he managed his progress with injections, but Derry are boosted by his full recovery, having also been given the all clear at a clinic in Santry, following his rehabilitation programme.“Hehas worked phenomenally hard, often twice a day, and he is injury free,” Gallagher said of Cassidys progress. “He is totally injury free and moving really well. That is a massive plus as well.”Glens Jack Doherty, apart from a brief appearance in the McKenna Cup defeat to Monaghan in December , missed all of Derrys  season and Gallagher is happy to have him back in the selection mix.“He is fully fit and injury free. He looks good and is moving really well, has been able to do all the work and looks in good shape.”Ruairi Mooney also missed all of last season and Shea Downey, one of  players handed their inter-county senior debuts by Gallagher, are also back in full training.Gallagher stated that he had no long-term injuries in the -man squad, with Magherafelt defender Conor McCluskey the only one on the doubtful list for this weekend.“Clucky got a collision on his knee at training. It is not too serious, it might be a slight doubt at this stage,” he said.Ballinderry utility player Gareth McKinless, who withdrew from the  early in , is back in the fold after reaching out to the management to express his interest in a .“Since we agreed to move forward, Gareth has put the head down and I have been very pleased with his level of performance.“Gareth phoned us telling us he wanted to play, that is a good sign and we are delighted to have him.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With new movie Stealth due to premiere before the end of this month, the company is currently working on Grief, a film detailing the pain and loss caused by the Covid- pandemic. The second instalment of Long Shot, entitled Long Shot’s Letter, is also due for completion. After Grief is shot and edited by mid-June, its on to West Banksy which will deal with drug addiction and abuse. googletag.cmd.push The groups alternative news programme, It’s News To Me, will be launched in September and it is hoped three more short films by the end of the year, one of which will focus on bullying in the secondary sector. Joseph McCarthy, writer, director and producer with Black North, which he founded, said: “We have already sourced school ties and shirts and will need to source jumpers, trousers and skirts too. “In between times, we will complete the third part of our Troubles’ Trilogy, so we will be very busy for some time. We will also be casting for new members when the lockdown lts.” googletag.cmd.push Joseph said Black North Productions was formed to get the message out there that the North of Ireland is not a place to avoid, not a place of hate and despair. He added: “The North of Ireland is a beautul place, populated by friendly people who have been trapped by history that is not of our making. We aim to show the positive aspects of Northern Ireland, that is second to no other place in artistic talent.” Joe explained how Black North came into being. “We came about due to a marked lack of opportunity for people who had artistic ability, but in essence no real outlet. I began writing poetry and plays some years ago and I wrongly assumed that long established arts venues would nurture new talent.     “A good example of this was when I tried to get one of my plays performed in the city. I approached the then chief executive of that venue and spoke with a  of their governing body regarding getting some assistance to have my play produced. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that there was an insular attitude and mercenary outlook, which left me both surprised and disappointed. “Needless to say, I have had no contact with either that venue or those art experts since. It’s interesting to note, that the play I approached them with which was called Enough is Enough won the University of Ulster’s Greer Garson Award for Theatre soon after that meeting. I formed the impression that I was being grilled on that occasion and that in itself, was an unpleasant experience. “I came up with idea of forming Black North Productions and at that particular time, the North of Ireland was being avoided by many people from the Republic of Ireland and the UK. The Nordies were cast in a dark light that we simply did not deserve to be in that position. I set out to show that we in the North, and in particular our city, can produce poetry, plays and short films that can be deemed as artistic works of the highest quality. “There was never any formal meeting or expressions of interest highlighted at that time. I came up with idea, developed the idea, enlisted the help of others who were of the same mind-set, both regarding the attitudes of outsiders to the North of Ireland and the dismal lack of assistance that prevailed in the city and unfortunately still does to a large extent.” Black Norths first film was Wish You Were Here. Joe explained its storyline: “It revolved around a writer played by Greta McTeague, who whilst writing a detective novel gets, side-tracked by the historic events that have happened in the city. The film opens in  and in her mind she imagines she is speaking with the people from that time. The central character is the likeable and fair- minded Michael Quinlivan. I intended to produce a Trouble’s Trilogy moving from  to  and then to present day. “The theme was in essence about the Trouble’s children, who lived through that period, suffered so much and yet seamlessly formed bonds with total strangers who shared the same experiences and through those experience formed bonds that still exist today.” To date, Black North has made six films – as well as Wish You Were Here, there has been Right Reasons For Wrong, Long Shot, F-, Unlucky Lucky and andSnowflake Generation. Joseph added: “We will premiere Stealth by the end of the month and have quite a lot of work completed on our final Troubles film, Half Ticket No Return. but due to such a large cast and the urrent restrictions, we have had to put that one onhold.” Joseph said Stealth was a really interesting piece. He added: “It is set in both present day and the future and shows our technical abilities and innovations through an intriguing storyline that will make people sit up and think. It is very much an Orwellian piece with a modern twist.” Black North is currently working on Grief, telling the story of loss due to the pandemic. Joe said it came about for a number of reasons. He added: “Having known so many people who have lost loved ones and listened to their heart-wrenching stories of not getting to say that final goodbye, or to be there when they felt they were most needed, made me feel that there needs to be some kind of closure. A chance to say that final farewell.” Joseph conceded the films topic was dficult topic to deal with it. He said: “As we all know, Covid- has had a devastating effect on so many people and has brought entire countries to a standstill. “It was a dficult topic to deal with in a sensitive and constructive way, I have done my best to alleviate the sense of loss and hurt that this terrible virus has caused. “I really hope that we, as a team, have done that. From our extras, who will play mourners, to the bikers who will escort the coffin into the city, to our choir and central characters played by Jamie Coll, Chantel Carlin, Gabriel White, Kieran Dallas, Corey Hanna and Dean O’Donnell, I really hope we have.” So, how did the bikers become involved  Joseph explained: “Gerry McGeady, a leading light with Centurions MC, is the main man when it came to organising bikers. “Gerry is a well-respected biker of many years and has strong connections to the world of bikers and, in particular, the local clubs. “I have to thank him for all his efforts in bringing together a dedicated bunch of bikers in the form of The Exiles RC and The Centurions MCC. “The bikers are a great team to work with and they are keen to become involved in Grief as they too understand the immense sense of loss felt by so many people.” Joseph said Black Norths was very proud of its wide range of cast members. He said: “The pandemic has made casting for parts very dficult for us, but we have done our best to continue to bring in new members and Grief will comprise of several new member and a younger cast. “Quite often, a member will suggest a family member who would suit a part or a friend or relative and once we give that person a piece to perform and have a chat with him her, we then film them and take it from there. “We are proud of our wide and ied cast members. “We have people from all backgrounds such as: bricklayers, plasterers, council workers, accountants, health care workers, secondary school pupils, students, basically from every walk of le. “Some people were hesitant and lacked confidence, those same people are now much more confident and outgoing. “Indeed, this has been one of greatest achievements to date, to see people develop and grow in confidence, people who would never have had an opportunity to become involved in film.”                                         --  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

The state of the road, a main commuter route between Draperstown, Maghera and Omagh, has been the cause of concern for some time. Local MLA Emma Sheerin welcomed the commencement of the work and has urged the community to be patient during the associated road closures. “Myself and party colleagues Cllr Brian McGuigan and Cllr Catherine Elattar have been raising the issue of the Sixtowns Road and the need for full resurfacing for years now,” she said. “We are constantly being told by residents that the state of the road is a hazard, due to its many potholes and uneven surfaces, and the fact that it is not on the gritting schedule every winter. googletag.cmd.push This is a main route between South Derry towns such as Ballinascreen and Maghera, and Omagh, were many travel for work, and the state of this road has been a massive cause for concern for a long time. “I want to thank the local section engineers who have worked to deliver this request, and ask people to be mindful of the very necessary ersions which will be in place for the next  weeks. “Obviously, we understand that the complete closure to through traffic and local access in stretches will cause massive inconvenience in the short term, and we appreciate peoples patience with this. googletag.cmd.push “However, given the width of the road the work cannot happen with vehicles travelling through, so we hope that all road users will recognise that this will be worth it in the end.” Ms Sheerin also said she was hopeful the work could be extended to include a longer stretch of road in the area. “I am delighted to confirm that work is beginning from the Blackrock Road junction down towards Ballinascreen, with the hope that the full road as far as Shibbys might get done this time,” she said. “We are pushing for this, and as no other big projects are included in this years schedule, there is a possibility that it could happen.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fairhill and Plantin areas of Draperstown are set for a major overhaul as part of the scheme, with the latter having been plagued by anti social behaviour in recent years. Sinn Feacutein councillor for the area, Catherine Ellatar, has said she hopes the work will be the first step in ing the Plantin to its former glory. “Unfortunately the Plantin has a long history of anti social behaviour,” she said. “I would love for that to change and for people and especially our young people to see it as a communal resource that we can all spend time in, enjoy nature and be proud of. googletag.cmd.push “Vandalism destroys this area for everyone in the village and the cost of repairs has to be met by local rate payers, who are the parents and grandparents of those causing the damage. “They should think of our local area as an extension of their homes and treat it and local residents with the respect and kindness they would expect to be treated with themselves. “I realise the pandemic has meant that young people have not been able to get out and take part in the sporting and social activities they would usually do, over the past year. “I would encourage them to see themselves as the important part of our local community that they are and join with us all in contributing to the great community spirit that exists in Ballinascreen.” googletag.cmd.push The Fairhill is a historic site in the centre of Draperstown, and Cllr Ellatar is hoping it can become a valuable part of the village once again. “The Fairhill has been in a state of disrepair for some time and its great to see work starting to make it a valuable part of the village again,” she said. “It used to be where the sheep sales took place and on a market day, it was a central part of the village. It will be lovely to see it being used again by residents and visitors. “Council officers and our local Sinn Feacutein team have worked hard to secure a lease for the Fairhill and the funding to carry out the work to it and to the Plantin.     “We live in a beautul part of the Sperrins and over recent years we have seen a lot of visitors to the area and hopefully that will continue. “Our local businesses are opening up again and I’m sure would welcome more visitors and potential customers.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

US President Joe Biden, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be among those attending the UN Climate Change World Conference in Glasgow in November. Their decison-making will be influenced by the artwork of local schoolgirl, Alex Patterson, from Eglinton, and four other talented young artists. It follows the Year  student at Foyle Colleges art entry, Mother Earth, winning the prestigious UN Climate Change World Conference Creative Earth competition which had over , entries googletag.cmd.push The judging , included former Spice Girl Geri Horner and COP president, Alok Sharma. The judges said they were particularly impressed and inspired by Alex’s entry because of the way she brought the continents together to look after Mother Nature, depicting animals we need to protect and the technologies that will enable this. Geri Horner was so impressed with Alexs piece, that she will eventually get to own it and put it on display with her collection of artwork at her countryside home. Congratulting all five winners, the former Spice Girl posted on her Twitter account: “Congrats Alex, Yumna, Vedantika, Isla and Emma for winning the Creative Earth competition. Amazed and inspired by the creativity of young people from across the UK and we’re excited to showcase their artwork to the world at COP this November.” googletag.cmd.push Alexs achievement was reported worldwide at the weekend when she featured on Sky News on Saturday and on the channels FYI news slot for young people yesterday morning. On the programme, she explained the thinking behind her design. She said: “It is basically a tree but instead of branches there are seven hands and these represent the seven continents and in the hands there is Mother Nature. So, basically,everyone came together then we will be able to protect Mother Nature.” She said she was confident the world leaders would take notice of her and the other pieces of artwork.     She said: ”I think we have made it pretty clear in all of our drawings what we think is wrong and how we can make it better.” Meanwhile, Alex recently submitted three pieces to the Royal Academy of Arts in London, with hopes of selection for the Summer Show Exhibition. In May last year, Alex, a former pupil of Eglinton Primary School, raised pound, for the Western Trusts Covid- ward at Altnagelvin Hospital by completing a -hour painting marathon.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Strong partnership working, sharing information and joined up messaging are key across the North West was the message from the Mayors of Derry City, Strabane and Donegal, attending a meeting to discuss the Covid- response in the region. The meeting this week was co-chaired by the two Mayors, Cllr Brian Tierney Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council and An Cathaoirleach Cllr Rena Donaghey of Donegal County Council It was set up to discuss the cross border approach to the COVID  rates across the North West. googletag.cmd.push It was attended by the Chair and Vice Chair of the North West Regional Development Group, Cllr Sandra Duffyand Cllr Ciaran Brogan , as well as the Chief Executives of Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council, John Kelpie and John McLaughlin, along with senior Council officials from both Councils. Those attending the meeting were provided with details of the current Covid- infection rates across their respective Council areas and heard about the proactive work being done by both Councils to support the statutory agencies in responding to the pandemic and how they are adapting services and providing support as the NW reopens at the ying stages of recovery. googletag.cmd.push While concern was expressed at the high infection rate in both Council areas, there was general acknowledgement that compliance was high across the region with the majority of the public adhering to the guidelines and taking all the necessary steps in order to keep each other safe. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Cllr Brian Tierney said the region faced challenges as a result of the iance in the lting of restrictions but that he was confident people on both sides of the border were acting responsibly. He thanked the public for their commitment and support to date urging them to continue to make good decisions.     As the restrictions are lted gradually on both sides of the border, he said it is important everyone continues to act cautiously and adhere to the messages around social distancing, wearing face coverings and regular hand sanitisation. He said: The people of the North West have been amazing throughout this pandemic. They have rallied around one another and supported each other in dficult times. However, its important that we understand that Covid hasnt gone away – its still here and its still spreading. Its still important that we dont let our guard down that we continue to look out for one another. There are small things we can do to protect each other – when we are out walking and see friends we must stand back and keep a distance, when we are going to the shops we must remember to take our face masks and our hand sanitiser and give other customers some space. An Cathaoirleach Cllr Rena Donaghey acknowledged the huge amount of work being done by the two councils, the statutory agencies and health bodies on both sides of the border. She said the strong partnership approach and collaborative work to respond to the Covid- numbers in the region was key in reducing the rate of infection. She said the roll out of the vaccination programmes was hugely positive in providing hope for the future and that all this was good news in providing support to businesses as the Councils work together to rebuild the NW economy. Cllr Donaghey said: We are a region that relies on one another. We have strong family and business connections and our lives are intertwined in everything that we do. It is important therefore in the days ahead and coming weeks and that we avoid attributing blame but work together towards a common goal of protecting our communities from this virus. The people of Donegal, Derry and Strabane are one community, we look out for one another and support one another through thick and thin. Lets continue to do that and work together to keep each other safe so that we can look forward to a better future for all of us. It was agreed at the meeting that the Councils and statutory agencies would continue to share information and work collectively in the weeks and months ahead as the North West region takes small cautious steps towards recovery.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

It wasnrsquot long after that I got on the saddle for the first time and I got going from there, said Danny.The golden boy started off with Downpatrick trainer Brian Hamilton before working with group one winning flat trainer Ger Lyons in Kildare.On the advice of former Grand National winner Tony Dobbin, Danny then made his big move across the water to Penrith in Cumbria to work under the highly respected trainer Nicky Richards at his famous Greystoke stables.ldquoI was only  when I turned professional and made the move to England. I was very nervous, but Nicky made me feel really welcomed and I settled in quickly, he recalled.ldquoIt was tough at the beginning to be fair but Nicky is very easy to get on with and he knew it was going to be dficult for me. He made things very straight forward and it didnrsquot take long for me to get the hang of things.The rider credits the first big moment of his blossoming career to when he rode the   shot Nietzsche, trained by Brian Ellison, to first place in the grade three Greatwood Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham when he was just  in November .ldquoIt was something that was unexpected and maybe came a bit out of the blue. It really helped my career and put me on the radar to a lot of people.Danny has ridden a number of horses on his path to success but does share a special bond with one in particular.ldquoNuts Well is my favourite horse. We have competed a lot together and Irsquove developed my skills with him a lot, we have picked up six or seven wins this season together he said.ldquoThat horse has helped me get to the grade one stage of racing, especially after our massive grade two win.That grade two success was when Danny and Nuts Well secured first place in the valuable Old Roan at Aintree. Nuts Well was picked for an outsider in the race at  , but the talented rider once again showed he was worth his salt as he galloped to glory.This gave Northumberland trainer Ann Hamilton her biggest success to date as they claimed the pound, prize pot.Despite his interest and success in racing, Danny was the first in his family to become heavily involved in the sport.ldquoI come from a sporting background in my family, my two brothers played Gaelic football and soccer growingup, but I was the one who took it upon myself to get into the horses, he said.ldquoOf course my family supported me and helped me achieve were I am today, but I do not come from a racing background.Dannyrsquos parents, Brenda and Denis, were delighted as their son received recognition for an outstanding season and hope that this is just the beginning for the promising young talent.ldquoWe are so proud of him, he has done all of this off his own back, said Brenda.ldquoHe has worked extremely hard to get to this point and I am so glad he is living his dream.ldquoEven though I canrsquot watch his big hurdle races until the final straight as I always have a motherrsquos worry, she added.Danny spent a brief time back with family in Downpatrick but is getting back to business as usual in England.ldquoI just plan on keeping my head down and hope to bring the momentum from this season into the next one, he said.ldquoEverything wouldnrsquot be possible without the help from all of the team at the stables and my familyrsquos support.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

These exams were in speech and drama and acting.Clare said: ldquoFor the speech and drama grades the pupils have the opportunity to study poetry and stories. They learn to recite these with confidence, clear expression and articulation.ldquoThey learn how to discuss their work with the examiner and it is wonderful to watch their communication skills develop. It is amazing to see how each of these pupils have developed in confidence and the exams are a wonderful way to mark this achievement.ldquoAs pupils progress through the grades, they learn so much about how the voice works along with literary techniques which, in turn, helps them with literacy and English at school.She continued: ldquoSome senior pupils chose to do the acting pathway which involved them studying plays and monologues and understand how to develop characterisation, all the while enhancing their voice, movement, gesture and facial expression.ldquoThe acting exams are very like the audition process which some of the pupils have taken part in before for local casting agents.

Local agencies cannot be left alone to pick up the pieces and restore this fragile habitat.ldquoThe environment minister must urgently convene a cross-departmental taskforce that brings together the experience, focus and most importantly, resources, in order to meet the unprecedented challenges in rejuvenating this area.Mr Hazzard said the scenes of environmental destruction left in the Mournes as a result of the inferno show the urgent need to protect precious habitats, especially our peatlands.He added: ldquoIf managed correctly, peatlands play an important role in supporting rich ecosystems, improving water quality and also protecting our communities from the localised consequences of climate change.ldquoFor some time now a draft peatlands strategy has sat with the minister awaiting publication there can be no more delay. Minister Poots must publish this strategy as soon as possible.Meanwhile, the petition urging a ban on the sale of disposal barbecues in shops and supermarkets is gathering increasing support.The resident behind the petition said that every year a number of businesses push the the sale of cheap, disposable barbecues, which are frequently taken to be used in parks and green spaces, often without the landowners permission.ldquoIn many cases, having already scorched the ground below, these barbecues are frequently left, giving rise to wild fires. Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great. These cheap, lightweight disposable barbecues, are not to be socially acceptable any longer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Rosaleen.jpg","title":"Rosaleen praises family on her 100th birthday  ","story":"BORN the day before Northern Ireland came into being  years ago, Rosaleen Rogan celebrated her centenary in style on Sunday.The long and happy le of the devoted parishioner was celebrated at Holy Family Church in Teconnaught with a special Mass dedicated to her by the parish priest, Father Brendan Smyth.The mother-of-five, grandmother to  and great-grandmother to  was greeted by her family and friends staggered throughout the day after the service and at home.Said by her family to ldquostill buzzing on Monday, Mrs Rogan was overwhelmed by the amount of cards, flowers and Mass bouquets given to her to mark her momentous day.As May  in  was recently decreed as the day Northern Ireland was constituted, Mrs Rogan, who lives with her daughter, Mrs Stella Rea in Magheralone, is one of the last surviving Irish-born citizens in Northern Ireland.Her th birthday was recognised by both states with a card from the Queen and a letter from Irish President Michael D Higgins along with a cheque for pound,.Mrs Rogan was also very touched to have been sent a Papal blessing, which was a gt from the parish organised by Fr Smyth, and a letter of congratulations from the Lord Lieutenant of Down, Mr David Lindsay.She was also delighted to receive a visit from family friend and former South Down MP, Baroness Margaret Ritchie who helped the family mark the birthday.Mrs Rogan, who hails from Annacloy, was also joined on Sunday by her two surviving brothers, Joe and Maurice McGrath, with their wives and her sister Marie at the Mass.She is the widow of the late Joe Rogan, a well-known shoemaker and repairer in Drumaness, and often helped him with stitching jobs in the business over the years.The couple shared a devotion to their faith and celebrated  years of marriage on September .

This is what led to a conversation with Cathy, who had a shared love and passion for the sport, she continued.ldquoWe both agreed it would be amazingwe could bring young girls together to play camogie. The success of St. Kevinrsquos would not have been possible without the drive from both parishes.The newly formed committee is made up of a number of associated members from both clubs, who all share the same common goal of teaching camogie to as many girls as possible whilst ensuring a longevity to develop and establish the club.Cathy said it was ldquoan absolute honour to play a part in the creation of St Kevinrsquos.ldquoAs a Drumaness Gael I know that a very special lady, Annie Gelston, a Drumaness camogie legend, will be looking down with pride, said Mason.ldquoI would like to say a special word of thanks to the Drumaness and Teconnaught clubs for their unwavering support over the past few weeks, not only in the initial set-up but also with use of their pitches and facilities.The club held their first training session together at the Teconnaught club grounds on Saturday and it was evident that there is a potential successful future ahead based on the turnout of participants.ldquoTherersquos not many times in my le Irsquove been lost for words, but describing my emotions and feelings of Saturday is definitely one of them, said Maria.ldquoWe had over  girls show up for our first training session, over  in our senior ladies and U- session and over  in our sessions for the younger girls, she added.Cathy also reflected on the historic first training session, describing it as a ldquospecial moment as she watched the ldquomany smiles on the faces of the young children having fun and hopefully falling in love with the wonderful sport of camogie.Since many of the girls in all of the age groups had never attended a camogie training session before, the highly experienced coaches, who have backgrounds in both hurling and camogie, began teaching the basics to get them familiar with holding a hurley and making contact with the sliotar.Several dferent training drills were also incorporated to get the new recruits comfortable on the pitch.ldquoIt is very important to me and the coaches that we made this past Saturday and all future sessions a positive experience for the girls, said Maria.ldquoSo many of them took to it so naturally and we canrsquot wait to see how they progress over the season.St Kevinrsquos now eagerly look ahead to their first match against Ballela on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12601014.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As part of this process, concern was raised about the potential ision caused by the use of minority languages in public spaces however, that moves us inevitably to the use of flags and emblems, often with paramilitary symbols, to mark territory.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The FICT Commission’s work involved all parties and included engagement events across Northern Ireland. Its aim was to develop a response to this, enabling flags and emblems to be displayed in a celebratory and appropriate manner and to move away from their use for intimidation and exclusion. A shared space does not necessarily mean a neutral space but it does mean any display of flags, emblems and memorials should be reasonable, appropriate and sensitive to the ersity in our society.The truth is the last leader of unionism stalled this work.The first minister’s idea of outreach was to approach representatives of paramilitary groups and the loyal orders, without reflecting the true ersity across our society and the desire in many communities to move past paramilitarism.One priority challenge of the new leaders of unionism will be to take this work forward, reflecting that Northern Ireland is a erse and shared society and recognising that a quarter of a century after the Agreement the prominence given to paramilitaries in certain communities is unacceptable. During the leadership contests, I hope we will hear a commitment to meaningful outreach, to work with the rest of us to deliver on the FICT Commission’s work, and to move towards a genuinely inclusive Northern Ireland with shared space maximised and paramilitary control a thing of the past.Paula Bradshaw, Alliance MLA, South Belfast——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Ireland did not hesitate to police the border when it thought it appropriate.Yet Northern Ireland is, in effect, not allowed to police the border in , even when we are far ahead on vaccinations.Stormont should today confirm the May  reopening of outlets such as restaurants, and outline a clear route to changes in mixing of households, travel and tourism, including the essentialof free movement within the Common Travel Area.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNasir Adam - Plaid CymruRaised in Butetown, the son and grandson of merchant navy, Irsquove lived in Cardf South my whole le and itrsquos where I still work and live and itrsquos here Irsquom raising my family. During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I fear this is a missed opportunity to drive our economy forward and to create new jobs,” he said.“Our businesses have come through a marathon over the last year due to the pandemic. They have shown resilience and fortitude.“Policy-makers at the Department need to rethink their decision to better support local businesses.”Responding to these comments, a spokesperson for the Department for Communities acknowledged there is a desire from “some quarters” to see the transfer of these powers but added “it would not be possible to complete the passage of such legislation in the current mandate”.“For now the Department is working closely with councils in the delivery of regeneration programmes and this collaboration is working well at present,” said the spokesperson.“Local Government already plays a signicant role in ensuring the successful implementation of the Department’s regeneration programmes.“A key feature of all this work is the level of collaborative working that already exists between councils and the Department.“The relationship has been strengthened further in our joint response to COVID- where the Department collaborated with councils and other stakeholders to develop locally designed recovery plans funded through the COVID- Recovery Revitalisation Programme.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
