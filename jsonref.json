Use the next few weeks to practise your photography, taking daily shots as the garden starts to bloom in the warmer weather. You could even post your best photos on social media, or email them to friends and family to cheer them up. You\u0027ll find lots of good tips and articles online — just type into Google, \u0027improve your garden photography\u0027. Some of the techniques that professionals recommend include photographing the garden at sunrise, when the light is at its softest standing on a ladder to get a bird\u0027s-eye view and investing in a small smartphone tripod (you can get them by mail order at amazon.co.uk for under £20). A good book is The Garden Photography Workshop by Andrea Jones (available on amazon.co.uk, for £17.99, or only £1.98 as a ­Kindle book). STAKE PLANTS This is one of those tasks that most of us (me included) put off for far too long, with predictably dire consequences: by high summer, plants that should be standing tall and proud are collapsing all over the place. If you\u0027re growing peonies, dahlias, delphiniums, oriental poppies, foxgloves, sunflowers and the taller forms of salvias, they will need support with canes and soft twine. The trick is to do it early in the season before the plants have put on too much growth, so now is the perfect time. Create a framework of canes around the plant (the plant will soon disguise the supports as it grows) and don\u0027t tie it in too tightly — it needs to be able to move in the wind. Staking isn\u0027t the most exciting job to do in the garden, but do it properly and your prize plants will look fantastic this summer. SUPPORT NURSERIESSupport nurseries The cancellation of RHS shows such as Cardiff, the Malvern Spring Show and, mostdevastating of all, the Chelsea Flower Show, has hit small nurseries hard. Many of them are bursting with stock and still very much open for mail order business. Britain has a world-class selection of specialist nurseries and it would be a tragedy if we lost them, so do support them if you can. Some of the best are Bluebell Cottage Gardens and Nursery in Cheshire (bluebellcottage.co.uk) and Edrom Nurseries in Scotland (good for alpines and woodland plants — edrom-nurseries.co.uk). Plus, Beth Chatto\u0027s Plants and Gardens in Essex (bethchatto. co.uk), Thorncroft Clematis in Norfolk (clematis and other climbers — thorncroftclematis.co.uk), Claire Austin Hardy Plants (claireaustin-hardyplants.co.uk) and Knoll Gardens in Dorset (a superb range of ornamental grasses — knollgardens.co.uk).SCATTER COMPOSTIf you\u0027ve been dutifully composting your garden and household organic waste, now is the time to get spreading. All that rotted material (which gardeners call mulch) will return valuable nutrients to the soil. You\u0027ll know the compost is ready to use when it has a pleasant, earthy smell and looks like dark, crumbly soil. Spread it around your beds and borders, about 3in (5cm) thick: either fork it in lightly or simply leave it to break down into the soil. If you don\u0027t have a compost bin, why not start one now? Apart from helping your garden, it will also cut down the amount of food and garden waste you throw out. You can buy a compost bin online (amazon.co.uk), or make your own bin by taking a dustbin with a clip-on lid and drilling holes in the top and the bottom. "},{"url":null,"title":"Ant Middleton admits mistake urging people coronavirus pandemic","story":"Share this article In the post earlier this week, the TV personality said: \u0027Am I still out travelling the world?

Wives were bruised and battered and children flogged, with dogs at the bottom of the pecking order. Dogs were often sacrificed in Greek and Roman rites to honour deities of the underworld, a practice some believed would delay their own death.  However the recent study suggests that the treatment of smaller dogs may have been more in line with the caring nature of modern pet owners, that is unless they were chosen for sacrifice.Roman author Pliny the Elder (AD23-79) described how a lapdog, such as a Maltese, could be used to soothe a woman\u0027s stomach ache, when held on the body like a water bottle - in his book \u0027Naturalis Historia\u0027.Brutus minimus: lap dogs date back to Romans | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Green MP Caroline Lucas broke Commons rules charging 150 head 30 minute guided tours","story":"Share this article It adds that use of publicly funded resources should \u0027not confer any undue personal or financial benefit on themselves or anyone else, or confer undue advantage on a political organisation.\u0027Ms Lucas initially argued that she could offer the tour as it was about \u0027someone accessing my time and experience\u0027.However, she has accepted the outcome of the investigation and apologised for the breach of standards.

Faced with a flood of images that includes migrant children in cages, melting glaciers and forest fires, it has felt impossible to process information, let alone assess the best way to react.We’ve entered an era characterised by the twin forces of speed and instability, in which a superabundance of potential threats – running from Islamic State to nuclear war, the rise of the far right, Brexit, environmental catastrophe and now a global pandemic – is matched by a dearth of time in which to process them. It’s impossible to keep up, and far too alarming to look away. Thanks to the accelerating effects of social media, it’s begun to seem as if the social landscape is shifting at such a rate that thinking, the act of making sense, is permanently balked. It’s increasingly difficult to distinguish real danger from rumours, speculations, conspiracy theories and deliberate lies, a process the spread of coronavirus around the globe has only intensified. Logging into Twitter or following the rolling news has meant being trapped in a spin-cycle of hypervigilant anxiety.During this febrile period, I’ve found myself longing for a different kind of timeframe, in which it would be possible both to feel and to think, to process the intense impact of the news and perhaps even to imagine other ways of being. The stopped time of a painting, say, or the dilations of the novel, in which it is possible to see patterns and consequences that are otherwise invisible. Art has begun to feel not like a respite or an escape, but a formidable tool for gaining perspective on what are increasingly troubled times.Can art do anything, especially during periods of crisis? In 1967, George Steiner wrote a famous essay about the deficiencies of art in the wake of the Holocaust. He argued that if a concentration camp commander could read Goethe and Rilke in the evening and still go about their duties at Auschwitz each day, then art had failed in its highest function, which he defined as the ability to humanise. The problem with this argument is that it implies for art to be successful it must act as a magic bullet, effortlessly reorganising moral faculties in effect obliterating free will.Art can’t forcibly induce a change in behaviour. It’s not a re-education pill. Empathy is not something that happens to us when we read War and Peace. It’s work, for which art can, however, provide us with radiant materials. Art can’t win an election or bring down a president. It can’t stop the climate crisis, cure a virus or raise the dead. What it can do is serve as an antidote to times of chaos. It can be a route to clarity, and it can be a force of resistance and repair, providing new registers, new languages in which to think.One of the problems with the internet as a source of information is that there is no end, no definitive conclusion to be reached. You travel link by link, pursuing digressions and counter-claims, interrupted by continuous breaking updates. The novel, by contrast, is a technology of orderly revelation, slowing and speeding time so as to trace connections and consequences down into hours, minutes, seconds, or out into decades, even centuries.Dickens is the master of this, and it strikes me that there can’t be many better figurations for what information-gathering feels like on social media than Krook’s Rag and Bottle shop in Bleak House. This “general emporium of much disregarded merchandise” is overflowing with indeterminate objects, among them blacking bottles and pickling bottles, heaps of parchment scrolls, rags and hundreds of rusty keys. Buried somewhere in this maddening chaos is, or might be, a vital document, without which clarity and justice will never be achieved.There’s a plague in Bleak House too, the hyper-contagious smallpox virus, which serves to underscore Dickens’s larger argument about interconnection, his determined attempt to show that social classes are not inviolate or impermeable, and that no group of people, no matter how grand or rich, are truly separate from their neighbours, no matter how poor or abject. The fever doesn’t respect titles or addresses, racing indiscriminately from the London slum of Tom-All-Alone to Bleak House itself. Esther catches it because she insists on helping the abject, homeless orphan Jo, shivering and stumbling from ditch to doorway, always being moved on. Realising she too is sick, she establishes herself in rigorous quarantine, knowing that by locking the door on her dear friend Ada, she is carrying out an act of love. “As she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace,” she instructs, “come no nearer than the garden”: the tender message of self-isolators everywhere.One of the pleasures of Bleak House is that it’s a drama about the act of information-gathering itself, slowly and laboriously producing clarity and order out of lies, misinformation and occlusion. Back in the early 1990s, the critic and queer studies pioneer Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick wrote an illuminating essay about this vexed and essential process. Sedgwick was once described by Maggie Nelson as “fat, freckled, prone to blushing, bedecked in textiles, generous, uncannily sweet, almost sadistically intelligent and, by the time I met her, terminally ill”. She wrote “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You’re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You” at the centre of the Aids crisis, at a time when many of her closest friends and colleagues were dying difficult and painful deaths, and she herself was undergoing treatment for the breast cancer that later killed her.Though it was written predominantly for an academic audience, “Paranoid Reading” is about something that affects us all, which is how we approach knowledge and uncertainty, as we do constantly in the course of our daily lives, and particularly at times of disaster or rapid political change. Sedgwick begins by describing the paranoid approach, so common and widely practised that we sometimes forget there are alternatives to it.A paranoid reader is concerned with gathering information, tracing links and exposing secrets. They anticipate and are perennially defended against catastrophe and disappointment. They’re always on the lookout for danger, about which they can never, ever know enough. Paranoia can be an appropriate mode in circumstances like those we’re in now, when knowledge is crucial and swift reactions matter. As the poet Anne Boyer observes in a much-shared essay about coronavirus, “fear educates our care for each other – we fear a sick person might be made sicker, or that a poor person’s life might be made even more miserable, and we do whatever we can to protect them because we fear a version of human life in which everyone lives only for themselves. I am not the least bit afraid of this kind of fear, for fear is a vital and necessary part of love.”The difficulty lies in gauging the level and amount of information it’s useful to acquire. How much does the average citizen need to know about epidemiology or viral loads? Does the accumulated store of possible scenarios help a person to act safely or does it paralyse their capacity to act at all? Furthermore, how much of what is read is true, and how much is being used to convey a more sinister message, like Trump’s constant harping on a “foreign” virus, his deployment of a disease to broadcast propaganda about closed borders? At their worst, Twitter, Facebook and the like can be a factory for manufacturing speculation and mistrust, in which material travels more rapidly the more frightening it is, providing comprehensive evidence for hopelessness and dread.Sedgwick’s essay arose out of a conversation in the mid-1980s with her friend Cindy Patton, an activist-historian of the Aids epidemic. At the time, there were rumours that Aids might have been deliberately engineered by the US military. Sedgwick was excited to hear what Patton thought and startled by her reply. “Suppose … that the lives of Africans and African Americans are worthless in the eyes of the United States that gay men and drug users are held cheap where they aren’t actively hated that the military deliberately researches ways to kill non-combatants whom it sees as enemies that people in power look calmly on the likelihood of catastrophic environmental and population changes,” she said. “Supposing we were ever so sure of all those things – what would we know then that we don’t already know?”What Sedgwick took away from this “congenial pessimism”, which strikes a definite echo with the present day, is that it isn’t always necessary to track down every piece of information about a crisis in order to respond effectively to it. Patton’s statement made her realise that there are other valid concerns for the artist, the activist, the citizen faced by emergency or disaster. At the very end of her essay, she briefly, tantalisingly floats another possible approach, which is more concerned with creativity and repair than the so-called hermeneutics of suspicion.A useful analogy for what Sedgwick terms the “reparative” is to be fundamentally more invested in finding nourishment than identifying poison, a drive she locates in artists as erse as the realist painter Jack Smith, artist Joseph Cornell, film-maker John Waters and Nightwood author Djuna Barnes. This is not the same thing as being naive or heedless, unaware of crisis or undamaged by oppression. Instead, it’s about being driven to find or invent something new and vital out of inimical environments. “What we can best learn from such practices,” Sedgwick explains, “are the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture – even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.”Sedgwick’s faith in art was hard-won, and derived in part from the crucial role it played during the plague years of the Aids crisis. In contrast to the rapid international public health response to coronavirus, the first cases of “gay cancer” in California and New York in 1981 were met with apathy and derision. In 1984, by which time 5,596 deaths had occurred in the US and it was estimated 300,000 people had been exposed to the virus, the Reagan press officer was still responding to questions about the epidemic by joking about the journalist’s possible infection status. Reagan himself didn’t say the word “Aids” until 17 September 1985. By the end of that year, 12,529 people had died.In such a situation, visibility mattered. In 1987, a six-person collective of artists in New York created the “Silence  Death” graphic, which became the international logo of Aids activism. This stark phrase was emblazoned in white letters on a black background beneath a pink triangle, taken from the insignia homosexuals were made to wear in concentration camps. It served to brand the call to arms, a crisp refutation of stigmatisation and homophobia.If silence equalled death, then part of the work of resistance was to make the fact of enforced silencing visible, as well as conveying something of the damage it caused. In 1989, the American artist and Act Up activist David Wojnarowicz posed for a famous photograph. He gazes furiously at the camera, his lips sutured with five loose stitches. Three thin trickles of blood run down his chin. In this distressing image, hurt and repair are fused. The needle works through flesh, self-inflicted wounds announcing larger harm.In our own era, the act of lip-sewing has been adopted by refugees. I’ve seen photographs of refugees with stitched lips made on the border between Greece and Macedonia, in an Australian immigration centre in Papua New Guinea, in Athens all places where borders are closed to certain bodies and free passage is impeded. In these cases, the image possesses an uncanny power. It can travel where the body can’t. It migrates and strays, taking up permanent residence in the mind, revealing what – who – has been forcibly excluded from sight.The desire to unveil hidden cruelty is also at work in a series of performances about rape carried out in the early 1970s by the Cuban-American artist Ana Mendieta, while she was still a student at the University of Iowa. In 1973, a nursing student was brutally raped and murdered in campus housing. It took months before there was an arrest, and during that frightening period, Mendieta took it upon herself to create work about the attack, conveying her own horror, as well as drawing attention to the invisible epidemic of violence against women. In the first of these performances, she invited her fellow students to her apartment. When they arrived, the door was ajar. Inside, there was lavish evidence that a horrible crime had been committed. Mendieta was tied to the table, half-naked, her underwear around her ankles. Blood dripped on the floor. The students stayed an hour and for the entire time she didn’t move a muscle.Mendieta was working right at the beginning of second-wave feminism, when it was still possible to believe in the power of revelation, the shock tactics of re-enacting violence as a vaccination, a homeopathic cure. But by the 1990s, Sedgwick was already beginning to wonder whether there wasn’t something weirdly naive about placing faith in this kind of unveiling, “as though to make something visible as a problem were, if not a mere hop, skip, and jump away from getting it solved, at least self-evidently a step in that direction”. As if violence is not titillating to certain appetites as if the expression of pain cannot be consumed with relish.The faith in inoculation remains, of course. In 2017, the actor Elisabeth Moss announced her irritation with people who refused to watch the ultra-violent Handmaid’s Tale, a dystopic fantasy that felt closer by the day. “Really?” she asked. “You don’t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.” But in the age of the internet, it’s very hard to think that anyone needs more evidence of violence. We’re already drenched in it, and its capacity to snap us out of numbness is grossly overstated. If anything, it does the opposite, glutting the viewer with despair.The night before Trump’s inauguration, I saw the trans poet Eileen Myles read their own version of a presidential address at the London Review Bookshop. The vision they unfolded was the utopian inverse – painful! thrilling! – of what Trump would say the following day. Under Myles, the White House would be a homeless shelter, there’d be 24-hour libraries, free trains, free education, free food, archery for everyone sure, why not? It felt reparative, listening to that. It felt like my imaginative ability to frame utopias and then to move purposefully towards them might have been restored, at least for a minute.I had the same experience when I first read Always Coming Home, Ursula Le Guin’s 1985 collection of stories and anthropological fragments about a future civilisation, the Kesh, living in what is now California’s Napa Valley in the wake of an apocalypse that is never quite described. It was a relief to encounter such a formidable thinker using her imaginative energy, her humour and her extensive knowledge to construct a better, fairer, more environmentally sane society – its architecture, sexual arrangements, metaphors, toys, songs, clothes, medical practices and stories – rather than simply magnifying all that is worst about our own.That’s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading The Road or The Death of Grass does not. Le Guin was no less concerned about the oncoming ecological crisis than Cormac McCarthy, but her approach is calmer and more infused with hope. Hope has a bad press in our cynical age, but it doesn’t necessarily mean being disengaged, a Pollyanna blind to the state things are in or uninterested in how they got that way. Hope is the precursor to change. Without it, no better world is possible.The same year that Wojnarowicz was photographed with his needle and thread, the film-maker Derek Jarman began the diary that would become Modern Nature, an account of building his famous garden on the beach in Dungeness, Kent. Jarman was diagnosed HIV-positive in the winter of 1986, years before the invention of combination therapy made long-term survival a probability. In the face of his own oncoming death, he didn’t give way to despair. Instead he elected to spend his time making this stony desert bloom.He planted irises and roses directly into the shingle, encouraging a riot of wallflowers and valerian, “all the dark humours blown away by the wind”. This wild, unfenced arcadia sustained him through the political battles of his final years, and has now outlived him by more than quarter of a century. Last time I visited, in December, it was still humming with power.I have the same feeling when I look at photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans or read a novel by Ali Smith. I had it when I went to see my friend Rich’s degree show at Goldsmiths and he’d made dozens of ceramic razor clams and anemones, downed planes and nubbly coral reefs. It’s a feeling of being inducted back into hope, a restoration of faith. It’s easy to give into despair. There’s so much that’s frightening, so much that’s wrong. But if this virus shows us anything, it’s that we’re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat, even when we can’t touch. Art is a place where that can happen, where ideas and people are made welcome. It’s a zone of enchantment as well as resistance, and it’s open even now .• Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency by Olivia Laing is published on 16 April by Picador (RRP £20).

Her third novel, The Middlesteins, was a New York Times bestseller and she has been described as “the poet laureate of dysfunctional families”. Her new novel, All This Could Be Yours, is an emotionally taut tale exploring the power and toxic influence of a controlling patriarch.Your patriarch, Victor, is a bullying, overbearing narcissist. How much was this novel a response to the current US political landscape?Our bad president is not the first bad man that has ever existed. It was a book I could write now, but I have a long history of writing about men treating women poorly. I didn’t have to dig too deep to think of a bad man character. They’ve been around for a long time.Alex, Victor’s daughter, is desperate for answers about her father’s conduct, but her mother, Barbra, remains tight-lipped. Do you see Barbra as an enabler or a victim?When Trump got elected, I thought about the complicity of white women voting for him. I was interested in exploring that complicity. I see Barbra as an enabler. I was very angry with her at the beginning of the book and I tried to write myself into a place of understanding.Victor’s children worry about being infected by his toxicity. Can children escape the influence of their parents?We have to decide that we want to move on. And we have to decide that we aren’t going to engage in toxic behaviour. But as a society we tend to blame our parents long past the point when we should still be blaming them. We have to take responsibility for our own actions at a certain point. It’s a very western idea that we need closure.The theme of forgiveness runs through the novel. Do you think some things are simply unforgivable?Yes, as long as it doesn’t destroy you. Some people don’t feel comfortable living without forgiving. This book is really about what it’s like when you have to grieve somebody you don’t love. Because you don’t get to choose grief. You don’t get to choose love. There’s so many feelings that you don’t get to choose they just sneak up on you. Alex is grieving a sad, complicated, hard past that she fought her way out of.Your first three books were marketed as women’s fiction and after a change in publisher, you’ve been positioned as literary fiction. Are categorisations helpful to readers or writers?I give a talk called A Career in Book Covers or How I Survived Being a Woman in Publishing. I show all my book covers through the years and talk about how I was put into a box and, finally, with my fourth book, was pulled out of that box. It’s misleading to the audience more than anything, so it’s unfair both to the audience and the author. And it’s cynical on behalf of the publishing world.Did you grow up in a bookish household?My mother was an elementary school teacher. I learned to read aged about three or four off the back of cereal boxes, so I was always reading voraciously and there were plenty of books coming through the house. But it wasn’t an academic household.What were your favourite books as a child?I read a lot of Nancy Drew mysteries. There was a used bookstore near my house and books were a quarter and I used to steal money from my parents’ change jar to buy theme. I remember buying a Joyce Carol Oates collection of short stories when I was 13 or 14 and she was like a role model: reading a woman who was writing contemporary things and who was successful and young.Which writers have most influenced your own writing?I’m a big Grace Paley fan. She’s like my mother ship she’s so good. Reading her was absolute freedom – the freedom to have a voice.And which writers working today do you most admire?I read a lot of poetry because that’s where you get access to really modern ideas. I love Morgan Parker’s and Ada Limón’s poetry.Is there a famous book – classic or contemporary – that you’ve never got around to reading?I haven’t read A Little Life yet. I want to. I heard it was awesome but that it’s really heart-wrenching and I haven’t been in a place where I feel like having my heart wrenched.Which book would you give to a young person?A Complicated Kindness by Miriam Toews, which is about being a young woman in a community that is a complicated place to grow up. Also Esmé Weijun Wang’s The Collected Schizophrenias – she explains a lot about mental illness but it’s written in a youthful, accessible way. And Mary HK Choi has written a couple of young adult novels that are really fun.What book might people be surprised to see on your bookshelves?There should never be any surprises! You should read everything and have a curiosity for the entire world.What’s the book you most like to give to other people?Just Kids by Patti Smith because I know a lot of people who are creative and that’s a great book if you’re having a complicated relationship with your art, and if you’re at a crossroads in your life.Who would you like to write the story of your life?I’m writing a memoir now so it’s got to be me because I wouldn’t wish going through all the banalities of my existence on anyone but myself.• All This Could Be Yours by Jami Attenberg is published by Profile (£14.99).

The retailer also said some stores could have to close temporarily.Arcadia, which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, said it had taken the “difficult decision” to close its more than 500 stores until further notice. The retailer said all staff would receive their normal pay for March “after which we will review this situation and will be keeping our store teams updated”.In a sign of the scale of the slump that retailers now expect, Primark has written to suppliers urging them to “seriously consider putting a halt on all current and future production and the purchasing of any materials in relation to any Primark orders”.“We have been left with no option but to place a hold on any new orders being placed,” the fashion retailer said. Orders already in train were also being reviewed, it said, adding: “It is likely that in most circumstances we will have little option but to terminate those orders pursuant to our contractual rights.”Earlier this week Primark’s parent company, Associated British Foods, said about a fifth of its selling space was already closed. Paul Marchant, the chief executive of Primark, said it could not have foreseen that over the course of a week, stores in every country in which it operated, with the exception of the UK, would have to close.Marchant said: “We have large quantities of existing stock in our stores, our depots and in transit that is paid for and if we do not take this action now we will be taking delivery of stock that we simply can’t sell. This is unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times.” “We recognise and are deeply saddened that this will clearly have an effect throughout our entire supply chain,” Marchant added.The gloomy update came as it emerged that the Debenhams chief executive, Stefaan Vansteenkiste, had written to the department store chain’s suppliers to inform them they would be getting their money a month later than expected.“Unfortunately, we have to ask you for extra support,” wrote Vansteenkiste. “We will be extending all supplier payment terms by 30 days – except in those cases where we are already on extended terms. This decision is crucial to make sure we can ultimately pay the outstanding payable balances we have with you.”Debenhams had already asked landlords for a five-month rent holiday as it faces “unprecedented pressures” because of the pandemic. The department store, which has closed 22 branches in recent months and is set to close 28 more next year, was struggling even before the virus hit.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.M\u0026ampS said it had served customers “without cease through two world wars” but the Covid-19 outbreak meant it anticipated the performance of its clothing and homewares departments – where sales were already falling – would worsen. It was seeing substantial declines in these departments and has redeployed many staff to support its food retail business amid a run on supermarkets by panicked shoppers.With demand for its spring and summer ranges expected to be weak, M\u0026ampS has ditched plans to order £100m worth of goods so as to avoid being left with a glut of stock. As Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, put it this week: “People do not buy a new outfit to stay at home.”Unlike high street rivals such as Next and Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group – which on Friday issued a profit warning and announced plans to close five Jack Wills stores – M\u0026ampS is expected to be among a handful of “essential” retailers alongside supermarkets and pharmacists permitted to keep shops open throughout the crisis.M\u0026ampS said its food halls were busier than usual but its bias towards selling chilled and fresh food (which have a short shelf life) meant it had not experienced the same huge sales uplifts experienced by the major grocers.M\u0026ampS said scrapping the idend would save £130m as it warned profits for the year to the end of March could fall short of the £440m pencilled in by analysts. The government’s decision to suspend business rates would also save it about £180m.In further evidence of the tough outlook faced by retailers, Hotel Chocolat said the virus signalled the closure of some or all of its 125 UK stores. Greg Lawless, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “The UK retail sector is facing a storm of reduced footfall to the high street, particularly for the general retail sector. Nobody knows how long normal lives will have restrictions in place – so the impact on financial forecasts is unknown.”“Cash preservation is the new priority,” added Lawless. “Those companies that adapt quickly and do the right thing will survive but we are in uncharted territory.”In other developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/351515c8842614fb6e399c33f19d23b5b24bcd9e/243_0_2499_1500/master/2499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c1daccbaec874224309d8fd2d208dad","title":"cats laughter coronavirus pop stars","story":"Laughter is the best medicine, people used to say, which is handy, now that you can’t get a Panadol for love nor money. Unlike useful household medications, I’m taking laughter where I can get it. Highlights have included countless pop stars, from JoJo to Muna, rewriting the lyrics to their most famous tunes to tell people to stay at home the fact that Cardi B shouting “Coronavirus! Coronavirus!” has now been remixed into an actual song and, of course, the dedicated efforts of Dame Judi Dench. Her daughter, Finty Williams, posted “a message from ma”, a video of the star of stage and screen wearing a hat in the shape of a dog (a cat would have been apt, but more in a minute). Dench pulls up its ears. “Oh! There you are,” she says. The ears flop. “Just keep laughing. That’s all we can do.”Dench is also inadvertently leading one of the strangest plot twists in recent movie history: Cats is finding a captive audience. Granted, that audience is particularly captive right now, but the film, widely derided as one of the most disastrous ever made is, miraculously, coming into its own. Last week, it won six Razzies, or Golden Raspberry awards, including the not-coveted worst picture and worst director gongs. Dench sadly lost out to Rebel Wilson for worst supporting actress, which Wilson won for her Jennyanydots performance. Dench was thrilled to be nominated, as she told Radio 4’s Front Row, but admitted that she hadn’t read anything about the reaction to the film, nor actually seen it, either.Seth Rogen, however, has seen Cats. The actor got “pretty stoned” last week, and live-tweeted his reaction to his first viewing of the film. “It is truly trippy,” Rogen began. “Am I supposed to know what a Jellicle is? They’ve said it 200,000 times but I don’t know what’s happening haha.” He went on to make several pertinent observations, including this one, which really makes you think: “Judi Dench is in a cat fur coat which I can only assume is socially appalling in this world.”Perhaps it’s the terrifying uncertainty of the day-to-day, or perhaps it’s Rogen’s delightfully delighted reaction to it, but Cats is starting to look like the movie we never knew we needed to spice up our quarantines. In the US, people are group watching it via video chat and entertainment sites are staging watch-alongs. The fact that the UK has to wait for a stream of it is making me consider starting a change.org petition. Move it forward, for the good of the nation!By now, Gal Gadot’s celebrity singalong to John Lennon’s Imagine has been widely shared and enjoyed, if by enjoyed you mean watching it as if watching Cats, before all of this happened. I appreciate the eagerness of celebrities to cheer us up, even if her assembled crew of actors and comedians has been mocked, particularly in Britain where we seem to have been vaccinated against sincerity. I watched it after the fnar-fnarring died down and, look, it has its merits. This is a great time for those who love to nose around other people’s houses, and the video proves to be a leveller in that it plays out exactly like any other karaoke.Remember karaoke? Like TikTok, but when human contact was still a thing – this follows the same pattern. Gadot set the bar firmly in the middle. She can clearly sing but doesn’t belt it out. She does a nice job, then passes the baton. Her friends sing their lines with middling commitment. Some almost talk it, a great way to disguise tone-deafness, some give it moderate gusto, and then Sia comes along. Sia annihilates the competition by approaching it as she does the chorus from her song Chandelier, which has several thousand notes. She leaves you thinking, can I just see the Sia-only edit, please? Sia is here to support us, not to play.The other best thing about the singalong is that my personal hero, Joe Lycett – or is he still called Hugo Boss? – has made his own version in which comedians say “bastard” as often as they can. Without the Gadot initiative, would this Bastard version exist? Truly, she is Wonder Woman.For anyone else watching the prime minister’s befuddling daily news briefings in a similar state of forehead-pummelling despair, wondering exactly when Boris Johnson is going to stop looking like he is both mildly amused by this ersion and a bit bloody put out at the drain on his bloody time, Gareth Southgate’s letter to England supporters is so emphatic in its leadership and generosity that you can only daydream of a fantasy future in which he is standing at the podium at 5pm every day, in a waistcoat.In the letter, which left me with a little something in my eye, not that I touched it, Southgate addresses every pressing concern. He expresses sympathy towards those who have already lost loved ones, he emphasises our collective responsibility and he directs our attentions to where they are most needed.“Now is clearly not the moment for us to take centre stage,” he writes. “The heroes will be the men and women who continue working tirelessly in our hospitals and medical centres to look after our friends and families.” He adds that when England players return to the pitch, “I will never have been prouder to be leader”. This is what leadership looks like."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e235517037996cf658ee0d130356ce379382e8/0_115_4057_2435/master/4057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=181ecf24e6dcd4d8bf03a2e4a51e1b5b","title":"smartphones could help track coronavirus but at what cost","story":"It’s wise to be wary of the government adopting intrusive apps that monitor the effectiveness of public health measuresDraconian countermeasures are being implemented all over the place. If the pandemic dissipates – for whatever reason – such extreme short-term measures may be bearable. But what if the thing just keeps going? And how can policymakers know they’re doing more good than harm?A key principle of control engineering is that you have to be able to measure the variable you’re trying to control. In the case of Covid-19, we currently have no way of accurately measuring how we’re doing, because we’re not able to do enough testing of the population. Dammit, we’re still not even testing frontline medical staff.I know, I know: this is hard this thing came out of the blue we can’t just magic up the resources needed to do extensive public testing out of thin air etc. But at the same time, every sentient being in the government must know by now that we must find some way of measuring the thing we’re trying to control. How else will we know – other than by counting the number of desperate cases who show up needing intensive care – whether that curve is being flattened or not?We need a magic bullet. And, miraculously, we seem to have one. It’s called a smartphone. Almost everybody has one nowadays. And – as security agencies, internet companies and mobile network owners know – these devices track your every movement, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. They’re a bit like those electronic tags we put on some criminals to make sure they stick to the terms of their parole conditions. Except that the phones are smarter than tags. We can run apps on them that make them serve our public health purposes.Interestingly, we were doing this in the UK way back in 2011 – in the “FluPhone” project, run by Prof Jon Crowcroft and Dr Eiko Yoneki of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory. They created an app that monitored flu-like symptoms by questioning the phones’ owners and then subsequently logged their physical proximity to other people they met. The pilot study, conducted by volunteers over a few months – which in an odd twist of fate coincided with the outbreak of swine flu – demonstrated convincingly how smartphones can provide data that would otherwise be unavailable to public health authorities.So, in a way, this approach to monitoring behaviour during an epidemic is old hat, technically speaking. Not surprisingly, the Covid-19 crisis has led people in a number of countries to develop similar tools. In early February, for example, South Korean geeks wrote “Corona 100m”, an app that allows people to see the date a coronavirus patient was confirmed to have the disease, along with that patient’s nationality, gender, age and the places the patient visited. The person using the app can also see how close they are to coronavirus patients. It was launched on 11 February and had a million downloads in the first 17 days.It looks as though the Chinese authorities have been using similar approaches almost from the outset of the pandemic. And the Israeli government authorised the country’s internal security agency to use mobile phone location data to help combat the virus. According to a New York Times report, the data will be used to retrace the movements of iniduals who test positive for the virus, and identify others who should be quarantined. And I bet there are people in 10 Downing Street (and not just Dominic Cummings) who are actively thinking along those lines.You can now see the quandary heading our way. We have a terrifying emergency on our hands. There’s a technology that could be really useful in providing a real-time measure of the effectiveness (or otherwise) of public policy. But it’s so intrusive that in “normal” times we would be very hesitant to adopt it. Present times are not normal, though, so we will probably adopt it – perhaps sensibly – “just for the duration of the crisis”. And then?You know the answer because we’ve been here before – with 911. That emergency led a panicked US into building the surveillance state that Edward Snowden eventually exposed in 2013. Once a government commits to this stuff, it seems that there’s no going back.

And of course, the giant cruise ships have disappeared.”Under Venice’s strict rules of self-confinement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus – all journeys but a trip to walk the dog or buy food are forbidden – the ancient city has been transformed almost overnight.La Serenissima’s hundreds of canals have been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis, transport and tourist boats. The chugging vaporetti water buses now run on a reduced timetable. Even most of the gondolas are moored.The clarity of the water has improved dramatically. Cormorants have returned to e for fish they can now see. At the Piazzale Roma vaporetto stop, ducks have even made a nest. “Someone has put up a sign saying, ‘Don’t tread on the duck eggs,’’” Beggiato said. “All totally unimaginable a while ago.”As the death toll from coronavirus in Italy outstrips that of China, the government of Giuseppe Conte has tried to keep citizens at home using a mix of social media and police controls.But locals are still moving about cautiously to do their daily shopping – except now in a city without visitors. It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw protests against overtourism under the No Grande Navi (“No more cruise ships”) slogan.At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance.In a queue to buy fish, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: “When I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.”“For the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?” said Franco Folin, a fisherman. “But when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited – there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.”The apparent cleanliness of the water is not in fact due to a lack of pollution, said Davide Tagliapetra, an environmental researcher at the Institute of Marine Science. He told a local TV station that the reason is the absence of motorised transport, which normally churns up the muddy canal floor.Matteo Bisol runs the vineyard restaurant Venissa on the tiny lagoon island of Mazzorbo, and has been campaigning for a more eco-responsible, sustainable model of tourism in Venice for some time.“For goodness sake, it is not surprising there are fish in the canals of Venice,” he said. “If there were not, then we should all be worried as the lagoon here is a fragile ecosystem. People need to realise that if we control and cut down boat traffic in Venice and its lagoon then we could all discover a unique biosphere.”It is not just the cruise ships that are gone: the souvenir stalls that line the Riva degli Schiavoni, the Murano glass and lace shops, and the bars and restaurants are all closed.It is a brutal hit to an economy that relies on tourism, but in the meantime locals appear to be rediscovering their city, in an admittedly constrained way.“We Venetians have the feeling that nature has returned and is taking back possession of the city,” said Beggiato.“If you ask me today – sunny blue skies, clear canals – then, yes, we would all like Venice to stay like this for a while. But we need, and look forward to, the return of tourists, though maybe not the 20 million a year that we have had to cope with.“I honestly believe we should take the opportunity of this lockdown to reflect and see how we can be more organised in the future to find a balance between the city and tourism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7709a8bb32e389a3185d900d4bbc3760f50c74e/0_33_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a973210e0d231d51816261b2eabf712d","title":"rare andean bears flock to cloud forest to feast on wild avocados aoe","story":"The real-life Paddington bears were in decline across South America, but records suggest their numbers are growing in EcuadorDeep in the Maquipucuna cloud forest, two hours drive from Ecuador’s capital, Quito, rare Andean bears come together for a few weeks each year to feast on the wild avocados ripening atop mist-shrouded trees.According to ecologists, this small community is growing, bucking the trend of a vulnerable species in decline across South America. The gathering, similar to those of grizzly bears at salmon rivers in Alaska and Canada, is turning what experts know about this normally reclusive, solitary creature on its head.“Throughout the Andes, because of habitat loss, we would expect to see a population in decline,” said Rebeca Justicia, a conservationist and co-founder of the Maquipucuna Foundation and reserve. “But locally we have seen a spike in the population. We are even seeing mothers with cubs, which is very unusual.”There are believed to be fewer than 10,000 of these bears left across the northern Andes. Listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature red list, they face an increasingly uncertain future due to habitat destruction and hunting.Justicia set up the Maquipucuna Foundation with her husband, Rodrigo Ontaneda, 30 years ago. They were instrumental in persuading many local communities to stop ranching and timber farming and lobbied for protection of the wider Chocó-Andino Pichincha region, which was finally declared a Unesco biosphere reserve in 2018.“When we started our project, it was very hard to see a bear,” said Justicia. “We heard, anecdotally, there were bears here and that people hunted them.”Andean or spectacled bears, which have earned global attention thanks to the fictional Paddington Bear, are hunted for parts used in the international wildlife trade – gall bladders, used in oriental medicine, can fetch as much as $150 (£116) and there is a large market in Ecuador for bear paws.Justicia spotted her first Andean bear in 2008. Since then, she says, she has recorded 40 different bears, based on photographs taken in the 6,500-hectare (16,061-acre) Maquipucuna reserve, identifying iniduals from unique facial markings. Other experts have counted up to 19 bears in the forest in a single year.“We see an unusually high number of bears during the wild avocado season because they congregate around this abundant source of food,” said Justicia. “The small avocados have very large quantities of fat and oil and that is hard to get in a vegetarian diet. They can come and feed for weeks.”Little is known about these creatures. Their chosen territory, in dense cloud forest and the high Andes, the fact they may cover up to 10km in a single day, as well as their timid and solitary natures, makes them difficult to study.But the bear gatherings are helping ecologists understand more about them. Two Andean bears from Maquipucuna, filmed in 2017, were recently featured in BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet series, climbing trees to get at the fruit.“Generally, all bears are solitary,” said Justicia. “The first year we realised this place was different was in 2008. The next year, it went crazy, we saw females with cubs. One February we realised how many bears came together and we began to record them.”Each Andean bear needs around 1,000 hectares of territory, so the reserve itself would only support six iniduals.Justicia compares the gatherings to those of Alaskan grizzlies that come together at salmon rivers. The bears arrive in the dry months, from September to December, but it is unpredictable, because the avocados do not ripen at the same time every year.“We still don’t know how the bears decided to come to Maquipucuna,” said Justicia. “But we are learning more and more every year.”Santiago Molina, a bear expert from San Francisco University of Quito, has carried out his own study of bear numbers in a 65,000-hectare region within the metropolitan district of Quito. His analysis of camera traps has led to an estimate of around 65 bears in the entire region, an area including Maquipucuna but 10 times the size. Molina is sceptical of the numbers recorded by Justicia, although he recorded 19 bears in the reserve in one season in 2009 and said 15 were spotted within two months in 2017 inside the reserve boundaries.He is both excited and worried about the rising numbers of what he describes as “Quito’s bears”. The proximity to human populations brings its own dangers.“This is new,” said Molina, whose work led to the creation of the Andean Bear Corridor, or Corredor del Oso Andino, by the Quito government to protect the bears’ habitat. “It is changing the whole concept of bears. Five years ago, people did not believe there were bears in this area, in the Quito corridor. Before, the bears we studied were in the highlands, the grasslands, not forests, and bears were known to be solitary animals.”Those bears living in the forest exhibit different behaviour from highland bears, he said. They are known to hunt, dispelling the myth they are mostly vegetarian.“I have video of a bear hunting a deer – that was a myth for years,” said Molina. “I suspect most of the bears living here have already tasted meat, from feeding on meat left around, for instance when a cow dies. Bears have good scents and are very opportunistic.”“Now we hear of bear-human conflicts. It is a population under threat,” he added.He is starting a project in the Yunguilla community, with the international association for bear research and management, to help farmers reduce the chance of bears coming into contact with their cattle and crops.“We have an opportunity to address this. If we don’t do that we are going to lose the population in the forest.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a8567a0ad0b5e94ec951846e222da77d3ebd4d/0_0_3500_2324/master/3500.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58aa6bbe3a8f2a0de6cbfa60445aa91a 880w","title":"shades of 50 how the midlife woman went from invisible to the main event","story":"From Jennifer Aniston to Robin Wright, the cultural underdog has been rebrandedAt the end of the Versace show in Milan last September, Jennifer Lopez burst on to the catwalk in a blaze of glory. Chin proud, shoulders back, her vibe was somewhere between a bride making her church entrance and a cowboy kicking open the doors of a saloon bar. Split to the waist, the panels of her jungle-green dress floated on her slipstream as she sailed through the firefly cloud of camera phones. Her dress, with its navel-deep plunge, was That Dress – the one she had worn to the Grammys two decades earlier, the one that famously inspired the creation of Google Images. A pop culture goddess was reincarnated, shortly after her 50th birthday, and I whooped and clapped and joined in the confetti shower of fire emoji and heart-eyes raining down around me.I am four years younger than Lopez. I harbour no catwalk ambitions whatsoever – the thought of that is making me chuckle gently to myself in my low-key, middle-aged way as I write – but I felt something joyous in Lopez owning that runway. Along with every other forty- or fiftysomething woman watching, in the room or on Instagram, it felt that I was in some way cheering for my team.Cultural underdogs since for ever, midlife women are suddenly scene-stealers. At Paris fashion week last month, Helena Christensen (51) starred in the Balmain show, while Yolanda Hadid (56) joined her daughters Bella and Gigi on the catwalk at Off-White. When Jennifer Aniston appeared on the cover of Interview magazine for her 51st birthday, it was her bottom-half pairing of over-the-knee Celine leather boots and Alaïa knickers that made headlines, rather than anything she said. Last month, Lopez joined forces with Shakira – a mere baby at 43 – for a Super Bowl performance that ripped up the rulebook about what an on-stage duet looks like at their age. Instead of matronly gowns, sturdy chignons and stately ballad-singing, think peephole leathers and choreography involving poles and hair-whips.There are structural reasons why the sands are shifting. As life expectancy increases, the meta-timetable that governs our lives requires redrafting. We are getting married later, having children later, so it is logical we tip into middle age later. No point rushing through life’s journeys and then twiddling your thumbs at the departure gate, as it were. There are practical reasons, too, why a swelling older population should stay fit and productive. Generations Y and Z have enough on their plates without being expected to foot the bill for half-centuries of feet-up retirement.But this is not just about 50 being the new 40, an extra decade of (relative) youth tacked on to our lives like a side-return extension. When Gloria Steinem fired off her famous riposte, telling an interviewer who complimented her on not looking her age that “this is what 40 looks like”, it seemed then that the way she looked was a reflection of her spirit. Steinem was talking about how she carried herself, her body language, the clothes she wore, her choice of hairstyle – not just her skin texture or jean size. Meanwhile the modern rebranding of 50 is really all about the visual element: the smooth skin, taut abs, being able to wear the same revealing dress you wore two decades earlier.Which is why, somewhere between J-Lo’s Versace plunge and Aniston’s Alaïa knickers, I started to wonder. Was I falling a teeny bit out of love with midlife’s new look? There are only so many times you can hear the word “empowering” used about somebody’s abs before it starts to niggle. What’s more, I can’t help noticing that the world has begun championing midlife women at the precise moment when advances in cosmetic surgery, skincare science and “tweakments”, alongside a boom in the diet and fitness industries, means that it is possible – with enough money, and knowhow, and leisure time – to spend your way out of the visible ageing process, the same way you could once spend your way to having a Hermès Birkin. Call me an old cynic, but I’m not sure that this is entirely a coincidence.The fashion industry has been central to this rebranding of midlife. Donatella Versace has been the silent partner in Lopez’s half-century renaissance: remaking the iconic dress, casting her in September’s Versace show, creating a bespoke layered wardrobe for her Super Bowl performance. For the Interview magazine shoot, Aniston wore a bra top – and not just any bra top, but the Givenchy pink satin number worn in the catwalk show by Kaia Gerber, the 18-year-old supermodel daughter of Cindy Crawford. At the Golden Globes in January, Gwyneth Paltrow, 47, wore a Fendi dress the density of a single sheet of tissue paper, the herringbone lines of her external oblique muscles clearly visible on either side of her torso.A new, aspirational version of midlife is a powerful marketing tool to win a lucrative customer base of older women with money to spend on becoming the best versions of themselves – whatever that means. Long gone are the days when a cameo by an ex-supermodel was a novelty at fashion week: these days, the catwalks are packed with more lithe fortysomethings than a £25 north London yoga class. When Meryl Streep was featured on the cover of Vogue, aged 62, in 2011, she was the oldest woman to do so that record has since been broken several times, most recently by Lauren Hutton, who was nearly 74 when she made the cover of Vogue Italia in 2017. In 2012, a New York Times article about the rise of the older model quoted a casting agent who dismissed it as “just a fad”, but this has been proved wrong. The “sophisticated” ision of Wilhelmina Models in New York, a spokeswoman recently told the LA Times, is the company’s fastest growing area.The omerta around cosmetic surgery, and to a lesser degree Botox and fillers – or “sprinkles” as the latter two are known on the front row – cannot disguise the fact that the faces of many prominent midlifers are strikingly unlined and gravity-defying. The only person worth quoting on the topic, in my view, is 53-year-old actor Robin Wright, who, when asked whether she had tried Botox, told an interviewer, “You bet. Everybody fucking does it! I suppose I can’t say ‘everybody’ because I don’t know for sure, but come on!”Interestingly, while any lines deeper than the lightest etching of crow’s feet have been all but eliminated from public-facing midlife, silver hair has come into vogue. Finally, the silver fox has gone gender neutral. Sharon Osbourne recently swapped her trademark crimson for an elegant Miranda Priestly platinum. Erin O’Connor walked the Tommy Hilfiger show at London fashion week with her once-raven hair now salt-and-pepper. Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, Zosia Mamet and Cara Delevingne have all experimented with silver.In other words, this is not as simple as letting your roots grow out. Cheering though it is to see silver hair celebrated, note that it is sleek and salon-glossed, not flecked or wiry. (Jack Martin, the colourist who created Osborne’s new look, and who was responsible for 82-year-old Jane Fonda debuting her silver hair at this year’s Oscars, has become the silver-fox guru, booked solid for months.) As with so many aspects of the new-look midlife, this kind of silver hair requires a considerable outlay of time and money, and a rigorous schedule of upkeep. This is all part of the package: a disciplined routine of 10-step beauty regimes, daily workouts and rolling beauty appointments. It’s enough to make you pine for the prospect of being allowed to let yourself go.But optics are always about more than appearance. In my more churlish moods, the rebranding of midlife grates as a cheap trick to convince women to spend even more of our lives obsessing over our thighs. And that ageing is an embarrassing problem, one we can solve by throwing money at it. And still, there is a deep and true joy to be felt in a Lopez or Aniston showing what 50 can look like – because in our visually oriented culture, what 50 looks like is a statement about what 50 can be: relevant, fabulous, top-of-your-game. As the silver-haired, sexagenarian swimsuit model Yazemeenah Rossi told the Observer: “I may be a certain age, but I have a sexy look. Sexy means alive. I’m alive!”The new-look midlife goddess is a powerful totem. I will bow down in worship, even if I don’t entirely believe in it.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fdb148584ea50762b30104d1ace1af5679580f/0_50_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f39813a4adb32aa2e66a6128be68d210","title":"chelsea v leeds united 1970 fa cup final replay live","story":"Our new twice-weekly retro MBM feature begins with one of the most notorious FA Cup finals of all time. Ding ding!So after a 65-year wait, Chelsea have finally won the FA Cup! Congratulations to them, and commiserations to Leeds, for whom a 51-year quest goes on. Thanks for reading this retro As It Happened minute-by-minute report comments are open below for your leisure and pleasure. Fingers crossed that the knee injury suffered by Peter Bonetti (he’ll have treatment tomorrow) won’t keep him out of the World Cup in Mexico, eh readers?Please join us again on Tuesday evening at 7.45pm GMT for Rob Smyth’s blow-by-blow account of the Euro 96 semi betweenEric Todd’s match report has landed. Here’s how it looks.By way of contrast, here’s the delighted winning manager Dave Sexton! “I am very happy and very proud. We didn’t get in the game in a footballing sense for a long time, but we held on as we did at Wembley. I am sure the trouble was nerves, but towards the end we began to show our worth and I thought we were value for our win. We return on the 10 o’clock train tomorrow and should be at the station at 12.40pm. I hope quite a number of people will be interested.” Chelsea fans: be sure to get down to Euston to welcome home your returning heroes, y’all.Poor Don Revie, his hopes punctured for the third and final time at the end of an epic season of missed opportunity, is a study in misery and frustration. “I’m very sick and very disappointed. Here we are at the end of a hard season without anything to show for it. I’m sorry for my players more than for myself. They’re all absolutely dejected. You must be after going so close in three major tournaments. But they’ve got great character and they’ll be back on top next season.” He’s convinced his team should have had a penalty for McCreadie’s high-kick on Bremner. “It must have been a penalty. Billy was going for the ball with his head and was kicked on the back of the head, so I don’t see how it could have been anything else but dangerous kicking and a penalty for us. But I can’t take anything away from Chelsea. They came back very well.”Baldwin and McCreadie take a handle each and romp down towards the Stretford End. Chelsea fans bob up and down in sequence, their scarves forming a rolling blue-and-white river, the banks momentarily threatening to burst over the advertising hoardings. But it all calms down quickly enough. A constant white noise of celebration rustles around Old Trafford. These are such glorious scenes! Chelsea romp along the touchline on their lap of honour. As they reach the opposite end of the stadium, where some Leeds fans remain, hero-of-the-hour Webb shrugs his shoulders, palms pointing upwards, and shakes his head theatrically. Sorry, guys, I had to do it!Chelsea captain Ron Harris goes up to receive the cup, star keeper Peter Bonetti the base. Harris raises the shiny prize with palpable glee. A total lack of pomp and ceremony, and the moment’s so much more moving for it. Cheers of joy ring around Old Trafford. Imagine if all this sensational fan-generated emotion was being drowned out by loud music! Just imagine. Hutchinson, wearing Hunter’s white Leeds shirt, does the trying-on-lid-as-hat thing. It fits, as it always does in these situations. Looks good on him, too.CHELSEA HAVE WON THE 1970 FA CUP!!! Three peeps of the referee’s pea, and that’s it! Webb and Harris embrace. Clarke gets caught up awkwardly in the middle, but offers friendly congratulations nonetheless. Chelsea have finally done it ... but Leeds United’s wait goes on. After a hell of a battle, all’s fair in love and war, and there are plenty of handshakes and swapped shirts. Joyous scenes for Chelsea a bitter denouement to the season for their opponents.ET 30 min +1: The last chance for Leeds, as Gray meets a poor Dempsey clearing header, but blooters his volley miles over the bar.ET 30 min: Cooke dances up and down the right in a marvellous display of efficient clock management. Hunter gives him a kick for his trouble ... but then the pair exchange a wink and a smile. A lovely warm sporting moment at the end of a fractious affair.ET 29 min: Gray floats one into the mixer from deep. It’s easy for Bonetti. Leeds are pressing and pressing, but to no avail. Giles tries a shot from 20 yards but it’s blocked at source. Leeds fully desperate now.ET 28 min: Jones and Bremner combine down the inside-left channel and force a corner. Charlton hangs about on the goalline. The normally reliable Giles hooks the set piece straight over the bar. Charlton is beyond furious, exploring new realms of anger.ET 27 min: Chelease take their own sweet time over the goal kick. Meanwhile Rob Ainsley is back, and his grandpa isn’t happy. “Grumbling from grandad about Leeds being ‘complacent’, a word I’m intrigued to learn. I’ve only been half-watching to be honest, but being nine years old, it’s been a good excuse to stay up late. I must remember to write about tonight in my Penguin diary so that when I’m grown up I can remember what I was doing.”ET 26 min: It’s a free kick to Leeds, won by Lorimer down the left. It’s taken quickly and Lorimer sends a dismal effort dribbling well wide left. What a waste. Leeds lost their cool just as they needed to keep their heads.ET 25 min: From a throw deep in Chelsea territory, Lorimer finds some space on the byline to the left of goal. Hollins is forced to head his low cross behind for a corner. Before the set piece can be taken, Webb slyly kicks the ball further behind the goal to waste a little bit of time. The corner is only half cleared by Cooke. Gray - who has been awfully quiet since being whacked towards the end of the first half - shoots from the left of the D. Clarke flicks it towards the bottom left, and it’s heading in, but Webb hacks clear marvellously!ET 24 min: Webb slides in on Cooper. Had he connected, Cooper’s bones were clattering back over the Pennines to the sound of a fast xylophone trill. Fortunately for all involved, Webb was so spectacularly late, he missed the player altogether, by several yards and seconds to boot. On an evening of wild challenges, that was by far the silliest.ET 23 min: Hinton replaces Osgood, a defensive move by Chelsea. So much for attack being the best form of defence. The sub was made without ceremony blink and you’d have missed it. No histrionics from the sacrificed Osgood, who has been instrumental in Chelsea’s turnaround but takes to the bench, a fine evening’s work complete.ET 22 min:  On the touchline, Sexton prepares to send on Hinton. Leeds launch a rare attack, but once again Bremner ties himself in knots on the edge of the Chelsea box. “I’m wearing my original blue Umbro shirt with badge and number sown on by my mum,” announces young Chris Taylor proudly. “My brother being older had first choice and picked Osgood (9). My second choice was Hutchinson (10) but I wasn’t allowed two numbers and so I finally settled for Hollins (4) who has had an impact tonight. Oh happy days, with people throwing bog rolls at each other just for the fun of it!”ET 21 min: Hollins crosses for Hutchinson, who can’t plant a head on it, ten yards out. Chelsea have clearly decided that attack is the best way to defend their lead. And it’s working. They’re utterly bossing proceedings now.ET 20 min: Osgood sashays down the left nonchalantly. He’s been superb. He lays off to Cooke, who in turn finds Houseman down the wing. Houseman crosses for Hutchinson, who pops ahead of Harvey at the near post and nearly rounds him. But the flag goes up for offside again. Had Hutchinson been blessed with a more patient disposition, this final would surely be over.ET 19 min: Chelsea find the net again! But this one won’t count. Osgood runs the length of the pitch, a straight-line dribble down the middle. Leeds are light at the back, Charlton out of position having been thrown up front. Only Madeley and Hunter are on point. Osgood drifts a little to the left, drawing Madeley and slipping a diagonal pass between the split defenders to Hutchinson, who taps home. But Hutchinson had carelessly drifted offside, way too eager, and the flag correctly pops up, fluttering in the breeze. Hutchinson explodes into a fit of wild rage, and briefly tries to start a barney with Harvey, but really, he’s only cross with himself for going off too early. That should have set the seal on it.ET 18 min: “We’re gonna win the cup!” Now it’s Chelsea’s turn to rattle the rafters. This second period of extra time hasn’t really got going yet. Chelsea won’t care a jot. They’re just over ten minutes away. In the dugout, Revie looks on nervously. Is it to be more extra-time pain after their last-gasp defeat to Liverpool in the final of 1965?ET 17 min: The Stretford End sways with Chelsea blue and white. Strange times we’re living in.And we’re off again! After a very quick turnaround, Chelsea restart the match. They’re 15 minutes away from their first FA Cup! Leeds go on the immediate hunt in search of an equaliser, but Bremner’s hustle on the edge of the box results in a free kick to Chelsea. He considers starting an argument, but thinks better of it.And that’s the end of the first 15 extra minutes. Leeds are in danger of suffering treble heartbreak. Chelsea are so close to only the third piece of major silverware in their history, after the 1954-55 First Division championship and the League Cup won ten years later!ET 15 min: That was as simple as it comes. Leeds hadn’t switched back on since the injury restart. Bremner tries to raise his team with a sortie down the inside right. Cooke dangles out a leg. Bremner goes over it, then springs up and switches into Radge Mode. The situation’s easily defused, though. From the free kick, there’s an almighty scramble in the box, Jones the epicentre of the blast, but Chelsea hack clear.Hutchinson flings long. Super long! The ball drops towards Osgood, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. He flicks on, beating Charlton in the jump. At the far post, Webb rises over Gray and Lorimer and rams a header into the net from close range! Chelsea are in the lead for the first time in this entire tie. Webb runs and punches the air in delight. Chelsea are 16 minutes away from glory!ET 14 min: Osgood is down on the turf too, taking a breather as Hunter continues to receive treatment. And then, from the restart, Leeds lose all momentum, perhaps fatally so. A Hutchinson long throw from the left, intended for Houseman, is headed out by Charlton. Hutchinson tries again, and this time ...ET 13 min: Hunter is in the wars again, having been clattered from behind by Houseman. No foul, naturally. Once again, the cramp sets in, and on trots Les with his Stylo Matchmakers selection.ET 12 min: And now Chelsea come close! Houseman barges in from the left and curls a ball over the Leeds back line. It drops to Osgood on the penalty spot. He takes a touch to his left to get Cooper out of the road, but then blazes wildly over. Such a good opportunity squandered. Gaps are suddenly appearing at each end, though. And no wonder: Hunter is down with cramp, while Charlton is rubbing the leg injured towards the end of regulation time.ET 10 min: Cooper dances down the inside-left channel and is unceremoniously upended by Baldwin. Giles curls the free kick to the far post. Dempsey and Harris ping-ping clearing headers, but the ball drops to Lorimer, just to the right of the D. He flicks the ball up a little before meeting it as it drops, sending a rising whipcracker towards the top right. Bonetti does extremely well to read the danger, get across, parry, then gather. Lorimer’s exquisite skill so close to giving Leeds the lead in this final for the fourth time!ET 9 min: Cooke runs the ball straight out of play on the right. This has been a great replay, just as the final itself was gripping from start to finish, but extra time is a hard watch right now. Both defences are well on top, neither team seems willing to commit too many men into attack. So close yet so far, with so much to lose.ET 7 min: Giles slips Hunter away down the left, but the big defender can only shank a cross onto the top of the goal net. This is all a bit scrappy since the restart, both sides beginning to tire after putting in so much effort on another appalling pitch. Not sure they’d risk holding the Horse of the Year show on this.ET 5 min: Giles has a go from distance this time, but his left-foot dribbler from 25 yards is easy meat for Bonetti, cut-up turf notwithstanding.ET 4 min: Giles considers shooting from 25 yards, but elects to float a pass towards Lorimer down the inside right instead. Wrong decision Lorimer is caught well offside.ET 3 min: Baldwin crosses from the right. Osgood rises high at the far post but is denied by Harvey. The pair tangle in not particularly friendly fashion as they fall in a heap, but, somewhat surprisingly given what’s gone previously, it doesn’t rapidly escalate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b92e01bf9bad0ed476798acc8f567fa23a4b1ed6/2_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c8ecf539cc2705d89fb148e9ee4702","title":"plague inc pandemic gaming coronavirus animal crossing horizon","story":"Our critic’s new weekly slot recommends games for seasoned players and beginners alike. This week, a virus strategy game banned by ChinaAnyone who has continued to play video games beyond childhood is used to the name-calling. Yes, in 2020, millions of thoughtful, otherwise usefully employed people enjoy video games (as well as a fair few thoughtless wastrels too, if Twitter is anything to go by). But away from the golf course or bridge club, adult play is still viewed, culturally speaking, with suspicion, pity or disdain. As a reporter for the Washington Post tweeted in 2017, in reference to the American chatshow host Jimmy Fallon, a keen fan of the medium: “At the heart of any banality is an adult male who plays video games.”Still, personally speaking, it took a pandemic to appreciate that the video game reviewer is truly the cockroach of arts and entertainment criticism. As cinemas, theatres, restaurants and concert venues close, and their remaining staff begin the sorrowful work of disinfection and grant application, writers who cover their industries are forced to glumly twirl their pens, waiting. The video game critic (and, breathe easy, the literary critic), by contrast, suddenly finds a near-captive audience that is, once Netflix has been plundered at least, just maybe willing to give video games a try.For the next who-knows-how-long, this monthly look at the medium will move to a weekly slot. For those readers who consider games to be at the “heart of any banality” (yikes), I can only apologise. But, for those with an open mind, there are worthwhile jewels in the sphere of interactive play. As well as taking a look at the latest releases, I’ll recommend classic works in related genres, essentials to help the inquisitive newcomer understand a medium that, in lieu of its own version of Penguin Classics or the Criterion Collection, has been mournfully lax at honouring and celebrating its past.What better place to start than with Plague Inc., a game for smartphones, tablets, PCs and consoles in which you must create, develop and spread a deadly pathogen while trying to eradicate humanity? Your task is to evolve the virus in ways that hasten its spread across countries and continents, while simultaneously eluding the efforts of the scientific community as they work to produce a vaccine. You watch as a map of the world lights up with pinpricks of infection, while its AI-controlled governments begin to down flights, close ports and enforce quarantines.Playing the game within the context of an actual pandemic is, on some level, a blackly comic endeavour, but Plague Inc. has been highlighted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (which the game’s creator, James Vaughan, visited while developing it) as a valuable tool to “teach the public about outbreaks and disease transmission”. If nothing else, it reassuringly demonstrates, via simulation, the resilience of our species, even to a pathogen many times more deadly than coronavirus.In recent weeks, Plague Inc., which has been downloaded more than 85m times, has become embroiled in a real political drama. Sales of the game vastly increased in the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak in China as information-strapped citizens sought to understand more about viral outbreaks. After the game topped Apple’s App Store charts in mid-January, the Chinese government ordered its removal, claiming that the game “includes content that is illegal in China as determined by the Cyberspace Administration of China”. Plague Inc., the most popular example in the burgeoning pandemic-spread genre of games, remains for sale elsewhere. For those who enjoy playing the role of the antagonist, the opportunity to do so at the molecular level is beguiling. For everyone else, it provides a sobering justification for the current restrictive measures under which critics and consumers alike must live.Animal Crossing: New Horizon(Nintendo Nintendo Switch)For those already tired of the sight of their front room and family members, Animal Crossing: New Horizon offers the ideal opportunity for domestic escapism: the chance to start a new life on a verdant island, where you can eke out a pastoral existence, fishing, foraging and felling trees while making friends with your anthropomorphic neighbours. This is a game to be played at a placid pace island life syncs to our own clock and calendar, and each new month brings with it new species of fish and insect, which can be caught and either sold or donated to the local museum. A monopolistic businessman called Tom Nook runs the local shop and will, if you so desire, extend your mortgage that you might expand your property and possessions. But with care, it’s possible to sidestep the consumerist trap and experience an older, simpler existence.Doom Eternal(id Software, Bethesda Softworks Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, Google Stadia, PC)One of the most influential video games of the early 90s, Doom was an unapologetically base shooter that pitted a lone space marine against a horde of Martian demons (a lavish TV dramatisation, titled Masters of Doom, is currently in development). Doom Eternal updates the visuals – sky-scraping fiends and one-eyed blobs lifted directly from a Dante cheese dream – but this remains an uncomplicated run-and-gun proposition, proving that, just occasionally, kinetic, quasi-pornographic thrills are enough to soak up the hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b1bb9cc7441400a1521055234c05a56ce7570b7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=986794c5f597c1c567935eebfd27ef87","title":"there is no greater pleasure than eating with my family what makes you smile","story":"For some, it’s remembering when they first met their partner, while for others it’s their dog that causes them to beam, says Kate Leahy. What’s the secret to making you grin?From a big beam to the littlest lift at the corners of your mouth, smiling is infectious in the best possible way. Which is happy news, as new research shows smiling can really improve our mood, spurring a chemical reaction in our brains. As adults, we smile 20-40 times a day – finding joy in small moments that matter is as important as taking care of your teeth and gums. Here, six people share what makes them smile.Hazel Gardiner, 41, floral artist“My dog, Ringo, has made me smile from the moment we met. He was the puppy in a lively litter of goldendoodles who came straight over, desperate to be near me. Ringo is really loving but has some funny quirks. He’s not scared of lightning, but if he sees a luggage trolley he freaks out. He’s also a ball stealer at the park. He can hold three in his mouth, so you need an extra ball to get him to drop them. There have been times when I’ve walked him in the morning and been late for work because he won’t drop someone else’s ball. Now, we take five with us just in case. If I’m working on my laptop, Ringo will nudge my hand with his nose for a cuddle. I’m smiling just thinking about him. I’ve made it my mission to look after my teeth and, as a result, I’m a big smiler.”Sukhi Wahiwala, 45, small business coach“In the Sikh faith we believe that, at a certain point, the roles reverse and children look after their parents. Sadly, a year ago, my mother passed away. Helping my father deal with the loss after 65 years of marriage has been challenging, but positive too. My four children call him Papaji. Because we’re so close, each one of us has been able to be a part of my mum for him. I’m my father’s sounding board. I love listening to stories from his youth. We often talk about my mum’s encyclopedic knowledge and we laugh when I prompt him in the same way she would, bringing his memory back to life.”Nick Gaskell, 35, mortgage adviser“I’ve always struggled with my teeth. I have weak gums from lack of brushing as a child, and my two front teeth cross over. Now I pay serious attention to cleaning my teeth thoroughly and I smile with more confidence. And it shows when I’m doing what I love – gardening. My girlfriend and I recently bought a flat in a mansion block in north London, complete with an overgrown garden. Suddenly, I’m that person who watches gardening tutorials on YouTube, invests in fairy lights and visits the garden centre at the weekend. Now I look out of my kitchen window and see lavender, pieris and my favourite blue hydrangea. There’s a huge sense of achievement.”Christine Brown, 59, housing officer“My oldest daughter had lots of allergies as a child, so I’ve always made everything from scratch since then. Food is a big part of our family life. I find cooking very therapeutic, but there is no greater pleasure in the world than sitting down to eat with my family and seeing their faces light up.”Mariatu Turay-Akar, 42, owner of fashion brand Gitas Portal“I feel so fortunate that my marriage is still, after 20 years and five children, full of love and constant laughter. We’re playful together he makes me feel young. I often forget I’m in my 40s. Remembering when we met brings me joy – though, actually, I wasn’t interested at first. I assumed that we wouldn’t have much in common, but he turned out to be the most witty, charming man, and loves the theatre – just like I do. I smile most when I’m around him.”Keri Tebbit, 32, course development manager“When my four-year-old daughter first saw my braces, she said: ‘Wow!’ like they were the coolest thing ever. I smile every time I remember it. Phoebe’s so funny – she gets excited about the most everyday things. Like her flashing toothbrush: she mostly chewed it at first, but now times me for two minutes while I clean her teeth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aee523294856358d659e8cf86f4e701d5fa32bb/0_1206_7676_4605/master/7676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c914f07ea43236ecab73f33dec62a04","title":"arts and crafts house in california with rich and interesting past","story":"A historic house that echoes with old features, bespoke furniture and a superb location is also a warm and welcoming family homeWhen Jennifer Doebler and her husband Pat Kelly made the move from an apartment in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village to San Francisco they still wanted to feel as though they were at the centre of things. But they also wanted a true family escape and a forever house for themselves and their two daughters. They found a way of balancing their needs in the form of an Arts \u0026amp Crafts home in bustling Berkeley, just across the Bay from San Francisco proper.“The houses are cheek-to-jowl in Berkeley, but we have a good-sized lot and a garden that is private and beautiful,” says Jennifer, who is, along with her husband, an executive in the world of pharmaceuticals. “We loved the shape of the house, the redwood, the windows and the views, and we could picture our family and our two girls growing up very happily here.”The house itself was built with timber in 1915, in a style known in the US as American Craftsman, and still has many of its original features, including the staircase and wall panelling. The family asked New York architects Studio Geiger to work on restoring the period Arts \u0026amp Crafts elements, as well as on an upgrade on the foundations, before turning to designer Roman Alonso of LA-based atelier Commune to work on the interiors.“We had admired Roman’s work for a long time, so we were very excited to work with him on our home,” says Jennifer. “It wasn’t just about getting it done. It was all about the process for us, so we were very involved and Roman was very patient. It was a lot of fun.”Alonso also embraced the original Craftsman, chalet-style aesthetic, with its sense of warmth and elegant proportions for the rooms. The house has landmark status, which meant a light touch throughout and limits on any major changes, which was a challenge when it came to the priority of introducing more natural light into the house. Alonso’s solution was a set of solar tubes that discreetly pump more sunshine into the entrance hallway and stairway.“We also used some old tricks to bring in more light,” says Alonso, “like lining glass cabinets with mirrors, and using metallic wallpapers and reflective finishes.”Jennifer and Pat wanted the interiors and furnishings to be of the highest quality, but they didn’t want the rooms to feel fussy or pretentious. “At our first meeting, as we sat in the living room, Jennifer told me: ‘I want my daughters to be able to do their homework and get married in this room.”’Alonso and his clients shared a mutual love for the work of Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann, one of the pioneers of early Modernist design, and a passion for midcentury Scandinavian style – both of which fed into the design process. The generously scaled living room – or “great room” – is blessed with a large run of windows and beautifully detailed timber panelling, as well as a brick fireplace.The large formal dining room was lovingly restored, using some tricks of the light, as was the grand staircase. Here, Jennifer and Pat chose a line from Dante’s Divine Comedy, which translates as “midway along the walk of life’” to decorate the original frieze line between the redwood panelling and the ceiling. This band of blue with gold lettering is echoed by the blues used on the ceiling panels in the entrance hall at the foot of the staircase.At the back of the house, Jennifer, Pat and their designer opted for a very different treatment. The kitchen and “mud room” (entrance area) offered the perfect opportunity to inject more in the way of colour into the house, with a custom geometric pattern painted on the floors and an eye-catching Vivienne Westwood wallpaper.“The kitchen, breakfast room and mud room were meant to feel much lighter and brighter,” says Alonso. “The wood panelling in those spaces had either been removed or painted over years ago, so it made it possible to maximise the brightness through the use of paint. The intention was to have some contrast between these more utilitarian but cheerful areas and the more formal rooms.”A collection of balconies, terraces and pergolas offers a choice of outdoor rooms and fresh-air spaces, lifted by the green backdrop of the gardens. Full of warmth and welcome, the house is a true haven by the Bay.“It really met all of our intentions,” says Jennifer. “Living in such a harmonious setting, even with the clutter of two kids and two dogs – really lifts your spirit and your mood. It’s not about perfection, but the workings of beauty in your life.”For more information visit commune design.

The bond between a mother and her adult child can be frenzied and fraught, loaded and exasperating, undermining and energy-sapping. As with all family relationships, so much of what’s going on is unsaid or coded. An outsider can only sense the ripples, while you are only too aware of the tsunami. But whatever it’s like, two things are true. First, this is a relationship that always matters and second, it can always be improved. Here’s how.1. Accept that you can’t change her. “You can’t change anyone else,” says Philippa Perry, psychotherapist and author of The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read. “But sometimes, if you change yourself, the other person will change as well. If you decide to be kind towards your mother, and accepting of her, that may shift your relationship. It’s not guaranteed, but it’s a possibility.”3. Recognise that what most bugs you about her is yourself. “What most angers us about our mothers is the traits we share with them,” says psychotherapist Julia Samuel, author of This Too Shall Pass: Stories of Change, Crisis and Hopeful Beginnings. “So it annoys you that she’s stingy, or impatient? That’s because you know deep down that you are, too. Be more compassionate – to your mother, but also to yourself.”4. Be sensitive to generational differences – but don’t put up with prejudice. “Our parents lived in a world with many different constructs,” says Professor Kevin Browne, director of the Centre for Forensic and Family Psychology at Nottingham University. The media reflected behaviour that would quite rightly not be tolerated today – so it’s not surprising, he says, if your mum isn’t as politically correct as you’d like her to be. What’s important is keeping the conversation going – and if you see where she’s coming from, she can hopefully see your point of view as well.5. Ask her about her life now. “Don’t assume that all she’s interested in is planting bulbs and watching telly,” says Perry. “And even if she is, hear her out. She might have some very interesting things to say about them.”6. Find time to be together. “My daughter has a new partner, and it’s ages since we saw one another on our own,” says a friend. “The other day she called me and said, ‘Mum, we need some hunkering-down time, just us two.’ We had a night in with a takeaway and a movie, and it was heaven.” “You have a different kind of conversation one-on-one,” says Samuel. “It reignites the bond.”7. Accept the limitations ageing puts on her. It’s about accepting that you’re ageing, too. “But don’t let your fear for yourself stop you from empathising with how your mum feels as she tackles the issues of being a few decades ahead of you,” says Samuel.8. Walk and talk. “It’s the most therapeutic way to have a conversation,” says Samuel. “That way you are not eyeballing one another, you are side by side and your bodies are in rhythm, you can have silences, you can be upset. Afterwards have a treat: tea and cake, or a pub lunch.” If your mum isn’t up to walking, a chat in the car works, too.9. Don’t put it off. “People go years and years intending to have a better relationship with their mum,” says Browne. “Then suddenly she’s dead, and coping with bereavement is much harder if you have guilt and regret.”10. Don’t moan to her about your siblings. “My sister and I used to have a row, and then we’d each reach for the phone to call our mother,” says a friend. That’s not fair: you’re out of the playpen now. “You’re putting her in an impossible situation,” says Browne. “It creates conflict and conflict creates anxiety, and it’s not fair to make your mother feel anxious.”11. Don’t blame her. “I spent years blaming my mother for more or less everything,” says forensic psychologist Judith Wenban-Smith. “Eventually I realised she was as much a victim of her circumstances as I felt she’d made me of mine.” Working that out early goes a long way.12. Choose activities with her, not you, in mind. “Think about things she might not feel up to on her own,” says Wenban-Smith. “My own mother loved trips to National Trust properties, and I’d make sure I got her to them.” Taking your mum on holiday (and not because you want her to do the childcare!) can be a great treat in a lovely setting, and underlines how much you value her.13. Forgive her. We all make mistakes, and your mother’s mistakes have had huge repercussions across your life. But unless she had truly serious issues, your mother wanted to do her best by you. “Finding it in your heart to forgive her will transform your life, as well as your relationship with her,” says Samuel.14. Don’t put her on a pedestal. “For years I did that,” says Rakhi Chand, psychotherapist and counsellor. “Then I realised she was a person just like me, with faults and failings and issues she struggled with. I had to acknowledge the loss, but it allowed me to deal with the reality of my mother, rather than the fantasy version.”15. Press pause. “We often react in a knee-jerk way,” says Chand. Instead, when your mother says that maddening thing, step away. Take yourself off somewhere and take time to think about why it makes you feel as you do.16. Aspire to an authentic relationship with her. “With mothers it’s a relationship fraught with obligation and expectation, and there’s the need for approval that we carry from childhood,” says Chand. So it’s a tough one, but the first step is being aware of what matters to you. And what helps you work that out is to…17. Call her when you want to, rather than out of obligation. “I was stuck in a cycle of guilt and frustration, and feeling obliged to call her and meet up with her,” says Chand. “But then I talked it through with her, and now I call her when I want to talk. It’s got us out of a rut.”18. Talk to someone about her – a friend, or a therapist. “Don’t bottle up your feelings about your mother – share them with a person you trust,” says Browne. It will help you work out what you feel, and why.19. Be grateful for the small things. She looked after your kids when you were sick she paid for your new cooker when your bank account was empty. “Often at the time you’re not properly grateful because you’ve got so much else on your plate,” says Wenban-Smith. “But later – maybe years later – it’s good to acknowledge what a difference it made, and to thank her.”20. And the big ones. “She brought you into the world, made sacrifices for you. She’s had her own crosses to bear and you’ll never fully know what they were,” says Samuel. “No one has the perfect mother, but she’s the only one you’ll ever have – and life is better if you can love her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c97b38d295e4f539a6e9de633b30e2ac2036c293/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82be30eb210dd81a1c8abab3c1abb608","title":"coronavirus writing live blog updates format","story":"What’s it like being in charge of a minute-by-minute update on a global pandemic that 7 million people are following?It started out as a bit of an experiment in 2007, an attempt to take what sports journalists were doing with minute-by-minute coverage of cricket and football and see if it would work with fast-paced news events.It did. More than a dozen years later, the ’s live blog format (a rolling screed of real-time news updates written by journalists like me) is one of our most successful digital innovations ever, prodigiously utilised, much copied – and so well read that it can be daunting for those doing the writing.Take the coronavirus story. As the news about the pandemic becomes grimmer and the measures to combat it ever more drastic, the interest from readers has only grown. At the start of March the coronavirus live blog was already attracting 3 million page views each day. By this week, daily figures for the blog were more than 7 million.As one of a pool of reporters called upon to liveblog coronavirus, these are intimidating figures. It isn’t easy imagining all those eyeballs glaring at typos in your latest post, while you struggle to keep on top of a rapidly moving story that has hit all parts of the world.Indeed, there are moments when you might wonder about the impact of this kind of journalism, with its rapid-fire, alert-style updates and overwhelming tide of information. A very few readers have told us they find it all too much in an anxious world. We try to mitigate by bringing in breadth and context wherever possible. Fortunately, help is at hand from reporters all over the world, colleagues in the office and, crucially, readers. All of us who do the coronavirus live blog have been sent a stream of emails, tweets and texts from readers with helpful tips, insights, corrections, and encouragement. These are particularly useful from areas of the world where we don’t have correspondents.A  subscriber from Greenland got in touch this week to tell us about the island’s first confirmed case. Anders Madsen, a nurse from the capital, Nuuk, became the live blog’s Greenland coronavirus correspondent, with a post about concerns over delays in verifying cases because tests have to be confirmed in Denmark. This prompted another reader from the Falklands to report similar concerns about tests having to go to the UK for confirmation.Doctors have also been in touch to share their expertise and concerns. And generally readers have let us know how they and their relatives are coping. One shared a video of her mother singing about all the things she’s been doing while locked down in her flat in Spain. Putting lighter content like this on the blog isn’t always appropriate, and risks trivialising an incredibly serious crisis. But when it feels right to do so, it can help break up what would otherwise be a fairly unremitting string of updates.Among the first that I did were on the floods in the UK in 2007. It was an era before Twitter and we were using a blogging platform that would crash almost every time you tried to embed a video.Minute-by-minute reports, as they were known then, were initially frowned on by some senior figures in the . They were regarded as good for football but not for serious news stories – the first draft of the first draft of history, if you like. However, the popularity of the format soon changed minds. And when the website and print reporters integrated into one team, live blogs became central to the way the site covered major breaking stories. Greatly improved liveblogging software and increased involvement of correspondents from around the world made the  live blogs more respected and even better read.The torrent of major developments on coronavirus makes the story virtually impossible to cover through conventional news stories. By the time such stories are written, edited and published, they are often already out of date. Only by following events in real time can you satisfy readers’ desire for up-to-date news about Covid-19.But the virus is testing even this flexible format. On some days the website has carried up to five live blogs on the subject as it hits business, UK, US and Australian politics, and global affairs.There is so much to cover, it can be very tricky to convey the key developments. As a live blogger, you are frantically trying to keep several important plates spinning all at once – with the latest from China, Italy, Iran, and the UK, plus the effect on sport, the arts, and the economy, and all those briefings from the World Health Organization. Taking a step back to summarise what’s been going on risks at least some of these plates crashing down. Colleagues often have to help out while you put together a summary.And it threatens to become even more difficult to cover as more of us are forced to work from home.

First and boldest into the arena has been the Berlin Philharmonic (“The Philharmonie is closed – so we will come to you!”), removing all charges from its online streaming service. Go to digitalconcerthall and enter the code BERLINPHIL by 31 March. Here you will find, among concerts from Karajan to Abbado, a recent concert under Simon Rattle that was streamed live without an audience. Berio’s phantasmagorical Sinfonia is juxtaposed with a sumptuously sonorous Bartók Concerto for Orchestra. Elsewhere on the site there’s the latest from new chief conductor Kirill Petrenko, pushing into the music of the 1940s with Stravinsky’s Symphony for Three Orchestras, Zimmermann and Rachmaninov.• There is something eerie about seeing a full orchestra in formal dress playing to an empty hall. The maverick conductor of the Budapest Festival Orchestra, Iván Fischer, declares that this is not the right time for orchestral music (probably because those concerts of his have been cancelled). He prefers to deploy his skilful players in chamber music combinations in nightly Quarantine Soirées, at bfz.hu – an hour or so of small-scale music-making from Mozart and Beethoven to Schubert and beyond. Fischer is a perpetual innovator of new formats.• If you prefer the large-scale spectacular, then the politan Opera in New York is providing a free stream via its homepage of a classic from its archive each evening at 7.30pm New York time (11.30pm GMT), available for 20 hours. So wake up here tomorrow morning and you can still catch Valery Gergiev conducting Renée Fleming, Ramón Vargas and Dmitri Hvorostovsky in Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin (from February 2007). Closer to home, Opera North is now streaming Wagner’s epic four-part Ring cycle, free.• In the UK, this is a chance to remind ourselves, through the invaluable provision of live concerts on Radio 3, just how central to our musical life are the BBC’s own orchestras – one of the many benefits provided by the licence fee. Start with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, on terrific form for Donald Runnicles in Bruckner’s towering Eighth Symphony (BBC Sounds), imaginatively preceded by the wondrous Carolyn Sampson in Henri Dutilleux’s song cycle Correspondances. (But hurry: thanks to the restrictions on BBC Sounds, which should surely be lifted now, it’s only available until 27 March.)• The BBC Symphony Orchestra, conductor Stefan Solyom, celebrated Heroic Strokes of the Bow – female composers from Germaine Tailleferre to Judith Weir (BBC Sounds until 6 April) Mark Wigglesworth conducted the BBC Philharmonic in Beethoven’s rarely heard Cantata on the Death of the Emperor Joseph II (until 25 March) while the Ulster Orchestra conducted by Jac van Steen partnered one of the most interesting of younger pianists, Hannes Minnaar, in Schumann’s Piano Concerto (until 4 April).• As schools close and music conservatoires move to online tuition, there will be a chance for anyone to test the ever-expanding area of web-based teaching: expect an explosion of offers formal and informal from grounded musicians, such as tuition from the violinist Tasmin Little: 20-minute quick-solve lessons or 60-minute in-depth ones.

The first of these 10 tracks, Barron’s catchy bossa nova, Porto Alegre, provides a perfect example. There are no solos, as such, but one or another will come to the fore while the others quietly keep the momentum going.All three are outstanding musicians whose every move is elegant and assured.

However, the coronavirus outbreak has led firms to demand immediate aid.Graham Vidler, the chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies, said: “Operators are under extreme pressure and facing impossible choices over which routes they have to cut and how many staff may have to go. We urgently need the government to help now to secure the future of the industry.”Firms collectively employ about 100,000 drivers and 120,000 support staff. More journeys are made by buses than trains, not least by key workers and the public to reach hospitals.The confederation said companies were ready to help the national response to the crisis in different ways, possibly using buses as mobile grocery stores for people self-isolating, or as mobile virus testing units.Meanwhile, train companies started to confirm which services would be pared back across Britain from Monday, with passengers urged to stop all non-essential travel.About half the timetable will be cut after ministers and rail operators across England, Scotland and Wales agreed to ensure core services and freight could keep running.Operators pledged to run enough trains for key workers and to allow the public to access medical appointments, as well as maintaining the flow of goods by rail. Franchised train operators have minimum service obligations and could have faced contractual penalties without government dispensation.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We are taking decisive action to protect the public, which means reducing travel for the time being, whilst still ensuring key worker heroes can get to their jobs to keep this nation running.”Shapps suggested this week that more rail networks could be temporarily nationalised but the government would be “flexible” over contracts. Several franchises were in financial difficulty because of stalling passenger numbers even before the current crisis.Operators will publish next week’s schedules by Sunday lunchtime. Many, including Northern, have already been forced to cancel dozens of trains at short notice because of sickness and self-isolation.

South Western Railway will cut all services on some branches, last trains will depart earlier from London Waterloo, and major lines will have only half-hour or hourly services, particularly outside peak hours. Southeastern said it would attempt to keep all stations open for now and stretch schedules over as much of the day as possible. Govia Thameslink Railway said it would make a second batch of cuts in a week’s time, and has already slashed trains to Gatwick airport.Network Rail has said retailers in its stations will not have to pay rent for the first quarter.In the capital, a reduced London Underground service has come into effect with the closure of 40 stations and the axing of the night tube.National Express said it would be running only a limited number of its nationwide coach services from Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f11ce5c6471d76be62687aec515c5af90b917da/0_388_3700_2220/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5135ef15be312ad1967cc527bcce46a9","title":"is hydrogen the solution to net zero home heating","story":"Up to a third of the UK’s greenhouse emissions come from central heating. But a switch from natural gas to hydrogen, one of three proposals for greener energy, has experts idedOn 27 June 2019, the energy and clean growth minister Chris Skidmore signed papers that committed the UK to reduce carbon emissions to effectively nothing by 2050. If we are to stand any chance of meeting this target, known as “net zero”, there is one enormous challenge that we will have to tackle: home heating.Hydrogen is abundant in the natural world and according to its advocates could power the next generation of gas appliances cleanly and efficiently.“The attraction of hydrogen is that for a lot of consumers, they wouldn’t notice any difference. Customers would continue to use a boiler to heat their homes in a similar manner to natural gas,” says Robert Sansom of the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s energy policy panel. He is the lead author on a study conducted by the institute called Transitioning to Hydrogen.Together with colleagues, Sansom assessed the engineering risks and uncertainties associated with swapping our gas network to hydrogen. Their conclusion is that there is no reason why repurposing the gas network to hydrogen cannot be achieved.That’s not to say it would be easy, though. Technological and practical hurdles exist because there is no blueprint for such a conversion: there is nowhere in the world that supplies pure hydrogen to homes and businesses. The UK would have to pioneer everything.“They went into a lot of detail, from the hydrogen production plants right the way down to people’s homes,” says Sansom.The report drew a parallel to the way the gas industry converted from town gas to natural gas in the 1960s and 70s. Town gas was a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. It was mostly produced from the distillation of coal and oil and had been used for the first 150 years of the UK’s gas industry. With the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, which is predominantly methane, the UK undertook a nationwide programme to convert 40m appliances over a decade.Whole streets would be converted at a time. Engineers would inspect the gas appliances, and then convert them. Simultaneously, the town gas was disconnected and the pipelines were purged with an inert gas. Finally, the natural gas was pumped into the system and the engineers would make sure each appliance worked correctly before moving to the next street along.Some manufacturers are now so convinced that a similar thing can happen with hydrogen that they have already begun to develop new household appliances. In February, Worcester Bosch unveiled the prototype of its hydrogen-ready boiler. It would run first on natural gas and then, after a servicing visit, hydrogen.“Effectively we started a programme of hydrogen-proofing our gas network without knowing we were doing it,” says Sansom, who found himself becoming more and more impressed by the concept. “From a personal point of view, I was very much on the fence when I kicked off with this work. But I found myself slipping down on the hydrogen side in terms of its viability as a low carbon alternative to natural gas,” he says.But not everyone is convinced by this sudden interest in hydrogen. Richard Lowes of the University of Exeter Energy Policy Group says that until recently the received wisdom had been that heating would have to be electrified in some way to meet our climate-crisis commitments. “That has basically come out of years and years of technical and economic modelling to look at how you get to fully decarbonised heating in the UK,” says Lowes.Switching heating from gas to electricity would mean relying on heat pumps. These use electricity to extract heat from either the air or the ground. In the case of an air source heat pump, it works like a fridge but instead of sucking heat out of a food compartment, it pulls it out of the air and channels it into the home, where it is used to heat water, which is piped to radiators for central heating, and stored in a tank for hot water.But because this technology works at a lower temperature than existing boilers, it requires many homes to be much better insulated, or to have larger radiators, capable of delivering more heating power. For those who have switched to heat-as-you-go combi boilers, it will necessitate the reinstallation of a hot water tank.It’s extensive work but worth it, according to Lowes, who has removed his own gas boiler and is now using an air source heat pump to heat his home. “It was a lot of work but my home and heating system are now a lot more efficient. It’s always warm, there’s always hot water and it’s basically the same cost to run as gas,” he says.The third approach is called district heating. It envisages water being heated at a central facility using waste heat from industry or green sources such as solar power. The hot water is then delivered to many homes simultaneously through a network of heavily insulated underground pipes. Both methods can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of home heating but the downside is that they require extensive work to roll them out on a national scale.District heating would require water pipes to be laid under homes, and the widespread use of heat pumps would necessitate the National Grid’s electricity circuits being upgraded. It is this kind of disruption that hydrogen’s advocates say could be avoided because much of the national infrastructure has already been upgraded. That argument cuts no ice with Lowes. “It seems a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can’t dig up the roads when they’ve been doing it for the past 20 years,” he says.He points out that although the consumer may not experience so much disruption, significant challenges for the gas industry remain. For example, the National Transmission System, which is the network of pipes that supplies gas from the coastal terminals to the gas distribution companies and other major users, is made of metal. This would need to be protected from embrittlement in some way before any switch to hydrogen could take place.“Hydrogen is certainly not a silver bullet,” says Lowes. And if we get distracted by it, we could be getting ourselves into more trouble, missing the 2050 energy target altogether.But if there is so much uncertainty with hydrogen, why is the gas industry, which funds many of the studies, pushing it so hard? According to Chris Goodall, energy economist and author of What We Need to Do Now for a Zero Carbon Future, it is a matter of survival.“They do not wish for their industry to be eaten up by a switch to electricity for heating. So they are moving as fast as they can to persuade us about hydrogen,” he says. And it all comes down to how the gas is produced.Hydrogen is not found on Earth in a pure state. Instead, it has to be extracted from other substances, and the best one to extract it from is methane – in other words natural gas. Hence, the gas companies could effectively keep their current operations running.But the extra steps involved in extracting the hydrogen would push the price up. Additionally, the extraction creates carbon dioxide as a byproduct, so large scale carbon capture technology would need to be developed to prevent it escaping into the atmosphere. Although this is a technology that the UK will have to develop anyway in order to reach net zero by 2050, it will add to the cost.But natural gas is not the only substance that contains hydrogen. Water does too, and the hydrogen can be freed by a process called electrolysis, which doesn’t create any carbon dioxide. To make it totally green, which is the ultimate hope, electrolysis could be powered by wind farms. At the moment, however, the price of such electricity is expensive, and that would push the price of hydrogen up still further.Goodall hopes that the cost will decrease as technology improves, but warns: “You can be accused of mindless optimism just by saying this.”The UK’s future energy landscape is without doubt a difficult realm to navigate. Perhaps the best route will be revealed by not pitting the various solutions against one another. “All three have strengths and weaknesses and I expect that there’ll be a major role for each as a replacement for natural gas,” says Sansom. Even hydrogen’s detractors acknowledge this. “As a niche technology it can have real value,” says Lowes. He goes on to paraphrase the Heineken lager adverts of the 70s and 80s, saying that hydrogen could potentially reach the parts of the country that other energy solutions can’t.Goodall also sees a role for hydrogen to “store” energy generated from renewable resources such as wind and solar power. The idea is that in windy months, any extra electricity generated from renewables will be used to make hydrogen, which would then be stored. When there is extra demand on the National Grid, or a seasonal drop in the power produced from renewables, the hydrogen can be burned to produce electricity.The truth is that all options for us to decarbonise our heating systems will require significant disruption and cost. And while government continues to deliberate, the clock ticks towards 2050.“There is no need to wait. We can deploy stuff now that works fine,” says Lowes, referring to his own experience of changing his gas boiler for a heat pump. “The urgency of climate change means there really isn’t any reason to delay.”Others believe that there is a role for hydrogen and think it is worth taking a little more time to consider. But there is one truth that everyone agrees upon. “None of this is easy. If anyone is saying to you this is easy, they are misleading you,” says Lowes.Hydrogen can also power vehicles, but in a different way than it would heat houses. Instead of being burned, the hydrogen reacts with oxygen inside a device called a fuel cell. Electricity and water are produced. The electricity runs the car, the water drips from the exhaust pipe.An attempt to switch to hydrogen vehicles in the 1990s was thwarted byelectric cars, which store their energy in an onboard battery. But a new push for hydrogen vehicles is coming from Asia. China, Japan and South Korea have all set ambitious goals to have millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by 2030.Toyota and Hyundai are both offering hydrogen vehicles in the UK, but there are currently less than 20 hydrogen filling stations across the UK, mostly clustered around the M25.“It will be really interesting to see what happens,” says Lowes. But he himself is not convinced: “Hydrogen is much more expensive than electricity, and the car is more expensive than the electric vehicle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75663ad2687911fcdcc02df1f5958fc48c03519d/0_215_2584_1550/master/2584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfc8c3c738cd65e216c913ad8e27a5b","title":"ukad rebukes uk athletics over withheld report into salazar and farah","story":"The UK Anti-Doping Agency has delivered an extraordinary rebuke to UK Athletics for its repeated refusal to hand over a 2015 internal report into Alberto Salazar’s relationship with Mo Farah, which is said to contain sensitive medical data.Ukad is understood to be angry and disappointed to have received only an edited PowerPoint summary of the report by UKA’s performance oversight committee, which was led by three former athletes and concluded there were “no concerns” about Farah continuing with Salazar.In a highly unusual and pointed statement, Ukad’s chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, said: “We remind UKA that they are bound by the National Anti-Doping Policy. We call again on UKA to hand over this review in full, including the associated supporting reports and documents.She added: “We have repeatedly requested that UK Athletics share this POC review with us in its entirety as there could be information included that is of interest to us.”However, UK Athletics insists that the five-year delay has been caused by the need to get consents from certain parties before handing over the report. “Any implication by anyone that UKA is being obstructive in this matter or in any way failing in its duties, is wholly wrong and inaccurate,” a spokesperson said.UK Athletics also insisted that its lawyers had received correspondence on Friday afternoon from Ukad’s in-house legal team “setting out a framework and reassurances of confidentiality to enable UKA to share documents containing sensitive information within the 2015 POC review, which UKA have been advised needs specific consents. This was in response to a letter dated 3 March 2020 from UKA lawyers to Ukad. UKA and Ukad have been addressing this cooperatively, to enable access to relevant documents in compliance with legal duties.”On Friday a separate independent report into UK Athletics’ relationship with Salazar between 2011 and 2017 by the sports lawyer John Mehrzad revealed that UK Athletics had not kept minutes of vital meetings in which Farah and Salazar’s relationship was discussed, and also expressed unease that UK Athletics’ 2015 review was in-house and may have been seen to lack independence. But he found it had come to a reasonable conclusion.Surprisingly, Mehrzad does not appear to have consulted Ukad before publishing his findings. The Observer has also discovered that redacted sections of Mehrzad’s report can be accessed by copying and pasting them into a Microsoft Word document.In October Salazar, who guided Farah to four Olympic and five world titles between 2011 and 2017, was banned for four years for doping. Salazar has said he will appeal against the ban. Farah has maintained his innocence and no Salazar athlete has tested positive.Meanwhile, a growing number of sporting bodies, including USA Swimming and USA Track and Field, are now calling for the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed.

It came late Friday, only a few hours after USA Swimming’s CEO sent a similar letter.Now, the sports that accounted for 65 of America’s 121 medals and 175 of its 554 athletes at the last Summer Games are on record in urging, in Siegel’s words, “the USOPC, as a leader within the Olympic Movement, to use its voice and speak up for the athletes”.Other national committees are already doing that. The federations in Norway and Brazil each went public with requests to postpone.“Our clear recommendation is that the Olympic Games in Tokyo shall not take place before the COVID-19 situation is under firm control on a global scale,” Norway’s federation wrote in a letter to IOC President Thomas Bach.The US brings the largest contingent to every Summer Games and wins the most medals – both factors that lead have led NBC to pay billions to televise the games through 2032. It would seem to give the USOPC leverage in talks about almost any subject with the IOC, but the federation has been reluctant to use its power. It spent years, in fact, trying to smooth over tense relations with its international partners.And since Hirshland took over as CEO in 2018, the focus has been inward, as the sex-abuse scandals that have consumed American sports have shifted the focus to athlete welfare and safety.Hirshland and the USOPC board chair, Susanne Lyons, were insistent that the USOPC won’t sacrifice athlete safety in the current crisis. But they stopped well short of pushing the IOC toward a postponement.“The decision about the games does not lie directly with us,” Lyons said in a conference call with reporters Friday. “It lies with WHO, the Japanese government and the IOC. Under no circumstance would the USOPC send atheltes into harm’s way if didn’t think it was safe.”Leaders of the track and swimming teams don’t appear willing to take that risk, either, though whether they’ll act on their own – without the sign-off from the USOPC – remains in question. The leader of the third sport that makes up the backbone of the Olympics – gymnastics – has sent a survey to athletes, asking for their thoughts on what the USA Gymnastics stance should be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e98764983cecfe1e00eb9b6b7bcada105b1e383/0_0_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4a0f6ba019c33d296f88e0bede49107","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"As the coronavirus causes venues to close their doors, an increase of live-streamed theatre is expected.

At the moment, as we speak, they’re building the massive lasagne sheets.”He added: “They’re putting the underground heating at Wembley on, that’s going to bake the lasagne, and then they’re putting the roof across and that’s going to recreate the oven, and then what they’re going to do is lift it up with drones and cut off little portions and drop it off to people’s houses.”He sent the clip, at 1pm on Thursday, to a group of 30 friends he plays football with. Some of them then forwarded it to friends and relatives in other groups. Hours later, it was being sent back to McLean by friends who had no idea it was his voice, having travelled around the world in the intervening hours.McLean said: “It was just a one take. I sent it to the football group, my mum and the girl that I’m trying to date.“It went around the football group. Then I got people that I know forwarding it to me, not knowing it was me, or forwarding it to me asking if I’d heard it. Ex-girlfriends were coming out of the woodwork asking was it me.”By Friday morning, the Football Association was able to confirm that, yes, it was indeed aware of the clip but, no, it had no plans to turn the English national football stadium into a giant lasagne dish.The spread of the clip shows both the enormous power of WhatsApp to spread unsourced information at speed and Britons’ need for something to laugh at in a grim period.WhatsApp’s lack of an ability to track or factcheck material means that the clip was arriving in people’s messaging service as an unlabelled audio clip. Although there is no way to measure its audience, it is likely to have been listened to by millions of people within hours. Many more have since heard it after it was uploaded to other services.McLean suggested that people needed to resist the urge to share unsourced information about the coronavirus, especially those claiming to be from insiders.“The intentions are good but the outcome most of the time is pretty bad, it makes people panic more,” he said. “There’s no validation for what’s being said in the messages.”He said people needed to have their wits about them when it comes to seeking out trustworthy news in the crisis: “If someone sitting at home in their boxers selling software can save a one-minute clip and make it go viral, you’ve got be aware that anyone can put anything out and it might not be valid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e33044ab9b431f127257bd580d320579797bdd/20_0_5158_3095/master/5158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d03faa2c22f2c0f21d37f16fab0497","title":"readers tips visit wildlife nature reserve uk sawdays stay","story":"Whether it’s a wetlands, mountainside, coastal fringe, forest or heath … share details of your favourite UK nature reserveAs with all attractions, some wildlife reserves may be closed during the coronavirus outbreak.

He added that he would “go back if it would help the country”.“I think the majority of the UAW members wouldn’t mind doing what it takes to get America back running,” Jackson said. Though workers just demanded to leave the plant over coronavirus fears, Jackson said the cause has changed.“Instead of working for profit, you’re working to help save some lives, and I think a lot of people would join in on that,” he said. “It’s what they did during wartime, and that’s what they say we’re in now. I think that if it was on a voluntary basis they could get people to go back in.”Both automakers have confirmed that they are in discussions with the US government, which this week invoked the Defense Production Act, legislation that goes back to the second world war and grants the president broad powers to direct industrial production.“Right now, we are doing an internal study to evaluate this as an option, and we are looking at ways we could help during this crisis including potentially supporting production of medical equipment such as ventilators,” a GM spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, told the .However, a United Auto Workers spokesman, Brian Rothenberg, said the proposal had not been run by the union. Its leadership was busy working to shut down the plants and did not immediately have a comment, he added.It’s unclear how retooling the factories or sending workers back into them during a pandemic might work. The Trump administration economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told Fox News this week that an executive said she “might even ask them to do it on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons. That’s the kind of can-do spirit that we’re hearing and seeing”.Ford, which will suspend production following Thursday evening shifts through 30 March, said in a statement that it “stands ready to help the administration in any way we can, including the possibility of producing ventilators and other equipment”.“We have had preliminary discussions with the US governments and are looking into the feasibility. It’s vital that we all pull together to help the country weather this crisis and come out the other side stronger than ever,” it said.In the meantime some 150,000 UAW workers will be put on a temporary layoff. A GM spokesman, David Barnas, said employees “will be compensated”, though specifics were still being hammered out.“It’s the right thing to do, but they should’ve done it a couple days ago,” said a worker from Ford’s Dearborn Truck Plant who declined to provide his name.The UAW has been pushing for temporary closures for several days. Automakers initially resisted those calls, prompting threats of a walkout among an increasingly frustrated workforce. On Monday, UAW Local 600 filed a grievance at the Dearborn Truck Plant in which it demanded a two-week suspension and coronavirus testing for all employees.Any return to work will have to come with better safety protections for workers during the pandemic.The UAW president, Rory Gamble, said temporary closures were “the prudent thing to do”.“These companies will be put on notice that the UAW will use any and all measures to protect our brothers and sisters who are working in their facilities,” Gamble said. “And make no mistake, we have powerful allies who have stepped up to help us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/195ab3768ccbce33c5a730918d2895182031fb4e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a77fdee261b96c7911b35b998be466b","title":"mike bloomberg transfers 18m to democratic national committee","story":"Former presidential candidate will also transfer offices in six battleground states to help defeat TrumpMike Bloomberg is transferring $18m (£15.5m) from his presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee in the largest single such transfer ever made.The largesse is the latest sign of the billionaire businessman’s continued involvement in the presidential race since ending his own campaign this month after a lacklustre showing on Super Tuesday. In the 3 March primaries the former New York city mayor won only one US territory.Bloomberg’s contribution amounts to more than the national party’s typical cash balance. The transfer will help the DNC make up some of the steep fundraising shortfall it has compared with its Republican counterpart, which routinely has raised tens of millions more in election cycles.Bloomberg, one of the world’s wealthiest men with a net worth estimated to exceed $60bn, promised throughout his campaign that he would help Democrats try to defeat Donald Trump regardless of how his own White House bid fared.The Bloomberg campaign, which hired a staff of 2,400 people across 43 states, will also transfer its offices in six pivotal states to the Democratic parties in those states, to help accelerate their hiring and organising. Those states are Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Former Bloomberg campaign staffers in those offices will continue to be paid by his campaign through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April. After that, they could in theory offer the state parties a trained and ready pool of potential hires to build out their operations heading into the November general election.Bloomberg had promised staffers when they were hired that they would be paid until November, but earlier this month most of his campaign team was told they had been let go and would be paid until the end of March.DNC officials said Bloomberg’s money and real-estate transfers would be used to expand the party’s 12-state battleground program, with a focus on hiring additional staffers to work in organising and data operations. Bloomberg’s former campaign employees will not have any advantage in the hiring process, officials said.Bloomberg and his team were making good on their commitment to stay engaged through to November, said Tom Perez, the DNC’s chairman. He said the support would help Democrats win up and down the ballot and help make sure Donald Trump was a one-term president.Bloomberg dropped out of the race on 4 March, the day after his Super Tuesday disappointment. Since then he has given tens of millions of his own money to various Democratic groups and causes.In a memo to Perez announcing the transfer, the Bloomberg campaign said that while Trump’s mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis should cost him, “we should also not assume that Trump’s incompetence will be enough to make him a one-term president”.“Trump’s ability to lie and propagate misinformation, particularly using digital tools and other means with swing voters in battleground states, will continue to ensure a close race in November. Every decision we make as Democrats must account for this,” the campaign wrote.Since exiting the race, Bloomberg has contributed $500,000 to Voto Latino to help register Latino voters, $2m to the group Collective Future to help register African American voters, and $2m to Swing Left, a group focused on electing Democrats in swing districts.The DNCs battleground effort targets Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. It’s a mix of states that have flipped back-and-forth between the two parties in recent presidential cycles and a few that have leaned Republican but are expected to be competitive in November.Though the DNC will never match its GOP counterpart in financial muscle, Perez and party leaders have placed a premium on coordination across the Democratic spectrum this presidential cycle after watching Republicans quietly upstage them on data operations and voter outreach in 2016.Bloomberg’s direct aid to the national party is possible only because he was a presidential candidate. Federal campaign finance laws place caps on how much an inidual can give a political party committee. But iniduals can loan or contribute as much of their personal money to their campaigns as they want. In turn, presidential campaigns can transfer unlimited sums to official party committees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a7d9b7d072d8e9164f83a2e0c09283b5f43cc26/0_25_719_431/master/719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba1d8608ecb314c684fbc19fd654545b","title":"proud boys michigan hispanic majority city","story":"Morgan Bolles’s new job for the Fennville, Michigan, city commission was uncontroversial until his affiliation with the Proud Boys anti-immigrant group came to lightIn many ways, Fennville, Michigan, represents the changing face of rural America. The small coffee shop, antique mall and mechanic in its quaint, four-block downtown are neighbors with a tortilla factory and Mexican supermarket. A mix of Hiic and white people went about their business on a recent afternoon.Just outside of town, several churches offer service in Spanish. The community center has soccer fields to go with its basketball courts. The school district developed a program to accommodate the children of hundreds of Mexican migrant workers who earn their keep in the corn, soybean and blueberry fields surrounding Fennville.It’s a picture of integration that’s essential to America’s agricultural industry, but Fennville’s story also includes a darker part of the larger narrative.The seemingly benign appointment of Morgan Bolles to the Fennville city commission in December exploded in controversy when days later it was revealed the 32-year-old is part of the Proud Boys, a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group whose nationalistic members have pushed anti-immigrant views.Bolles didn’t disclose his affiliation with the Proud Boys ahead of the appointment, and Fennville’s commissioners say they were duped. In the intense and emotional discussion that followed, a picture of a racially ided town emerged. Many view Bolles’s presence as a stain on the Hiic-majority city of about 1,800 in western Michigan. Many others support him.“Racism is part of America – it’s just who we are,” said Sergio Reyes, a Fennville resident who moved to the US from Mexico about 40 years ago and describes himself as “American to the bone”.“What’s good is that we know him, this is all out in the open, and you got people like myself who are willing to speak up on the problem,” Reyes added. “If he does something racist in the open, now we can deal with it.”Several Hiic employees of a Fennville business who declined to give their name echoed that sentiment.“That’s America,” one said. Another added that they were not particularly concerned as long as Bolles (pronounced “bowls”) wasn’t pushing his views on the commission. “We just have to keep working and making a better life and not let it affect us.”Fennville’s Hiic population grew in recent decades as migrants arrived for jobs in nearby fields, as well as those at a large facility owned by the food processing giant ConAgra. The strength in numbers is also reassuring, said another Hiic Fennville resident who declined to give her name.“It’s a dangerous group, it’s a racist group, so of course some people are upset. But what can we do at this point? There’s many of us, and now we know he’s there and we watch,” she added.The Proud Boys are widely regarded as a racist, misogynistic, anti-liberal organization that has a “tactical defense arm” to engage in violence with its perceived enemies. Though it claims not to be racist or aligned with the alt-right and other white supremacist organizations, some of its members and leadership are openly Islamophobic, anti-immigrant and antisemitic.Bolles declined multiple requests for an interview with the , though his social media posts appear to convey his feelings towards minorities and LGTBQ+ people. One shows Bolles flashing the “OK” symbol with his hand, which is a gesture used to convey support for white supremacy. Another shows Bolles in a T-shirt with a picture of a limp-wristed Che Guevara above the words “Socialism Is For F-gs”. When a Detroit News reporter previously asked about the shirt, Bolles said it meant “Figs”.His affiliation with the Proud Boys only came to light after a group called Vigilant Anti-Fascist Action posted photos outing him. Fennville’s city commissioner, Jim Hayden, said he “felt terrible” when he learned of Bolles’s membership . He and other commissioners said they were deceived by Bolles, who didn’t mention the Proud Boys affiliation in interviews or his application.Bolles has previously said he didn’t offer the information because no one asked.“It’s just childish to say ‘Nobody asked me’,” Hayden said. “If you have honor, dignity, respect and care about the job, then you tell the people interviewing you ‘I’ve got some things to tell you about’.”Bolles isn’t alone in his political ambitions on the far right. Though there’s no clear data available on how many far-right extremists are running for local offices around the country, anecdotal evidence suggests more are doing so, said Cassie Miller, a research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center.Leaked chats from the white nationalist group White Evropa showed the group’s leadership urging its members to infiltrate the GOP and run for local office, and at least eight white nationalists ran for state office in 2018.Another was appointed precinct captain for the Republican party in Washington, while Matt Shea, a Washington state representative, has said that males who support abortion and same-sex marriage should be killed. He was later found to be planning surveillance of and violence against perceived political enemies on the left, and has been labeled a domestic terrorist in a report by independent investigators commissioned by the Washington legislature.“Anecdotally, we’re seeing more extremist candidates running for office who are galvanized by Trump’s rhetoric and use his model – if you vilify immigrants and Muslims, that will rile up people and get them to vote, so we’re seeing more people parroting him,” Miller said. “The model of the organized right has been to get people in at the local level and move up the ranks.”Fennville’s city charter and state law doesn’t offer any remedy except a recall, and that process can’t be started for a year. Bolles’s appointment is for two years, so it’s likely that he will serve the term and voters can decide his fate in November 2021, Hayden said.It’s also unclear that a recall would be successful. Many citizens on social media and in public meetings expressed a “give him a chance” attitude. Reyes said that was “problematic” and questioned if those residents would feel the same if a Latin Kings gang member were appointed to the commission.In the meantime, Bolles is helping make decisions about the minutiae that are part of running a small town. Fennville will soon need to replace its aerator, and it’s considering selling a city-owned building to a medical marijuana company. At a recent meeting, Bolles suggested the city consider live-streaming commission meetings as a measure to promote open government.Though Fennville’s Latino population isn’t regularly politically active, it can be mobilized when there’s an issue that affects it, and Bolles is one of those, Reyes said. He expects that Fennville will “get him out” of office in 2021.If there’s a silver lining to the controversy, it’s that residents have gotten to know each other as they discuss it, Reyes said, and that’s “the only way that racism goes away”.“It’s gotten people together because we don’t want that in our town, we have to live with each other, and we have to learn that we aren’t bad people, “ he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110065117a9cf3f154b0dd976cd75aefbb779767/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44eaa9b2fc8f25348865dbee9401c30f","title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"Become part of our new video project documenting the impact of the outbreak across the UKFor 10 years, the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series has been about getting out into communities, giving voice to ordinary people, and trying to find a new way of covering politics and current affairs.

After a phone consultation with her GP she was diagnosed with a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics.She began self-isolation last Monday in Manchester, where she lives, but moved to her cottage in Wales on Sunday. “I’m one of the fortunate ones,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation for elderly people. The majority of us live productive lives and hope that society will take care of us when we are older, but we appear to have been abandoned by the health service and the government.“I’ve finished the course of antibiotics and now I just hope it goes. I’ve been putting Vicks on my chest and taking menthols. I’m quite determined.”O’Neill has been trying to support the people she works with from home. “We offer a lot of activities like horse riding, crafts, etc. Some of those won’t be possible now but we are trying to find ways to deliver other services using video.“I’ve been reading a lot and am nearly caught up with the programmes I’ve missed. At the moment I’m watching Hidden. I have three children and eight grandchildren and I’m actually trying to stop the social contact. When they all try and call it’s the end of the day before I know it.”John, who works as a bicycle courier in Manchester, decided to self-isolate on Saturday after waking up with a cough, fever and shortness of breath. “I wanted to be cautious as my job involves visiting people who might be vulnerable to coronavirus.“I messaged the supply company and they disabled my account for seven days, so I’m unable to work,” said the 24-year-old. “This wouldn’t normally be a problem but they have funds available for people who have coronavirus, but they’re not available unless you get medically tested.”As people were not getting tested for the virus unless they had been admitted to hospital John feared some people in the gig economy may not have access to the funds they need. “It makes sense as it prevents fraud but it’s a very difficult time,” he said.John said he reduces social isolation by talking to people all day on platforms such as Discord, where gaming communities can chat and share their screens while playing. “Not talking to real people can be difficult because you struggle to validate whether your thoughts are valid,” he said. “Hearing people’s voices makes you feel human and it’s a good way of trying to maintain social connections without social contact.“I live alone and one problem is that I don’t tend to remember what day it is. We’re so used to doing things that define our time off work that being at home means not having that shared experience.“I’m anticipating going back to work soon though, as people need food delivered, and there could be someone who is reliant on me.”Rosie,* who works in an office in London, has been in self-isolation for over a week. “I filled in the 111 questionnaire online and it advised me to call my GP,” she said. “I could only get through to a receptionist who advised me to go to the pharmacy, which I didn’t think was a good idea because I had a sore throat and was coughing.“I’m lucky enough to get two weeks’ sick leave from my workplace and my colleagues are supportive and understanding,” said the 37-year-old who is at home with her husband, who works in finance in IT. “My husband’s employer has been pushing for me to get tested but I can’t.”Rosie has been too unwell to do anything but rest at home. “I don’t need to think about how to pass the time as I’m actually sick. I feel tired and weak so I don’t want to do anything. Passing the time is not a big problem.”Andrew Moscrop, 42, works as a GP in Oxford, and has been in self-isolation since Friday after his temperature rose to 38.6C. “My fever resolved over the weekend,” he said. “Any other time I would go back to work as normal, but I can’t.”Moscrop contacted 111, Public Health England, the local health protection agency and the John Radcliffe hospital in the hope of being tested. “The advice was the same. Stay at home. It’s quite frustrating as at the end of the day you just want to do your job.“We are facing an escalating caseload and the government has talked of drafting in retired clinicians. Surely we should be testing frontline health workers so that, if negative, they can return to work promptly after an illness?”Moscrop’s partner, who also works in the health service, has also had to self-isolate along with their young child. “It’s become a bigger issue than we thought,” he said. “The government’s advice doesn’t seem entirely thought through as there’s nothing to say this won’t happen again later down the line.“We need to remain fairly pragmatic about it. We’re surrounded by fields so I took the little one out for a walk and a breath of fresh air. Soon I’ll have to pop out for food. I won’t wear a mask but I’ll just nip in as quickly as possible and use self-checkouts. My partner looked at getting food delivered but the available dates were quite far into the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47cae858e7397f8ed4bf6e2c4da00f46102ac994/0_62_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946102312972887f99b4ed44c1715b4e","title":"behave or face strict coronavirus lockdown germans told","story":"German citizens could be confined to their homes from Monday if people do not act responsiblyItaly and Spain have both reported their biggest single-day death tolls from the coronavirus as Germany’s 83 million citizens were warned they would be confined to their homes on Monday if they fail to behave responsibly this weekend.As Europe’s governments ramp up already draconian restrictions to curb the coronavirus, authorities in Rome on Friday announced 5,986 new cases and a record 627 new deaths, raising the totals to 47,021 infections and 4,032 fatalities.In Spain, the death toll rose to 1,002, a highest-ever increase of 235 in 24 hours. The latest statistics showed 19,980 confirmed cases across the country, more than a third in Madrid. Army specialists are to help disinfect care homes after the virus claimed more than 50 lives at elderly care facilities across the region.The army, already deployed in northern Italy to help move bodies as funeral services are overwhelmed, will also be used to help police the lockdown in Lombardy, regional president Attilio Fontana said. “The request to use the army is accepted and 114 soldiers will be on the ground,” Fontana said. “It is not enough, but it’s positive.”Helge Braun, Angela Merkel’s chief of staff, warned that a near-total lockdown – as in force in Italy, Spain and France – could soon be necessary in Germany. “We will look at the behaviour of the people this weekend,” Braun told Spiegel magazine.“Saturday is a decisive day, and we will keep a close eye on that.” The chancellor would hold a conference call with state premiers on Sunday, he said.The epidemic has infected more than 255,000 people worldwide and killed more than 10,400, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Italy on Thursday overtook China as the centre of the biggest outbreak, with authorities in Beijing on Friday reporting no new cases of domestic transmission for the second day running.Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, said the virus appears to be less deadly for younger people but warned that data from Italy indicated the fatality rate is twice as high for men across all age groups. “No one is immune,” she said. “We know it’s highly contagious to everyone.” Mexico and the US announced plans to sharply limit travel over their busy shared border as part of efforts to control the outbreak.As Spanish health authorities warned the peak of the crisis was still a few days away, frontline care workers described beleaguered hospitals operating near capacity and struggling with severe shortages of protective gear such as masks and gloves.“The current situation in hospitals in Madrid is critical,” said Ángela Hernández of the Association of Doctors and Professionals in Madrid. “The healthcare system is in a state of alarm.” Spain’s health minister has promised reinforcements, including medical students and recently retired physicians.In the UK all cafes, pubs, restaurants, gyms and other similar venues were ordered to close from Friday evening for the foreseeable future, and the government followed some other European countries in saying that it would pay a large proportion of workers’ wages.Belgium, which entered lockdown on Wednesday, on Friday reported its biggest daily rise in number of deaths since the beginning of the epidemic. Sixteen more people had died from the virus, the health ministry said, bringing the total to 37, with more than 2,000 cases.As in many European countries, schools, kindergartens, bars, nightclubs and non-essential shops have been closed in most parts of Germany and people urged to avoid unnecessary social contact in a bid to avoid a full-scale lockdown.But people are still socialising outside, some even organising “corona parties”. The leaders of Germany’s states warned mandatory confinement would be next. “Unless everyone fundamentally changes their behaviour, we won’t avoid tougher measures and sanctions,” said the Baden-Württemberg premier, Winfried Kretschmann.The country’s largest state, Bavaria, led the way on Friday, instituting a lockdown from midnight. “We are not locking Bavarians in but we are winding down public life almost completely,” the state premier, Markus Söder, said.Beyond Europe, more than 1.2 million Iranians ignored pleas by the government, clerics and local authorities to stay at home, taking to the country’s roads at the start of Iranian new year. Iran on Friday reported 149 new deaths, making a total of 1,433 and 19,644 confirmed cases in all. South Africa said its confirmed cases had risen to 202, the most in the sub-Saharan region, while Tunisia announced a lockdown.In the US, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, ordered all workers in non-essential businesses to stay home and banned gatherings statewide, while California’s population of 40 million experienced their first day under lockdown.President Trump said US authorities were aiming to fast-track the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – synthetic forms of quinine, used to treat malaria for centuries – for use as a coronavirus treatment.Both Italy and France have said this week that they will extend their restrictions and may tighten them further as the number of deaths on the continent continues to rise.In Austria, which has reported more than 2,200 coronavirus cases and six deaths, the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said on Friday that the signs were encouraging, but the country must continue to “stick with the measures” it had taken earlier. “Hold tight,” Kurz said. “We must not slow down.”In France, which on Friday reported 12,612 cases 450 deaths, President Emmanuel Macron said the country was only at the beginning of the crisis. “We are right at the start,” Macron said. “We have taken exceptional measures to absorb this first wave, but we’ve started a race against the virus. We must react strongly, and reorganise ourselves continually. We need to anticipate.”On Friday, authorities reminded people that exercise should be confined to 20-30 minutes in close proximity to home and alone, adding that they should only leave home once a day, choosing between, for example, shopping and exercise.Police would step up security checks in Paris train stations from Friday, a spokesman said, as the country further escalated its lockdown measures. Like anyone else in France stopped by police without documentation to justify their presence outside their homes, rail passengers will face a fine of €135 (£123). The mayor of Nice imposed a curfew starting from 8pm local time, going a step further than the national lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4abc4c919ef5efa5943a2fd81183ee9167217ae2/0_1351_2186_1312/master/2186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30051bd13432c023f4618d9e1c9244ae","title":"coronavirus impossible mother tirade remote schooling","story":"Israeli tells her children’s teachers, ‘Enough – it’s not working’ in an Instagram videoParents of school-aged children who are frustrated with being forced by coronavirus to supervise their education for potentially months on end have found their champion in a very cross Israeli mother.She rails on Instagram that, “It’s not working this distance learning thing. Seriously, it’s impossible, it’s crazy!”“You’ve finished us off - it’s only the second day! If we don’t die of corona, we’ll die of distance learning!” she shouts into the camera in a 90-second rant posted on Instagram.“One of my daughter’s teachers is living in a dream world if he thinks she’ll get up at 8am to see him on screen. 8am she only just manages to roll over in bed. Where do you get off?” she says. The woman, who says she has four children, complains that schools are asking too much of parents who are running from “one child to the other – here’s science, here’s math – forget it! And how am I supposed to know all those things? Now our children will find out how dumb we are… How am I supposed to know how to transform an improper fraction?“The music teacher of my youngest sent over a musical score this morning. What am I going to do with that information? What, have I got some band in the house? I can’t read music. Just one second, let me pull out my clarinet and help my son with his score. Enough guys, teachers, dial it down with the expectations.”It raised the issue of the extra stress placed on parents – as well as on children – by schools around the world closing due to coronavirus. “The kid’s fine, he’s on his cellphone all day. I’m falling to pieces,” the mother in the video says.The closure of schools has been one of the most contentious measures introduced – or not – by governments in their efforts to fight the coronavirus. More than 70 countries have made the decision to shut down schools in the hope of reducing the spread of the virus.On Wednesday, Boris Johnson announced that schools across the UK were to close indefinitely and that A-level and GCSE exams would not take place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

There were 1,237 new infections in the past 24 hours and 149 new deaths. The number of new infections is a record high for a single day, and the number of deaths is the same as the day before.Every layer of Iranian society – from clerical to army, as well as local government – had urged people to stay at home for the new year, a time when Iranians traditionally travel to see friends and family and celebrate the coming of spring.Alireza Raisi, the deputy health minister, said unless Iran got a grip on the crisis in the next two weeks, the country would be struggling with the disease for six months.Iranian ministers appear to be wary of imposing compulsory France-style quarantines, despite the rising death toll, because the government does not have the resources to provide welfare payments to low-income workers. Five former health ministers had written to the health ministry urging them to take more radical steps.The government has closed schools, universities and shrines, banned religious and cultural gatherings, but has not announced a ban on traffic. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, continued his diplomatic drive to ease US sanctions and spoke to Toshimitsu Motegi, the Japanese foreign minister, after Japan contributed $23m (£19.5m) to help Iran.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director of the World Health Organization, told a Lebanese broadcaster that Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, had agreed to ease some of the US sanctions covering banking to allow more medicines to reach Iran. But Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iranian affairs told reporters this week. “Our policy of maximum pressure on the regime continues,” he told reporters. “US sanctions are not preventing aid from getting to Iran.”Iran claims that American promises that medicines and medical equipment are exempt from sanctions are untrue. International banks, wary of US fines, will not permit the transfer of Iran’s financial resources stored in other countries into a Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement (SHTA), a new humanitarian channel agreed between the Swiss government and the US on 27 February.Despite the tensions between the US and Iran, Michael White, a US citizen jailed by the Iranians three years ago has been released on medical grounds, and is staying at the US embassy in Tehran.

They have ranged from public-broadcast-style announcements from Arnold Schwarzenegger to unusual beauty tips from January Jones and digital singalongs with Gal Gadot and friends.Some celebrities’ content has been altruistic and, from a public health perspective at least, helpful, focusing on practical guidelines. Gloria Gaynor, for instance, posted to TikTok a video of herself lip-synching to I Will Survive while lathering up .I believe simply, frequently, properly washing your hands can go a long way toward accomplishing what’s best for my fellow man“We’re all in this crisis together,” Gaynor told the . “I for one want to do what’s best for myself, my family and my fellow man. I want to make sure I’m doing what I can to encourage other people to do the same and that is the reason for my TikTok video. I believe simply, frequently, properly washing your hands can go a long way toward accomplishing that.“For generations, I Will Survive has become the anthem of the world, to give hope, encouragement and inspiration, and I will continue to make sure that happens.”Mariah Carey also washed her hands to a song from her back catalogue: she and her children posted a video to TikTok of themselves washing their hands to a remix of her 1995 number 1 Fantasy.On Thursday, the American singer JoJo posted a reworked version of her song Leave (Get Out), changing lyrics to give an instructional message the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US would be proud of. Foregrounded by a bowl piled high with shiny lemons, she chides younger viewers who may not be taking isolation warnings seriously: “Tell me why you’re acting so confused when the CDC laid it out for you. Come on I know you’re not dumb to go behind my back and hit the barshows how immature you really are keep exposure to a minimum.”The Pussy Cat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger took the opportunity to promote her band’s new single, React, to wash her hands while singing along dressed in latex.Other celebrities have been offering lifestyle tips specific to their age group. The 72-year-old Schwarzenegger has been posting advice focused on how fellow over-65s can stay fit and well.In one, he poses in front of a giant mural of himself in his flexing heyday while explaining the benefits of cycling as a self-isolation-friendly exercise option. More recently he has extolled the stay-at-home message from in his whirlpool bath while smoking a cigar.January Jones’ Instagram video of her “detox bath” falls into a more corona-adjacent than practical class of celebrity produced content. The former Mad Men actor’s beauty routine is quarantine friendly by dint of being time-consuming. In it she stirs lavender bubbles, baking soda, organic-apple cider vinegar and two scoops of sea salt into a bath tub. One person on Twitter called it a “thrush cauldron”, while another described the video as “January Jones teaching how to turn your coochie into salt \u0026amp vinegar crisps”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5853159ffb46df50200f838a4e6767e6782b9902/0_176_5670_3402/master/5670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0756e7cb189d9919b6550a247b9703d4","title":"social distancing could needed uk autumn report shows coronavirus","story":"Government documents show thinking behind approach to dealing with coronavirusStrict social distancing measures may need to remain in place until the autumn to have the required impact in controlling the Covid-19 epidemic in the UK, according to government documents that reveal the thinking behind its approach to the crisis.The documents, published online on Friday, give an extraordinary insight into the projected toll of the pandemic, the tactics that government advisers believe will be most effective in containing the spread of the virus and how messaging has been carefully framed to so the public accepts the need for unprecedented changes to daily life.In a consensus statement on the overall strategy being deployed, the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) suggests the UK would need to alternate between “periods of more and less strict social distancing measures” to have a plausible chance of keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity. “These would need to be in place for at least most of a year,” it concludes.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties.In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as:Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.Yes. China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 19 March, more than 219,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 8,900 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.The advisory group also stresses the need to promote a sense of collectivism in a modern-day spin on “Keep Calm and Carry On”. “All messaging should reinforce a sense of community, that ‘we are all in this together’. This will avoid increasing tensions between different groups,” the documents say.In papers that date from mid-February to the present, the group also considers issues ranging from public disorder to the psychology of self-isolation and potential social impacts of school closures. One paper outlines the potential for unintended consequences and the need to be clear about the purpose of school closures to prevent children from continuing to mix or grandparents taking on childcare responsibilities. Some social and workplace norms will need to be rapidly overturned. For instance, for many healthcare workers it is the norm that people continue to work when unwell. “It will be important to make it socially unacceptable to attend work or school if unwell,” the documents say. “To avoid the risk of stigma, ‘voluntary quarantine’ should be portrayed as an act of altruistic civic duty.”An assessment of the chances of public disorder, drawn up in February, concluded that while “large-scale rioting” seemed unlikely, any disorderwas likely to be generated by anger at the government’s response rather than the direct effects of the pandemic.One 12 March paper on public expectations about measures to stop public gatherings noted there was general support for the move, especially as people could see this happening abroad – and that if policy was not properly explained, people might not trust the government, potentially increasing the risk of disorder.“Acting in a way that does not meet expectations poses a risk that a section of the public will view government actions as incompetent or not in the public’s best interests,” it says. “It may also be taken as signifying that the situation is not expected to be severe for the UK. This could have knock-on implications for public attitudes to other recommendations made by government.”It adds that “the risk of public disorder would be higher if there was a perception that the government’s response was not competent”.Other issues that could cause tensions, it says, include a possible lack of certain goods such as hand sanitisers, not enough police officers because of sickness, and police efforts seen as unfair, for example limiting access to food or healthcare.Particularly, a lack of police numbers “could lead to a rise in opportunistic crime by those who are already antagonistic towards the police”, the paper says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cdd19ceb9e5ed13fd8e005ab57e7f643e60cf39/0_197_5307_3183/master/5307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4eb7e3b41be2df0b57955bb8c40f762","title":"biggest story how journalists coping covid 19","story":"Some reporters are under enormous pressure as the coronavirus news pours in relentlessly – while for others, work has dried up completelyAs the coronavirus pandemic unfolds, the constant stream of news can feel overwhelming. But for the journalists reporting on the outbreak who can’t switch off, the personal toll is becoming apparent.On Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday morning, newsreader Diana Speed was audibly emotional after reporting on an interview with Ken Finlayson, whose wife, Kimberley, 52, contracted coronavirus and died in Bali following surgery.Elsewhere, on the US television network MSNBC, news anchor Rachel Maddow broke down on live television while paying tribute to her colleague Larry Edgeworth, who died of coronavirus.Journalists delivering public service broadcasting have been identified as key workers along with health workers and those providing essential public services, meaning they can still send their children to school whilst they go to work. Many feel under enormous pressure to make sure that the public are getting the right information about the outbreak.For Rob Osbourne, the National Correspondent for ITV Wales, looking after his family while continuing to report on the virus is putting him, like many journalists and others in frontline professions, under pressure. He was distracted in an editorial meeting earlier this week because his mother was repeatedly phoning him with questions about coronavirus. His mother has underlying health conditions and cares for his uncle, who has Down syndrome.That was when Rob realised that telling his family’s story was an opportunity to help others across the country struggling to understand the rapidly changing information coming out of government. In the resulting video, which has had more than 135,000 views on Twitter, Rob talks to his mum about the difference between social distancing and self-isolation, and explains why he can’t come near her at the moment.“The fact that the virus is likely to impact the country for weeks or months to come means it is important that journalists do not burn out. This is a marathon. We’re in this for the long haul,” said Osbourne.“I’ve always been able to separate the story from my own feelings. I’ve covered some horrific stories. But with this, it’s the personal element. For me yesterday it was that my uncle doesn’t understand why he can’t go out because he has Down syndrome. It’s normally me who takes him out but I can’t do it. That’s when I took a deep breath.“It’s going to be tough. We’re professionals, but this is going to affect us all. And I think the public appreciate that. The human touch is appreciated.”One said: “I am a sport journalist left with no work at all as a result of the near-blanket cancellation of all sport. As a husband and father, I still have considerable monthly outgoings – just limited funds with which to meet my responsibilities.”Another sport journalist who has lost most of his work said: “I have a mortgage and children. My children finish school and nursery on Friday, yet we have been told we will still be charged the monthly fee for the nursery. Thank god my wife is still working, but her own job could be in jeopardy despite her boss reassuring her she is OK for now.”Hannah Storm, director of the Ethical Journalism Network, who has been working for the past decade in journalism safety, wrote: “News organisations have had to reinvent decades of working practices in days. Large numbers of journalists are self-isolating or quarantined, travel has been reduced between countries and within countries. As Covid-19 spreads, so do the levels of anxiety around what we know and don’t know, who and what to trust, and how to stay safe – physically and mentally – as journalists working in uncertain times.”The BBC told the : “Covid-19 is a harrowing story for everyone, including our staff. The BBC takes seriously its responsibility to support employees during this time and there are support structures in place to ensure we do this effectively. We are determined to carry on covering the story for the public and will continue to do so for as long as it takes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus 21 march at a glance evening","story":"A summary of today’s biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The death toll in the UK rose to 233 on Saturday after NHS England said a further 53 Covid-19 patients had died.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the symptoms to look for as experiencing either:About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 20 March, more than 275,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 11,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has seen over 4,000 deaths. More than 86,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 across the United Kingdom.

Buying more than you need means others may be left without.”He stressed the message that “there is enough food available” and ruled out government rationing, saying supermarket limits were already in place.“I don’t think it’s necessary for the government to intervene further to say what an appropriate limit is.”Dickinson said there was now £1bn worth of food in people’s houses that had not yet been used.Powis appealed to people to consider NHS frontline staff as many had been faced with empty shelves by the time they finished their shifts.He referred to a video of a nurse, Dawn Bilbrough, that took off on social media on Friday. She filmed herself in her car, exhausted and crying, having just come out of a supermarket where she was unable to buy any fresh fruit or vegetables.“I’m a critical care nurse and I’ve just finished 48 hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next 48 hours,” she said. “Those people who are just stripping the shelves of basic foods, you just need to stop it because it’s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest and just stop it, please.”Asked about possible government intervention to restrict food purchases, Eustice said: “The reality is that most of the supermarkets are already, of their own accord, putting limits on certain items so I don’t think it is necessary or appropriate for the government to dictate this.”He said people needed to “calm down” and “only buy what they need”, and that it was for retailers to agree what the appropriate limit was on goods such as toilet paper.“All of the major retailers are working together and exercising their own judgment on where it’s appropriate to put limits – item limits – on certain issues,” he said.“Toilet roll is one, where, for reasons that are not really known, there was a spike early on, despite the fact that toilet roll is made in this country and they are able to expand production very quickly.”The press conference followed a meeting between Johnson and supermarket bosses about panic buying on Saturday.There have been growing calls from MPs, academics, charities and those who work with vulnerable people to ensure food and other essentials are reaching those most in need.This weekend, 150 cross-party MPs and peers wrote to the government asking it to “show the direction and leadership necessary” to ensure food supplies were available for all NHS, emergency and essential workers.Charities working with more vulnerable groups told the Observer they were becoming increasingly concerned that many people were facing real food shortages because they had no access to stores, and online shopping slots were booked weeks in advance. Many of those who could access food were struggling to pay for the few things that were available because the cheaper options were often the ones that had disappeared from shelves.The Salvation Army’s leader in the UK and Ireland, Commissioner Anthony Cotterill, said: “We urge the government to bring all the major retailers together to develop a coordinated approach. Measures are urgently needed, in both urban and rural areas, to help older people and key workers access the groceries they need to remain healthy.”Age UK expressed similar concerns, saying it was “deeply worrying” that the problem of stockpiling was not going away despite the measures supermarkets have taken to try to address the issues, such as introducing pensioner-only hours in stores.The stockpiling showed no sign of abating this weekend. Before 6am on Saturday, hundreds of shoppers were filmed queueing round the block at major stores, including all the way around the car park at a Tesco in New Malden, south London.Steve Livington, 58, who lives alone in Peacehaven, West Sussex, is a wheelchair user and said he always shopped online.“Last week I went to order my Tesco delivery and there was nothing for three weeks, and then the same for Sainsbury’s and similarly for Asda,” he said.Asked what he thought of the government’s call for greater responsibility, he said: “Words like those I sadly feel will do little to calm the irrational fears driving most of those panic buyers. Akin to the old adage ‘show don’t tell’, what’s needed is action not words.”Dr Alexander Trautrims, an expert in logistics and supply chains at Nottingham University Business School said: “Relaxing the restrictions on retail logistics are well overdue. Making it easier for supermarkets and the food sector to share resources and knowledge by waiving competition rules temporarily is another logical step. It is hard to believe that such measures were not part of a response plan prepared a long time ago sitting, ready to be implemented, in a government drawer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1efe966f149190ee8b0a7cbb5325e088cb0cc369/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4b8547d3cdc49afcf3d3c40b1804361","title":"coronavirus what happens to lungs covid 19","story":"Respiratory physician John Wilson explains the range of Covid-19 impacts, from no symptoms to severe illness featuring pneumoniaWhat became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc1a4c333ea4955d5f365b35bb0c56a84749af65/0_96_4866_2920/master/4866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d014c04396b2a4360f9ed0a78c34bbc","title":"man runs marathon on 7 metre balcony during french lockdown","story":"Elisha Nochomovitz wanted to pay tribute to medics and show it’s possible to stay fit at homeIn the age of Covid-19 confinement, Elisha Nochomovitz has figured out a way to keep occupied by running a marathon on his balcony.Nochomovitz ran 42.2km (26.2 miles) back and forth, never leaving his 7 metre-long (23 feet) balcony.He saw it as a physical and mental challenge, and also shared images of the feat online as a way to extend his support to medical personnel who were doing an “exceptional job”, he told Associated Press from his apartment in Balma, a suburb of the southern French city of Toulouse.Like athletes who ran around their Wuhan apartments or cyclists who found ways to train in their locked-down Abu Dhabi hotel rooms, Nochomovitz wanted to show that it’s possible to stay fit as virus containment measures tighten around the world.He also wanted to lighten the mood. “It was about launching a bit of a crazy challenge and bringing a bit of humour, to de-dramatise the confinement situation,” he said.He didn’t exactly make record time. It took him six hours and 48 minutes. He got nauseous and worried the neighbours would complain about the pounding of his footsteps. But he did it.Technically, the French authorities are still allowing people to go outside for exercise such as running, if they fill out and sign a form explaining their reasons for leaving their homes.The number of joggers on French streets has multiplied in recent days, amid exceptionally balmy weather. And that has authorities worried that too many people are still out on the streets, threatening efforts to contain the virus.“If everyone thinks the same way and does the same thing, we will all find ourselves outside and that won’t help anything, and the message that we need to stay confined at home will have had no impact,” said Nochomovitz.He said he had been training for a marathon, adding: ““I needed to assure myself that I could still run 40km.”He lost track of how many laps he did, but his pedometer kept track while his mind wandered. “I thought about many things, what’s going to happen, when I see that the world has stopped, sports, economy, finance,” he said. “We learned in history about wars between nations, men and weapons, but this is something that is beyond us.”He especially thought about medics, which he described as the real everyday heroes”.He had crucial support in his challenge. “I had my girlfriend here who was giving me drinks and M\u0026ampMs.”Outside, some onlookers stared in confusion.

These include:The letter from MPs, drafted by the Labour MP Anna McMorrin and addressed to Tory MP Alok Sharma, the business secretary, says: “A crisis of this magnitude calls on all of us to do whatever it takes to ensure no one is left behind. As members of parliament, we call on you to show leadership and urgently resolve this matter, whether that involves ringfencing supplies or shopping time for essential workers.”The issue was brought to the attention of millions of people on Friday when a video of a nurse, Dawn Bilbrough, went viral. She filmed herself in her car, exhausted and crying, having just come out of a supermarket where she had been unable to buy any fresh fruit or vegetables.“I’m a critical care nurse and I’ve just finished 48 hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next 48 hours,” she said. “Those people who are just stripping the shelves of basic foods you just need to stop it because it’s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest and just stop it, please.”However, so far this seems to have had little effect. Before 6am on Saturday hundreds of shoppers were filmed by a drone queueing round the block at supermarkets including all the way round the car park at a Tesco in New Malden. Other images posted on social media continued to show shelves stripped bare of essential goods and supplies such as milk, eggs, meat, toilet rolls and pasta.Steve Livington, 58, who lives alone in Peacehaven, is in a wheelchair. He has a form of muscular dystrophy and always shops online. “Last week I went to order my Tesco delivery and there was nothing for three weeks, and then the same for Sainsbury’s and similarly for Asda,” he said. “I don’t have any local friends or family who can help and so I’m now starting to be really worried.”Hannah Graham, a local group coordinator for the single-parent family charity Gingerbread, is self-isolating with her two children, six and nine, in Northwich. “I am still managing to get some food delivered online but all the own-brand goods I usually get because I am on a limited budget are now being substituted for premium brands,” she said. “I’m now less worried about the virus in the weeks ahead and more worried about being able to provide all the food and essentials my children and I need.”Alexander Trautrims, an expert in logistics and supply chains at Nottingham University business school said it was understandable people were stockpiling in times of uncertainty but that there was no chance of the country running out of food. “There is enough supply in the system but the demand patterns have changed so much there may be local shortages while retailers react to these,” he said.He said there needed to be stronger assurances from government to get this message across and that supermarket actions, instead of being reassuring, created panic as they were suggestive of a shortage.A government spokesperson said: “We are in regular contact with the food industry to ensure it is well prepared to deal with a range of scenarios. Retailers are continuing to monitor their supply chains and taking all the necessary steps to ensure consumers have the food and supplies they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d45d2bd68a29e34a7e664d5cbad13af16c13a3c/109_264_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7250251e15beb46af121b299f383e9b","title":"nice issues emergency coronavirus guidelines for uk doctors and nurses","story":"First three guidelines consider patients in critical care, having kidney dialysis and cancer treatmentGuidelines to help UK doctors and nurses know the best course of treatment for patients amid the coronavirus pandemic have been published.The first three “rapid guidelines” from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) consider patients in critical care, those having kidney dialysis and people being treated for cancer.There have been concerns the UK does not have enough intensive care beds to cope with the number of people who will fall ill, and that the country could end up in a similar situation to Italy, where doctors have been forced to choose which patients get a bed.Recent footage from inside the main hospital in Bergamo, the country’s main affected area, showed doctors and nurses rushing between patients in a packed ward, with other people on trolleys in a corridor.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Earlier this week, the health select committee chairman, Jeremy Hunt, asked whether the “absolutely heartbreaking” scenes from northern Italy would happen in England and about guidance for medics.In response, the NHS national medical director, Stephen Powis, said the health service and government were doing “everything we possibly can not to get into that circumstance”.Powis said doctors made clinical decisions every day and “what we want to be able to do is to support doctors to make those continued decisions on the basis that they are currently making them”.The new guidelines, which were published on Saturday and are the fastest ever to be produced by Nice, say all patients admitted to hospital should still be assessed as usual for frailty “irrespective of Covid-19 status”.For those who test positive for the virus, decisions about them being admitted to critical care should consider the medical benefit, taking into account the likelihood of the person’s recovery.In its guidance on clinical decision-making, Nice advises medics to “base decisions on admission of inidual adults to critical care on the likelihood of their recovery, taking into account the likelihood that a person will recover from their critical care admission to an outcome that is acceptable to them”.For cancer patients, medics will need to balance the risks of the patient not being treated in the usual way against the risk of them becoming seriously ill through coronavirus due to a weakened immune system, the guidelines state.Workarounds could include treatment being offered at different locations, patients having longer breaks between treatments and delivering treatments in different forms, the document adds.Kidney dialysis patients suspected of having the virus could have their treatment delayed until their test results are known.The guidance also recommends transport services are checked and alternative arrangements made where necessary, if the normal provider refuses to transport patients confirmed to have Covid-19.Further updated guidelines are expected in the coming weeks on symptom management, radiotherapy patients and those with rheumatoid arthritis.Nice said it would make its guidance available online so other countries can see the approach the UK is taking to tackle the virus and care for patients in the NHS.Paul Chrisp, director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said the three guides had been produced within a week – when usually one set can take up to two years to compile.He said: “We have done these very rapidly so it’s not our usual process, although it’s been as robust as we could in a very short timeframe.Duncan Young, professor of intensive care medicine at the University of Oxford, said it was clear the NHS’s critical care staffing levels and beds would be under serious pressure in the weeks ahead.He said: “This advice is written in part for non-critical care doctors and covers when to seek advice from critical care doctors and what information the critical care team will need.“Implicit in this guidance is that human resources (critical care team members) and physical resources (suitably equipped critical beds) will be extremely stretched in the coming weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef34efaab0d04fc0e02f472a857d985228812bb/0_47_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=271f4472c4ba682ff01c99a4fe3ce3ce","title":"pakistan

also asked people to self-quarantine for at least another 45 days as the country reported its third coronavirus death, with confirmed cases rising to 534.Authorities in Bangladesh tightened border controls, while Sri Lankan police arrested more than two dozen people for violating a nationwide curfew.The region, home to 1.9 billion people, appears to have been less badly affected than other parts of the world, but the rate of new infections in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka has accelerated.As a whole, the region has registered 869 coronavirus cases and seven deaths.A senior Indian health ministry official in New Delhi said India had tested some 15,00 people in about 70 state-run labs, one of the lowest testing rates in the world.Bracing for the inevitable, India is increasing the number of tests being offered.“At this point we really don’t know what is the extent of the spread,” the health ministry official said, on condition of anonymity.Officials are concerned that countries in the region will prove particularly susceptible to the virus, given poor health facilities and infrastructure in many areas.Indian Railways, which carries more than 30 million passengers every day, said some people who had tested positive for coronavirus had travelled by train – forcing officials to track down fellow passengers.RD Bajpai, a spokesman for India’s national railway system, urged people not to travel.In the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, inmates at the largest jail launched a violent protest against authorities for banning visitors due to the virus.“An attempt was made by inmates to set fire to the jail after the convicts fought with the staff but the situation is under control,” said an official at the Dum Dum prison, adding that police fired teargas to quell the unrest.In neighbouring Bangladesh, jail authorities limited the number of visitors and banned the arrival of all flights from midnight except from China, Hong Kong and Thailand, after 20 people tested positive, a senior civil aviation official said.At Dhaka airport, authorities started marking the hands of passengers who had been instructed to follow home quarantine.In Sri Lanka, which has reported 72 confirmed cases, police arrested 30 people from various parts of the country for violating curfew, a police spokesman said, adding that the curfew has been imposed till Monday morning.Indians in urban centres were scrambling to buy essential commodities, ahead of a self-imposed day-long curfew on Sunday promoted by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to practise social isolation.India, the world’s second most-populous country, also plans to halt all incoming international flights to help stem the number of cases, which passed 271 on

Slovakia has reported 137 cases of Covid-19 this month and no deaths.The central European country of 5.5 million people is battling the coronavirus outbreak that has put Europe on lockdown, pressuring Matovič’s four-party coalition to speed up talks to form a government.The cabinet replaced a centre-left Smer party-led administration that has ruled the country through a period of economic growth since 2012, and for 12 of the last 14 years. Smer’s popularity has slipped since the 2018 murder of the investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancee led to huge street protests against alleged corruption that are still reverberating in the country.After the parties signed the coalition deal, Matovič said: “Bearing in mind our responsibility and the burden we received, that is the coronavirus pandemic, we have signed a deal so that we could make good on our promise to make Slovakia a country that all honest people could be proud of.”Matovič, 46, and his Ordinary People party (OLaNo) – known for publicity stunts to shine a light on alleged graft – won a quarter of the vote in the 29 February election.OLaNo will lead with three other parties: Sme Rodina (We are Family), a socially conservative and eurosceptic party SaS (Freedom and Solidarity), an economically liberal party and Za ľudí (For the People), a mildly conservative party led by the former president Andrej Kiska.

Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans – current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus’s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, including the UK, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on self-isolation and travel.The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two – the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy.In the UK, the medical advice is now that the household of anyone who develops a new persistent cough or high temperature should all stay at home for 14 days, keeping away from other people. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.You should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube – though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes.Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected.Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and will launch their trial imminently. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months “was not unreasonable to assume”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199820.1583937458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"counting hares under the spotlight","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland had an estimated 223,000 Irish hares in the winter of 201819. Picture: Michael VineyIn an early initiation into sheep-country nightlife, I was awoken on a winter night by a sudden blaze of light beyond the bedroom curtains. Peering out, I found a 4x4 parked opposite our gate and a mounted spotlight probing the rough hillside across the road.The gun patrol didn’t pause long. Failing to raise any foxy form or eye-glint among the rushes, the rifle was lowered and the sheep left to resume their digestive doze in the dark.Not all nocturnal spotlights have been so intently malign quite the contrary. Until recently, they also seemed the best way of counting Irish hares, always a challenging undertaking given the animal’s historical swings in population.Thus, a national survey in 2007 ided the countryside into mapped grid 10km squares and used a powerful spotlight “from point transects located along minor roads”. The hares are most active between dusk and midnight again in the half-light of dawn.The results were worth having but limited in their coverage: would the camera traps of so many TV wildlife films give a more thorough picture? An eight-strong cross-Border team assembled by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) set out to compare the two methods in a new national survey (Irish Wildlife Manual 113 at npws.ie).A pilot survey used a mobile “two million candlelight spot lamp” shone in two-minute bursts from along minor roads. The cameras, fixed at random to cover the same area, were strapped low on trees, bushes and fence posts and triggered by movement to record 15-second videos.After 4.3 survey hours, observers behind the mobile spotlight had recorded 84 inidual animals – hares, fox, badger and rabbits. In contrast over the same areas, 59,000 video hours from 351 cameras recorded 2,604 iniduals of 12 species, including 20 times more Irish hares, lots of farmland birds, and 1,800-odd rabbits (this from inadvertently fixing some cameras next to a warren).Then came the full camera survey, using 596 cameras deployed at random within 44 squares and yielding some 106,000 video hours – the equivalent of about 12 years of continuous observation. It found 253 hares, compared with nine in the spotlight pilot survey.Scaled up by the area of each geographic region, this estimated that the Republic had some 223,000 Irish hares in the winter of 201819. They were more numerous in the north and west but showed the widespread grassland distribution typical of the Irish species. Despite threats from farming, traffic and a new rabbit viral disease, its conservation status is reckoned favourable and stable.Arrays of camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring, especially to judge the impact of the new haemorrhagic disease. If the camera specified in the team’s report is the American “deer trail” camera I matched online, it retails at $160, complete with a year’s battery.Hi-tech ecology is already at the command of the NPWS in certain of the six-yearly checks on species that satisfy the EU’s long-standing habitats directives. Counting, say, a particular endangered plant on Ireland’s sand dunes still demands a pair of consultant botanists trudging up and down geometrically for hours and days, but a census of seals needs more costly attention.Recently in this column I speculated on the predatory appetite for seal meat of the orcas – killer whales – that we share with Scottish waters. New research from the University of Aberdeen has potentially linked the orcas to a dramatic decline in numbers of Scotland’s harbour seals, with numbers in Orkney and Shetland dropping by 40 per cent in five years.I suggested it might be necessary to check again on the numbers of Ireland’s harbour seals. But this overlooked a recent survey for the NPWS of both grey and harbour seals, using thermal imaging from the air. It was the third such nationwide survey in summer and was carried out by the Sea Mammal Research Unit of the University of St Andrews in 2017 and 2018.Flying in the peak harbour seal moult season in August and early September, the team’s helicopter carried a multi-camera, gyro-stabilised gimbal (you will want to know this) containing a laser range-finder, a colour HD digital video camera, a mid-wavelength thermal imaging video camera and a digital camera with a 300mm telephoto lens!Predictably, most harbour seals were hauled out in sheltered corners of the coast, while most large groups of grey seals kept to more exposed shores, rocky reefs and offshore islands. The harbour seals totalled 4,007 and the greys 3,698, the highest counts for both species in summer. Adjusting for the greys’ different time ashore in summer, they outnumber the harbour seals by two or three times."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209067.1584813109!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why are we having such spectacular sunsets it s all down to the light","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe sun sets over Lowertown, Rahugh in Co Westmeath on Friday evening. Photograph: INPHOJames CrombieDramatic sunsets which have draped vivid warm colours over Irish skies in recent evenings are set to continue, forecasters are predicting.Intense hues of yellow, orange and red have been lighting up dusk around the country, briefly distracting from the dark mood felt by many underneath the skies.So why are the sunsets and sunrises so dramatic at the moment.The country is enjoying a couple of relatively settled days and this dry, calm, still weather “scatters the light” molecules in a different way and also the changing directions of light rays, she said.“Our eyes are sensitive to the wavelengths in that and the different colours associated with different wavelengths, which bend in different directions.”Both at sunrise and sunset, light has to travel a greater distance to reach our eyes, than during the day, when it is more directly overheard.So more of the blue — that we see in a cloudless sky — gets filtered out. This reveals more of the warmer colours of the rainbow that make up light.Because we are coming into the spring equinox, there is also more sunlight and the sun is higher in the sky.“On Friday there were quite spectacular sunrises and and particularly sunsets around the country,” said Ms Ryan.“The east coast probably saw the best sunsets, as there was cloud rolling up from the south of the country.”And, says Ms Ryan, we can expect to see more of the same in the coming days, as an easterly airflow likely keeps the air dry and clear.“Eastern and southern counties and maybe inland could expect some fairly spectacular sunrises and sunsets to come,” she said.“Nice springy weather” is also on the way for most of the country over the next two to three days, with temperatures expected to jump into double digits.Following a cold Saturday - with the mercury hovering between 5 and 8 degrees - parts of the midlands and west could enjoy highs of 13 degrees from Sunday.It is forecast to be fresher in the east and south, with winds coming off the Irish and Celtic Seas, but temperatures should still rise to 11 and 12 degrees in parts.The conditions are expected to last until Tuesday when rain is predicted to move across the country."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Aiden CrawleyGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan has proposed that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister for Health Simon Harris remain in their jobs as part of a temporary national unity government.Mr Ryan outlined the proposal in a letter to all other party leaders in which he further elaborated on his party’s call for a national unity government to deal with the coronavirus crisis.However, some in Fine Gael have now raised the prospect of Mr Varadkar being Taoiseach first to continue dealing with the coronavirus crisis.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald on Friday said the idea of a national unity government should be examined but others, such as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have been cool on the proposal. *A Green Party spokesman said the proposal was intended to ensure there was no disruption in key departments and to also stimulate discussion. It is also understood Mr Ryan put no time limits on how long Mr Varadkar, Mr Coveney and Mr Harris would remain in place.Ms McDonald had previously downplayed the idea of a unity government but, in her latest comments, left the door open to it while still expressing some doubts.‘Respond quickly’“We need to look at every option,” she told Today FM. “The issue with a national unity government is how exactly would it work and would it be coherent enough to respond quickly.“That is the concern but, yes, there is merit of course in all of the political forces coming together because we all represent different sections of our people, whatever our views on other political matters.“It is one of the options on the table. I still think a better option would be a government for change that reflects the outcome of the last election but I don’t hold all of the cards in this and my concern and our concern at this time is to do the right thing for people and certainly that unity government option needs to be looked at, absolutely.”Sinn Féin sources also raised concerns about how the Dáil and Seanad will function by passing measures and by giving oversight to proposals to tackle the crisis,The issue of the appointment of 11 Senators by a new Taoiseach was also raised by those in Sinn Féin as an issue that may have to be dealt with. There is concern that no legislation can be passed by the Oireachtas once the incoming Seanad is elected until a new government is formed.‘National crisis’The two candidates for the leadership of Labour – Alan Kelly and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin – also downplayed the idea of a national unity government but raised the prospect of their party’s six TDs allowing a new government take office by either voting for it or abstaining. Both raised concerns, however, about moving ministers in the immediate future at a time of national crisis.Mr Ó Ríordáin said: “If two of the three power blocs in the house have an agreement to form a government and that government can lead us through this period, I think the Labour Party would be working with that government in facilitating without taking part in that government necessarily.”“If there is a government to be formed and it needs to facilitated, in the interests if the country, then the Labour Party as usual will put the country first and would have discussions on that.”* This article was amended on Saturday, March 21st, 2010.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Supermarkets and high street retailers pledge millions to help the needy during coronavirus pandemicCoronavirus diary: postcard from a locked-down ParisBritons \u0026#39should be ashamed\u0026#39 for stockpiling £1bn worth of food during coronavirus pandemicGermany \u0026#39planning £550bn rescue package for economy\u0026#39UK shutdown will need at least 90pc of people to obey it to be effective, pandemic adviser warnsRobert Graves: Writer of biopic drew on experiences of friends who suffered PTSD from Iraq WarMillions of faulty smart meters yet to be fixed\u0026#39We should get tested as regularly as we have our morning lattes to stop Corona\u0026#39, recommends Nobel Prize economistJoe Biden could make history by picking African-American woman as his vice presidentJohn Lewis and Pret a Manger close stores nationwide going beyond Government\u0026#39s coronavirus adviceGang members wearing \u0026#39coronavirus medical masks to disguise themselves\u0026#39 Parents hire tutors to help children get ahead for next year while schools are shutLoss of sense of smell and taste could be symptoms of the new coronavirusComment: If we’re not careful, we’ll be stuck with the subsidies we\u0026#39ve created over coronavirus for a very long timeUK lacks ability to mass produce coronavirus vaccine, experts warnCoronavirus private sector deal: 8,000 beds to take strain off NHSBritish couple felt \u0026#39forced\u0026#39 to go on coronavirus-stricken cruise after they were refused refund for £6k trip Elderly people urged to stay fit while in isolation with charity exercise regime Asia braces for second wave of infections from overseasWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"quarter uk adults strictly following governments coronavirus","story":"Only a quarter of the general public are strictly following the government’s coronavirus advice, according to a new poll.Just 23 per cent said they were following the official guidance to the letter, with a further two in five saying they were ‘mostly’ adhering to the instructions on self-isolation and social distancing.The poll by Savanta for the Daily  found that roughly three in four UK adults left the house between Monday and Wednesday, despite Boris Johnson’s plea for people to only undertake essential travel to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. Almost as many left the house on Wednesday as on Monday, when the Prime Minister announced the biggest shut down of the UK since the Second World War, urging people to work from home and stay away from pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other social gatherings.Asked whether they had left their house, 73 per cent said yes on Monday, rising to 75 per cent on Tuesday and down to 72 per cent on Wednesday.On Wednesday, 26 per cent said they had visited family and friends at their home or out and about - up from 20 per cent on Monday.There was also no significant increase in people self-isolating between Monday and Wednesday, with 17 per cent saying they were not leaving their house at the beginning of the week compared to 16 per cent two days later. Londoners and women were found to be most likely to self-isolate.The findings suggest that the majority of the public is not heeding the Prime Minister’s warnings that coronavirus could kill 250,000 people if they do not change their behaviour. Around two thirds of people have been watching the Prime Minister’s press conferences, either live or on catch-up later.Just under half (46 per cent) approve of how Mr Johnson is handling the outbreak, compared to a third (31 per cent) who disapprove. Similarly, 45 per cent approve of how Chancellor Rishi Sunak is handling the outbreak, although significantly fewer (16 per cent) disapprove. Over half (53 per cent) approve of the UK government’s handling the crisis. Nearly four in five (79 per cent) approve of how the NHS has reacted to the outbreak, while England’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty has a 56 per cent approval rating, and Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance has a 52 per cent approval rating. Only around 8 per cent disapprove of each of them.The poll found the public is growing increasingly anxious about coronavirus, with 70 per cent saying they were worried on Monday, rising to 74 per cent on Wednesday.Asked if their disposable income had decreased, one in five said yes on Monday, rising to over a third by Wednesdays.The findings came as Mr Johnson last night announced all entertainment venues would close and Mr Sunak announced a new coronavirus job retention scheme for employers to apply for an HMRC grant to cover 80 per cent of wages up to £2,500 a month.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph readers famous self isolators coping staying","story":"“I think you need to try to avoid your day meandering aimlessly and so I’ve started work on my self-isolation schedule, laying out activities and things I want to do.I decided to self isolate, I don’t have any symptoms but like to try for a week first.

In the 90s, there was an occasional one, but now there are more introspective men in their late 20s coming in with a little bit of puffiness wanting to have surgery, which I try to avoid because they usually have problems with their body image.“I would try to refer many of them to a psychologist. They can then assess them and look at underline anxiety images and that might be what they need.”Campaigners have warned that waking up in the middle of the night to check messages can negatively affect young people\u0027s moods and makes them look more tired the next day.A spokesperson for the Royal Society for Public Health said: “Taking a break from social media when in the bedroom or during sleeping hours can be a great way to ensure that social media use does not override a young person\u0027s ability to get a good night\u0027s sleep, which is a vital component to overall health and well-being.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"asia braces second wave infections us europe","story":"Hong Kong has warned of a surge in imported cases of coronavirus carried by travellers returning from overseas amid fears around Asia that success fighting the infection there could be short lived.Countries across the region that have had success in stamping out domestic transmission - like Taiwan and South Korea - are bracing for imported infections as people arrive from Europe and the United States, the new epicentres of the respiratory disease.Hong Kong, which has just 273 confirmed cases of coronavirus and four deaths, said the new wave of infections would likely lead to a community outbreak and pile pressure on the city\u0027s already stretched healthcare system.Some Asian nationas, like Taiwan and Malaysia, have sealed their borders to non-nationals, while most have slapped strict 14-day home or government quarantine restrictions on all arrivals.Hong Kong, which has seen a record surge in cases this week – mainly arriving from Europe, has introduced electronic bracelets for disembarking passengers at the airport. The wristband is connected to a phone app that allows the authorities to track the wearer’s location and any quarantine breaches. South Korea, which has managed to slow the spread of the disease after cases exploded in February, from Sunday at midnight will introduce a compulsory Covid-19 test for anyone entering the country from Europe.Last week the authorities warned that expats caught ignoring anti-coronavirus directions – including requests to be tested, treated or quarantined - could face deportation or an entry ban.China first reported imported infections in late February, and has since confirmed nearly 200, many of them Chinese expatriates fleeing coronavirus outbreaks around the world. Neighbourhood committees and police are conducting house calls to ensure people now self-isolating are abiding by the rules. Taiwan, an island of 23 million just 81 miles from China, has been widely praised for its tackling of the virus, but last week it saw cases more than double to 135, with most linked to arrivals from Europe and North Africa. The news has sparked a fresh round of public anxiety.Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese president, warned on Thursday that the next 14 days would be critical to virus prevention efforts and warned of “heavy fines” for hoarding. The health minister said the main focus would be on avoiding community spread of the disease. All arriving passengers at Taipei’s main Taoyuan airport have faced hours of queuing to undergo health screening and to ensure compliance with quarantine controls.  The authorities have warned that quarantine violations may result in huge fines and the offender’s name being publicised. Merle Hermanns, 20, a German backpacker who was mid-flight from Bangkok in Thailand when Taiwan announced new 14-day quarantine rules.At the airport she was ushered to a taxi stand assigned to quarantine cases where her luggage was disinfected and then taken to a government approved hotel.Stuck in a windowless room under lockdown, she said she was keeping positive by passing the time with Netflix and chatting to family and friends. The authorities check on her location every day. Peggy Wang, a Taiwanese American who arrived from New York on Thursday, is anxiously waiting out her quarantine period until April 3 at her elderly parents’ home at their insistence. She said she had confined herself to one bedroom, and only communicates with them by phone, disinfecting any doorknobs or surfaces she touches. Her parents wear face masks in the house. “We are like virus refugees now, trying to stay safe from the virus. I can only imagine what it would be like to be a refugee from a war. I feel for everyone,” she said. Asian governments are warning their citizens against fatigue and complacency in the long-term battle against the virus as the second round of infections begins. Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at Hong Kong’s City University, told the  that newly implemented quarantine rules should “reduce the risk to an acceptable level.”He added: “I also believe that very much in contrast to the general public in Europe, USA and Australia, people in Hong Kong are fairly diligently applying social distancing and other hygienic measures, and that will reduce opportunity for secondary spread significantly.”But Professor Pfeiffer questioned how long such measures would be possible as businesses suffered, creating “horrendous social and economic costs” that would haunt future generations. “We cannot all just literally ‘turn the lights off’ by fencing us all in, in the belief that we will be secure,” he said. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/15/08/coronavirus-london.jpg","title":"interest rates bank of england coronavirus today latest","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The central bank will also buy £200bn\u0026nbspmore UK assets, restarting its quantitative easing policyThe Bank of England cut interest rates to a new historic low of 0.1 per cent on Thursday amid the UK’s spiralling coronavirus economic crisis.The central bank will also buy £200bn more UK financial assets, restarting its quantitative easing policy, in an bid to calm British bond markets where were “bordering on disorderly”.The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously for the emergency action to support the British economy at a special meeting.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The rates move follows a 0.5 per cent cut\u0026nbspannounced on 12 March by the bank, to coincide with the Budget, which took rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent, the previous record low.The new asset purchases, which will be mainly made up of UK government debt but will also include investment-grade corporate bonds, will take the bank’s stock of assets to £625bn, around 30 per cent of GDP.Government debt – known as gilts – have fallen in price in recent days amid heavy selling by investors. The value of sterling also slumped by some 4 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level since the collapse of 1985.In a statement the bank attributed this to investors seeking the safety and liquidity of shorter term debt.“Over recent days, and in common with a number of other advanced economy bond markets, conditions in the UK gilt market have deteriorated as investors have sought shorter-dated instruments that are closer substitutes for highly liquid central bank reserves,” it said.In a conference call with journalists after the decision the bank’s new governor Andrew Bailey said that markets had been “bordering on disorderly”, persuading the bank to restart its asset purchases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rates have never been this low in the more than 300-year history of the Bank of England. Purchases of government and corporate bonds have been ramped up. A desperate measure for a desperate situation,” said Tom Stevenson of Fidelity International.Earlier this week the bank unveiled details of a scheme to buy debt from large distressed companies called the Covid-19 Corporate Financing Facility.Mr Bailey urged struggling companies to seek help from the bank and private lenders rather than shedding staff.Other central banks are also acting in the face of the global economic shock.America’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, has also cut rates to historic lows of 0.25 per cent. On Wednesday the European Central Bank announced a new €750bn government bond-buying operation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The estate agent said it had apologised “unreservedly” to the tenant and offered them compensation.“We are taking the Covid-19 outbreak extremely seriously and we have reiterated to our staff that whatever the situation, anyone’s self-isolation should not be interrupted,” Foxtons said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If they answer yes to any of these, then the agent shouldn’t conduct the viewing.Property inspections should be postponed unless they are absolutely necessary, Mr Cox said. If the work is vital, then they should ask tenants if they have had any symptoms or contact with someone who has symptoms. If not, then the work should go ahead but with added hygiene checks, thorough cleaning and use of disposable gloves.The trade body has issued guidance to lettings agents to help them deal with Covid-19.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Among other options are having a pre-loaded gas or electricity card sent you in the post, or having funds added to your meter credit directly by your supplier.Those in financial distress can request to have debt repayments and bill payments reassessed, paused or reduced if needed.

Nashville is notoriously unkind to female country artists, particularly young ones, so you can’t help but admire a then-16-year-old Swift, who offered a profound respect to one of her biggest inspirations on her debut single.This song is essentially one big, lustful sigh: Swift seems to delight in a secret romance where she “only bought this dress so you could take it off” and quite literally pants with anticipation.Getty Images for TAS1120 10) “Miss Americana \u0026amp the Heartbreak Prince”At first, you could mistake this for a love song. It is, in a way - Swift\u0027s most political song to date addresses her heartbreak over America as she witnesses it in turmoil. She takes classic themes from her earliest work - white knights, red roses, princesses and high-school prom - and spins all of it into a metaphor for a perceived loss of innocence following the 2016 general election. Add the subliminal cheerleader chant - GO! FIGHT! Win!, and this makes for one of Swift\u0027s best songs of her career.While Red signalled Swift’s full-blown transition into pop music, she couldn’t resist putting the odd country twang on songs such as “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, which mocks an ex for being snobbish about his “indie record label that’s much cooler than mine”. The most spectacular is really the beginning of the song, where she delivers an astounded “what?” upon being told the guy needs space: “We hadn’t seen each other in a month.”John Mayer lashed out over this song in 2012, clearly upset after Swift alluded that it was about their past relationship. He called it “cheap songwriting” in reference to using their personal lives for material – whatever you think of that, it’s features of her best vocal performances and brilliant songwriting – right down to the Mayer-ism of that wavering electric guitar line. Then there are the lyrics themselves: “You are an expert at sorry And keeping lines blurry And never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you’ve run dry Have tired, lifeless eyes ’Cause you burned them out.” Medic!One of Swift’s greatest talents as a songwriter is to encapsulate those small moments, often in a new relationship, that you as a listener cannot. Her skittishness on “Delicate”, about the danger of rushing into something, of sharing too much of yourself too soon with someone you’re still getting to know, is all too palpable as the beat switches up like a nervous heart.(Photo by Dimitrios KambourisGetty Images for TIME)The lyrics here are more open and willingly vulnerable than anything Swift had done before that line on the chorus where she sings: “My baby’s fly like a jet stream high above the whole scene loves me like I’m brand new” hits hard. The song appears on Reputation, released after Swift’s lengthy hiatus from the spotlight, and its lyrics speak of a person blissfully content in her relationship – to the point that the outside world is just white noise. It includes some of her finest lyrics, too, with superb references to those castles of old crumbling “overnight” and nods to her Anglophilia (“my baby’s fit like a daydream”).“Mean” is beaten only by “Our Song” as Swift’s most “country” release, helped a lot by her endearing portrait of “the slam of screen doors” and driving along country lanes listening to the radio. Swift is a master of the meta-narrative, so her making a song about a song based on sounds from real-life is all kinds of perfect.On “Getaway Car” Swift channels one of her friend and producer Jack Antonoff’s favourites – Kate Bush – as she belts that epic “go, go, go!”, while the song in its entirety recalls Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” – cellos and violins enhancing the drama.Getty Images for NARAS“Blank Space” was a real moment for Swift, where she turned all of the tabloid gossip, all of the malicious scrutiny around her love life, back on the world with a wink and a nod. “Got a long list of ex-lovers They’ll tell you I’m insane,” she trills on the chorus, throwing out punchline after punchline until the exquisite: “You’ll come back, each time you leave ‘cos darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.”Against a similar soundscape to Wildest Dreams, Swift is at her most confessional as she explains how her own insecurities can lead to self-destruction in a relationship – and pleads with her lover to be patient with her. “It’s all me, in my head, she sings. I’m the one who burned us down But it’s not what I meant Sorry that I hurt you.”Swift’s mastery of storytelling has never been better than on this, a standout song not just from Red, but of her career to date. It’s the slow-build from those bittersweet memories of “dancing in the refrigerator light” to a devastating, stadium-sized anthem that leads to her delivering arguably her best-ever line – with one of her best vocal performances: “You call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest.”This song is sadly marred by the controversy that surrounded its accompanying video (its references to films such as Out of Africa drew accusations that it presented a “white colonialist fantasy”.) The track itself is a dreamy, lush soundscape filled with breathless sighs and dramatic pauses that recall Swift’s fellow old Hollywood obsessive, Lana Del Rey.A pop-punk song!

It includes some of her finest lyrics, too, with superb references to those castles of old crumbling “overnight” and nods to her Anglophilia (“my baby’s fit like a daydream”).“Mean” is beaten only by “Our Song” as Swift’s most “country” release, helped a lot by her endearing portrait of “the slam of screen doors” and driving along country lanes listening to the radio. Swift is a master of the meta-narrative, so her making a song about a song based on sounds from real-life is all kinds of perfect.On “Getaway Car” Swift channels one of her friend and producer Jack Antonoff’s favourites – Kate Bush – as she belts that epic “go, go, go!”, while the song in its entirety recalls Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” – cellos and violins enhancing the drama.Getty Images for NARAS“Blank Space” was a real moment for Swift, where she turned all of the tabloid gossip, all of the malicious scrutiny around her love life, back on the world with a wink and a nod. “Got a long list of ex-lovers They’ll tell you I’m insane,” she trills on the chorus, throwing out punchline after punchline until the exquisite: “You’ll come back, each time you leave ‘cos darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.”Against a similar soundscape to Wildest Dreams, Swift is at her most confessional as she explains how her own insecurities can lead to self-destruction in a relationship – and pleads with her lover to be patient with her. “It’s all me, in my head, she sings. I’m the one who burned us down But it’s not what I meant Sorry that I hurt you.”Swift’s mastery of storytelling has never been better than on this, a standout song not just from Red, but of her career to date. It’s the slow-build from those bittersweet memories of “dancing in the refrigerator light” to a devastating, stadium-sized anthem that leads to her delivering arguably her best-ever line – with one of her best vocal performances: “You call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest.”Her comment appears to be in reference to\u0026nbspFearless\u0026nbspand West’s notorious stage-crash while Swift was being honoured for Video of the Year at the AMAs.\u0026nbspAt no time in the clips does West make any mention of the fact that he would call Swift a “bitch” in the song or claim he “made her famous”.At the time of writing, neither Swift nor West have publicly commented about the new video. #KanyeWestisOverParty was one of the top trends on Twitter, similar to the 2016 #TaylorSwiftisOverParty trend sparked after Kardashian shared the edited video.Swift’s album\u0026nbspLover\u0026nbspwas released in 2019 to positive reviews and became the best-selling record of that year.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It looks outwardly near-identical to the current model, but it offers better value, increased storage and faster performance. But even these things are not the game-changer: that’s the new keyboard.The pricing first: where the previous MacBook Air, on sale until just days ago, cost £1,099 and came with 128GB of internal storage, the entry-level Air is now £100 less, £999, and has 256GB of storage. There’s also a 512GB model available, with a faster processor, for £1,299. There are still lots of laptops out there for much less money, but this price represents good value. Note that Apple has education pricing for those in class as students or teachers, so it’s possible to get that price even lower if you qualify.The look is the same as before: sleek and classy. It comes in three colours, silver, space grey and gold. The space grey is the best: solid and businesslike without looking boring, though the gold, warm with a peachy hint to it, is also a head-turner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe build quality of the MacBook Air is exceptional, an all-aluminium casing that’s sculpted to the slimmest of edges to make it easy to pick up. Like all MacBooks, and unlike many other laptops, you can open it with one hand, the build is so perfectly balanced. Other machines require a finger to hold down the keyboard as you open the lid or the whole thing swings up as it opens.This MacBook Air continues to have a power button with Touch ID built in – a fingerprint scanner that ensures your computer screen locks when you’re away from it and only unlocks to your finger. Apple Watch wearers can also use their smart timepiece to unlock the MacBook Air, which is cool. Both mechanisms feel intimate and secure.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The Air has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. For other connections, such as USB-A, you’ll need an adaptor. That’s not always convenient, though it gets easier all the time as more accessories switch to USB-C, and it helps to keep the Air thin.The MacBook Air has been preposterously slim and light since it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2008 when the then-CEO slid it out of an envelope to an admiring crowd. It was so much thinner and lighter than the competition that it drew gasps of excitement. Over the next decade it slipped behind, especially in terms of the screen resolution, though that’s been fixed. Now, the 13in display is bright, rich and superbly high-resolution.Apple releases iPad with 3D scanner and a trackpadApple and Netflix pull out of SXSW over coronavirus fearsAnd then there’s the new keyboard. Apple keyboards were traditionally outstanding, using a scissor-switch mechanism, with lots of travel and a great feel. Then, a few years ago, Apple changed to a whole new system, using a butterfly mechanism. The first-generation of this was quite noisy, but this was overcome in subsequent versions. But then, problems arose which led to keyboards being replaced as users complained that there wasn’t the same reliability.Last year, on the MacBook Pro 16in, Apple introduced the Magic Keyboard – a name taken from its desktop wireless keyboard – which changed everything. The new keys were quieter, more stable and had more travel – a full 1mm. That’s not quite as much as the keys moved before the butterfly landed, when it was 1.2mm. But it was enough, and it was a revelation.It’s the same here. Using the new keyboard subtly transforms the typing experience. It’s not that the butterfly keys were bad: unless they failed, they worked well and were comfortable to use.But as soon as you use the new Magic Keyboard, you recognise how comfortable and inviting it is. The downside is it’s quite hard to go back. Having typed this review on the MacBook Air keys, I picked up a previous Air to make a comparison. As soon as I started typing, my fingers told me I was missing the new experience. The keys on the old Air, which I had used happily before, just couldn’t match the luxurious and satisfying feel of the new one. The gentle scoop on the top of each key that helps your fingers find the right place to touch, the crisper inidual backlighting to make typing in a less bright room a breeze and the clearer lettering on each key – all of which are small, subtle improvements that Apple has made with the Magic Keyboard – add up to something big.The processor has been improved on the latest models with a 1.1GHz dual-core Core i3 processor on the £999 model and a 1.1GHz quad-core Core i5 chip on the £1,299 version.In practical terms, this means that the Air is a real performer. Not that it was a slouch before, but it handles tasks easily. It’s true, the MacBook Pro is still the go-to laptop for those doing advanced video processing or running other power-hungry programs. But the Air is now very fast and effective. To the extent that many customers may ask whether they really need to spend £1,299 on the entry-level 13in MacBook Pro rather than a £999 MacBook Air that isn’t that far off. Sure, there are other extras in the Pro range, like the spiffy Touch Bar instead of function keys, and four Thunderbolt USB-C sockets instead of two on the Air, for instance.Battery life on the MacBook Air is exemplary: it just goes on and on all day where other laptops, including some MacBook Pro models, don’t last as long. It’s so good that you may not even think about checking how much charge is left in the battery. It gives a great feeling of peace of mind.The new MacBook Air is available for order now, with deliveries starting next week. It represents a big step forward for the super-slim Apple laptop, combining sumptuous good looks with real performance and, above all, an unbeatably appealing keyboard.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our Games are not next week or two weeks from now. They’re four months from now. I think a lot may change in that time period. So we are affording the IOC the opportunity to gather that information and expert advice, and at this point in time we do not feel it’s necessary for us to insist that they make a decision.”USA Swimming is a huge draw when watching the Olympic Games given the level their athletes perform at, with former\u0026nbspswimmers including Michael Phelps, who is the most decorated Olympian of all time. So the organisation speaking out against the continuation of the Games comes as\u0026nbspa huge blow for the IOC while it weighs the difficult decision.Jacob Pebley, a swimmer on the 2016 US Olympic‘s team, released a statement about why the Games should be postponed this year.\u0026nbspTeam USA and role models for hundreds of thousands of young athletes, attend Olympic Trialsthe Olympics in good conscience?” he wrote. “To do so would fly in the face of all emerging evidence and best practices for social distancing and protecting the health of vulnerable communities.”US Gymnastics team has not publicly taken a position on if the Olympics should be postponed this year.\u0026nbspThe British Olympic Association (BOA) recently said it would not “endanger the health” of its athletes by encouraging them to train for the Games if it was not in their best interest to do so.\u0026nbsp“We can be categorically clear that we will not endanger the health and wellbeing of the athletes or wider delegation at any point,” the BOA said.\u0026nbsp“It is imperative to preserve competitive integrity for athletes, but it is clearly only wise for athletes to continue to prepare for the Games where it is safe and appropriate to do so, within relevant Government and public health guidelines.”But the organisation said it\u0026nbspstill respected the IOC and its decision-making process when ultimately deciding if the Games should be postponed or continue.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And you’d also hope they take more care than they did with the actual production, which started to betray a “will-this-do ” attitude with almost its first caption of the night.“Dermot Munaghan.” And the next one: “Colston Smith.” .A foretaste of what was to come, because the event had technically unravelled within the first hour when Lineker had to introduce a comedy sketch about VAR and the  World Cup final.First it appeared, then it vanished. So Lineker explained the punchline: VAR had not just found in England’s favour it had decided to award the  World Cup to Scotlandand Euro  to Wales.Then the sketch suddenly reappeared again and took six minutes to reach its bloody, teeth-pulling conclusion: “I’m going to change my name to Jamie VAR-dy.”In such circumstances, you can sit and hope the rest of Sport Relief moves, inspires and thrills with a perfect blend of laughter, compassion and entertainment.And I can also hope Scotland are going to win the next World Cup. It ain’t going to happen.Sport Relief is never ever over quickly, ’cos there are a whole load of BBC formats to be put through the ringer, like Line Of Duty, and far too much dancing, featuring everyone from Lineker and McGuinnes to a “social media influencer”, called “HRVY”, which wasn’t another spelling mistake. I think he’s just an RSHOL.At ious other points in this back-of-a-fag-packet evening: Hockey player Sam Quek took , football penalties against a short fat bloke, from point-blank range, and contrived to miss more than a quarter of them. Mel Giedroyc farted on a Question Of Sport special. Rylan accused Romesh Ranganathan of being over-exposed, before playing Andy Murray at crazy golf. And they flagged up an Action Line number, for people who were feeling “emotionally vulnerable”, after the Killing Steves parody, which may have been the most benevolent gesture in the event’s history.What really irks about Sport Relief, though, is that, evencompassion fatigue has never been more of a problem, they’ve decided it’s a triumph before it’s broadcast and the “Best Bits” Sunday show is all ready to go.Corporate backing also means there’s little risk of them not beating the previous total either, which, I hope, doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing the sincere efforts of the public.If there’s one thing I’ll remember about Sport Relief , however, it’s the contribution of David Beckham, who, infor a y advertorial for his new MLS franchise and some crashing product placement , offered two entire people the chance to attend an Inter Miami game and win a shirt signed by such global talents as Lewis Morgan and A J DeLaGarza, who’s played  entire games for Guam.There are moments when the generosity and humanity of celebrities simply overwhelms me.This wasn’t one of those moments.Bloke.CHANNEL  seemed to have all bases covered for its hugely entertaining new dating show Five Guys A Week, at least in terms of complete bellends.So, crammed into a semi-detached house in St Albans, hoping to win the heart of its owner Amy, it had: Christian, whose job “isn’t as glamorous as it sounds” . Uber-woke Glen, from accounts. A stuntman called Michael, who seemed to have mistaken the show for SAS: Who Dares Wins and voluntarily withdrew on day two. Mad, goggle-eyed surfer Trystan, who appeared to be casing the joint for a “kill room”. And the lowest form of le known to any single thirtysomething man – the bloke with the acoustic guitar, Scott, who used to be a bank manager, but now earns a living as a country and western singer and will be performing under the stage name Johnny Cashpoint,he’s got an ounce of sense.The five were chosen for their ability to get right on the viewers’ nerves rather than real boyfriend potential, obviously.And it made for a cracking hour of TV, because they all competitively fancied the pants off Amy, who looked like a younger and much hotter Camilla Parker Bowles,you can imagine such a thing.The show’s greatest strength, of course, is also its biggest format failing, as I’d imagine no one wanted any of them to win.In the event, however, it came down to a straight fight between the lesser of two evils and, probably wisely, Amy chose cocky Christian, who’s looking to whisk her off for breakfast in France, ahead of grovelling Glen, who, rather than looking for “the Michelle Obama to my Barack”, should probably be aiming for the Michelle Collins to his Ian Beale.Five Guys A Week, C, tonight, .pm.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What caused the cancellation of six Wimbledon championships in the s ”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in north-east England shares its common name with the body of a ship ”Spin To Win, Phillip Schofield: “What Saturday night TV show is Anton du Beke most famous for ”Hunted, Dan: “Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ”LISA NANDY wasn’t born stupid. She volunteered to be, by standing for Labour Party leader.It means noisily backing every woke cause of the day, until their interests collide, as they did spectacularly on last Tuesday’s Good Morning Britain, where Piers Morgan hit her with two innocuous-sounding questions.“Are babies born either male or female ” and “Would you be happyUsain Bolt and Floyd Mayweather self-identied as women, spent a year having testosterone treatment and competed against women ”Correct answers: Yes and no.But Lisa couldn’t say that for fear of offending either the transgender or feminist lobbies.So instead she blathered, lied, evaded, shouted, demanded an apology from Piers , accused him of laughing and describing transgender people as “grotesque”and at one point muttered: “I don’t know what . . . I don’t know what, well, you know, I don’t know what.”Others would’ve let her off the hook at that point, as she was almost crying at her own stupidity by then.

They are resilient. You aren’t going to like it, but you’ll get through it.“You can compare it to the Blitz. People got through the Blitz. It was very stressful but they did it.”My elderly mother lives just a few roads away from me and, like so many with similarly vulnerable relatives, I’m making sure she’s OK.“Just pop a tin of Spam through the letterbox, and I’ll be fine,” she joked in reference to her time growing up during World War Two.But yesterday, three of her immediate neighbours — one of whom she’s never met — put notes through her door to say she should give them a callshe needed anything.In times of such crisis, our first thought is naturally of ourselves and our immediate loved ones.But it seems the upsideof the world slowing down and re-grouping might be that, no longer distracted by the busyness of our normal working days, we will “look up” and “reach out”, as they say in business circles, to those in our communities who might need help.There are plenty of people who already do sterling work in their area, but the onslaught of the coronavirus will perhaps lead to everyone now doing their bit.Quite right too. But the onus can’t solely rest on the shoulders of iniduals, so it’s only right the Government has stepped up to offer some practical help to businesses that will suffer throughout the coming weeks and months.Boris Johnson’s advice that people shouldn’t go to pubs cafes theatres etc is understandable in health terms, but will leave businesses facing a critical downturn in custom through no fault of their own.Yesterday, London restaurateur James Chiaini urged him to “crack open the war chest” and allow local businesses to stay afloat while simultaneously channelling efforts towards helping out in their immediate communities, and it seems that new Chancellor Rishi Sunak has listened.In James’s case, he has staff on hand and lots of food supplies, so instead of shutting down because there are no customers, he and other restaurants across the country could potentially now operate a batch-cooking and delivery service for those in need.Equally, the skill sets of many other businesses can be channelled into providing much-needed, state-funded help where it’s required.And the Government shouldn’t stop there. It should repurpose certain facilities too.Last week, it was reported that the £million Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Loughborough, Leics, is currently seriously underused because only current personnel can access it and only  have done so in the past  months.Madness. At the very least, it should be thrown open to all injured veterans who currently have to go through the overstretched NHS.Or how about temporarily repurposing it as a treatment centre for anyone who could benefit from its facilities, thereby alleviating some of the pressure on local hospitals The Government is clearly in uncharted territory right now because it is dealing with an unprecedented situation.But a continuation of joined-up thinking on how best to get us through this critical phase in our history will ensure that Britain’s enviable “Blitz spirit” is encouraged and kept strong for as long as it needs to be.PRINCE Harry is now back behind the closed doors of his rented Canadian mansion, licking his wounds after his public humiliation at the hands of phone pranksters.During a chat with what he thought was climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Harry pledged his support to the non-existent island of “Chunga-Changa” and failed to question why the hoaxers wanted to ship penguins to the North Pole when they’re actually native to the South Pole.Poor Harry.Still, it perhaps explains why, despite attending Eton, he got D at geography A level.Indeed, on all our faces in these challenging times.Heartfelt congratulations to her and husband Chris.FORMER All Saints star Nicole Appleton has given birth to her second child, a girl called Skipper, at the age of .“After hiding my pregnancy for the last nine months – which was so dficult and keeping her a secret from all my friends – I can finally announce our incredible news!” she wrote on Instagram.Fascinating.

This is a time for unity and for respecting others, especially the most vulnerable.As the Queen put it yesterday in her admirable statement: “I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”As the emergency deepens, abuse of privilege should play no part in our national response.But that is exactly what is now happening, as is graphically demonstrated by the saga of private Covid- tests kits.One of the biggest problems the Government faces is the shortage of capacity for testing.To prevent the current system from being overwhelmed by demand, NHS policy is only to test people with a “high chance” of having the illness, such as those who have ed from high-risk countries or are displaying symptoms.Even doctors and nurses working in the front-line are not routinely tested.But to evade such official restrictions, a growing number of the rich and famous are forking out for private coronavirus kits, which can cost anything between £ and £.According to one report this week, more than , wealthy figures in Britain have ordered such kits.Dr Mark Ali, director of the Harley Street clinic, said: “We have private iniduals – some recognisable names there – and we are testing lords and ladies and even doctors and dentists who are worried about catching the disease.”It is the same story of privileged access in the US, where, just as in Britain, shortages of supplies mean that many health care workers and sick people are unable to get diagnoses.But some stars seek to bypass rules that limit tests to those most at risk.A huge controversy erupted this week at the news that eight top NBA basketball teams has been tested, making a mockery of the rationing.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, spoke for much of the public when he said that “an entire NBA team should not get tested for Covid- while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealth, but for the sick.”On both sides of the Atlantic, this two-tiered approach is wrong on so many levels.It is a deep insult to healthcare workers. It is profoundly isive.And it does not lessen the burdens on the NHS here in Britain, as some apologists pretend.Those who test positive will still have to be treated in the health service, since the British private medical sector does not have the resources for this crisis.Selfish and irresponsible, the Covid-test queue jumpers are the equivalents of the supermarket stockpilers or the social distancing refuseniks who still insist on going down to the pub.During the Second World War, when the Blitz spirit was at its peak, there was fierce hostility to rich iniduals who tried to cheat on rationing regulations or avoid national service.The same contempt should now be shown to those who try to dodge the rules that promote fairness.But it is not just in testing where the narrow self-centredness of the rich can be found. They use their wealth to insulate themselves in other ways.Some are buying special private medical care, like intravenous infusions of vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.Lansherhof, a private medical facility at the London Arts Club, reported this week an  per cent increase in enquires for its Immune Plus Support Infusion, which costs £.The rich are also using private jet travel to avoid the rest of the public as they conduct business or fly to remote havens.Inquiries for international flights by private jets are estimated to be up nine-fold since the outbreak began, while Hong Kong International Airport reported this week its busiest day for private jet activity.Nor do the rich have to endure the normal airport ordeal suffered by other passengers.A spokeswoman for Quintessentially, a concierge company for millionaires, said: “Members who are travelling commercially are choosing to book elite services at airports, not your typical first-class lounge.For example, private terminals where guests are greeted and given their own suite.Check-in, customs and security are all done privately and guests are taken to the doors of the aircraft.Members can request for the jetty to be cleared so they minimise the interactions with other passengers”.Most Brits have no choice over where they live in the midst of this crisis.But that is not true of the wealthy who can find sanctuary in one of their many properties or rent out an expensive rural bolt-hole.Some are now paying £,-a-month for a luxury base in the Cotswolds.Nor does self-isolation have to be the imprisoning experience that it is for ordinary citizens.The rich can bring in private chefs for their dinners, or expensive tutors for their children.The company Tutors International, which provides elite tuition services, says it has seen “a massive upswing in requests” since the outbreak began.The elite even have luxury face masks. The fashionable Airinum Urban Air Mask costs £ and claims to protect “against airborne particles as small as .mm.”But in this rarefied world, problems are faced by the elite that would never be considered by others.Wailing that she now has now chance to show off her expensive jewellery, one female financier in London says: “I’m just not sure when my next ball will be.”The experience of the affluent is in dramatic contrast to the misery faced by people at the other end of the scale.While the rich cocoon themselves, it is the wage-earners, the straitened households, the poor and the unemployed who are now in the eye of the storm.Our society is just beginning to realize the terrying consequences of this disaster, where the mounting death toll is matched by economic meltdown.Vast numbers of people – from hotel cleaners to airline cabin crew, from bar staff to retail assistants – are going to lose their jobs.The ranks of the five million self-employed will be decimated. Small businesses across the country will collapse.Food banks are already running short of supplies, while the plight of the homeless – who cannot isolate themselves on the streets – is desperate as shelters close.At worst, our prosperous civilisation could slide into a kind of modern feudal structure, with only the aristocracy at the top enjoying a decent standard of living.At a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump was asked whether “the well-connected go to the front of the line”.He replied philosophically: “You’d have to ask them that. Perhaps that’s been the story of le.”But it should not be that way, especially when mankind is facing one of its darkest hours.We should all be in this together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That applies to children just as it does to the rest of us.”She said it was fine for siblings or children in “household groups” to play together.Dr Harris added that team sports should be avoided by both children and adults.The stark warning was issued in a document from a Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group, dated this Monday.But just three days later, the PM said the UK could “turn the tide” on the outbreak within  weeks.The experts say restrictions could be imposed or lted to control the spread of the virus and may y in dferent UK countries and regions at dferent times.However, they warn there is a risk of a second wave of infections later in the yearthe Government enforces too many restrictions at once and then lts them later.They also say school closures alone will have little impact on the epidemic and hit poorest families hardest.It could delay the peak by up to three weeks and reduce cases and deaths by five per cent.However, they also argue classroom shutdowns would be “most effectivestarted as early as possible” — a revelation likely to anger critics questioning why they were not shut sooner like in other European nations.Isolating sick households is predicted to reduce the peak of the outbreak by a quarter and deaths and cases by ten per cent.But getting people to work from home and avoid pubs, restaurants and cinemas has the greatest potential impact — reducing the peak by up to  per cent and deaths by  per cent.Researchers found Brits were most likely to catch coronavirus in family gatherings. The elderly were also at “high risk” at religious services and other get-togethers.Exeter University modelling suggests a major outbreak would last around four monthsno action was taken.Andsummer helps halt cases, it could lead to an even bigger — and deadlier — spike next winter.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page. That explains why ministers were keen not to halt all spread once the outbreak took hold.A previous study by Imperial College London showed failing to introduce severe social restrictions could have led to , deaths.Sir Patrick said: “This is an incredibly fast-moving, developing situation and as part of our collective efforts to give the clearest and most reliable scientic advice, SAGE has and continues to draw upon a huge range of experts and a huge range of evidence.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MUM-OF-ONE Bessie Antclfe, , runs Bessie’s Cafe and Bistro in Sheffield.She is taking meals to her customers in isolation and needs help with deliveries.Bessie says: “Anyone on lockdown can call us and we will leave meals at the door.“If you want to get out of the house and are not showing symptoms, then helping out would be cool.”.

Show some kindness.”“The small business who does everything they can not to lay off their staff.“The student who does a shop for their elderly neighbour.“The retired nurse who volunteers to cover some shts in the local hospital.“When this is over, and it will be over, we want to look back on this moment and remember the many small acts of kindness.“We want to look back on this time and remember how we thought first of others, and acted with decency.“We want to look back on this time and remember how, in the face of a generation- defining moment, we undertook a collective national effort and we stood together. It’s on all of us.”More than a million over-s and vulnerable people are facing lock-in for  weeks within days.There have already been many inspiring stories of kindness.Schoolboy Jimmy-Dean Hudson, seven, is the perfect Helping Hand Hero.He spent his pocket money buying dozens of toilet rolls — then GAVE them away to elderly neighbours in Southend, Essex.Milkman Tony Fowler has been delivering loo roll and hand sanitiser and collecting prescriptions for elderly customers on his round in Melton Mowbray, Leics.Many elderly people are trapped behind closed doors, terried.Age UK’s advice line has seen a  per cent increase in demand, while The Silver Line has experienced a  per cent rise in calls from anxious older people in need of reassurance and friendship.Elderly people have already been swindled out of more than £, by coronavirus scammers, says the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau.Many older people are right to be wary of offers to run errands.So, please, only ask to help old folk you know and who trust you.THERE are lots of brilliant organisations, big and small, desperate for people to help out by donating their time.By being Helping Hand Heroes we can make Britain feel a better place.Try one or more of these ways to help an elderly neighbour:CARE PACKAGES: Drop a surprise one to a neighbour.Give them a call to say you have left it.FLYERS: Make some with your number on and give to neighbours so they can callthey need help.WHATSAPP: Join or start a community WhatsApp group to help vulnerable neighbours.GET CREATIVE: Design cheerful cards with your kids to send to care homes to boost morale.BUDDY UP: Create a buddy system to check in daily with an older person by phone to beat loneliness.FLOWERS: Place a bouquet on the doorstep of someone in self- isolation to brighten up their day.Don’t go in, just knock.OLD PHONES: Offer old mobiles to neighbours and buy them a cheap SIM so they can stay in touch.Clean properly first.NEWSPAPER: Let housebound people know about The Sun’s -week free delivery offer so they can keep up with the news in Britain’s favourite paper.TAKEAWAY: Order food for someone who is vulnerable or self-isolating so they do not have to cook.MEMOIRS: Ask older family members to write down their le story and read it to you over the phone to keep them occupied.But it is not just the elderly who need your help.With most schools closed, possibly until after the summer holidays, give a hand to a struggling mum or dad, too.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.BABYSIT: Leave a note under the door of a neighbour you know well, offering to look after the kids.FOOD BANK: Managed to find supplies at the supermarket Put some in the food bank basket as they are short of stock.SHOPPING: Help out a nurse or a health worker by popping to the shops for them.WALKIES: Offer to take a neighbour’s dog out, or pet sitthey are a key worker.DONATE: If you are working from home, consider donating the money you would have spent commuting to a charity that helps the needy.KEEP QUIET: It is tempting to do loads of DIY when you are stuck in the house — but turn down the volume.Let neighbours get a good night’s sleep.BINGE WATCH: Add more users to your Netflix and Amazon Prime accounts so friends can watch too.VIRTUAL PINT: At the end of a day working from home, hit the phone and check on your workmates or share a “virtual pint” on FaceTime.SMALL BUSINESSES: Support firms that are still trading in your community by buying gt cards.And we can all follow the advice of milkman Tony.He says: “In  years as a milkman I have never let anyone down and I don’t intend to now.“I know how a small act of kindness can make a huge dference to people who need a bit of help.”HISTORY tells us that battles are won by people – people with the determination to see things through to the end.Beating coronavirus is one of those battles that requires determination to the end.However, there is one weapon we need to see in greater use.It is the power of kindness.Set against the chaos of people fighting and jostling in supermarkets to claim the last pack of loo rolls is the example of the unknown shopper who overheard a gentleman asking for a pack of mince.There was none left on the shelves so she followed him out of the shop, insisting he took one of hers, at no cost.That is the sort of kindness we need to see right across the country.When all this has died down, will you be remembered as a hoarder or a helper Many people up and down our country need help right now: Those who are lonely because they are self-isolating, those who are ill, those who are frightened and those who are running out of money to pay bills or buy food.This is where charities and community groups can make a real dference – on the ground, on the front line, where people are in real need.But just at the time they are needed most, many charities themselves are struggling to survive.Their traditional means of fundraising have dried up.Social distancing means jumble sales and quiz nights are cancelled, the London Marathon, which raises so much for charities, is postponed and, just like businesses, charities are wonderingthey can survive.Perhaps the Government will realise the extent of this crisis in the voluntary sector and put in some money.Just a fraction of what is going to businesses would be transformational. So far this is not forthcoming.But this is where we can all get involved, show our kindness, help others and help ourselves.The National Emergencies Trust , set up after the Manchester Arena bombing and the Grenfell Tower fire, launched an appeal on Wednesday, brilliantly promoted by The Duke of Cambridge.Already more than £million has been donated by the public and generous corporations – and the figure is steadily rising.We are “all in this together” but now there is the opportunity for us all to get stuck in and help each other through this crisis.The power of your kindness will help us all get through these dficult days and back to the kind of le that we all want to lead again.To donate to the National Emergencies Trust click here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The dramatic partial lockdown of Britain came as the coronavirus death toll continues to rise with  more deaths today taking the total to . The Prime Minister told a press conference today that people should stay at home as he warned of the fatal consequences for the communitypeople flouted the new restrictions. So what does the lockdown mean in practice and where can and canapost you go  What is closing and where      The PM ordered all social venues to close their doors today. It means that the following are all expected to close their doors as soon as possible today and not reopen:Food and drink venues Pubs, bars and clubs Cinemas, theatres, concert and bingo halls Spas, indoor leisure and gyms Casinos and betting shops Museums and galleriesThe closures will happen across the UK with the government taking the step with the agreement of the four nations of the UK.  For how long  To start with they will be closed for  days, that is two weeks, but the government has said it will keep the policy under review. Realistically the government believe that the peak of this virus is about three months away and so it is hard to see it ending after the two weeks that they have set out. How will it be enforced     A ban on pubs and restaurants staying open during the coronavirus outbreak will be enforced strictlynecessary through licensing rules, When asked by reporters how the ban would be enforced, he said clearly there are licensing arrangements which will make it relatively simple to do should that really be necessary. He said the ban would be enforced strictly but stopped short of elaborating on measures that could be taken other than possibly indicating that revoking licences may be an option. The licensing system is run through councils and could be a very messy way of enforcing anyone who disobeys. However, emergency laws being rushed through Parliament next week will give the government far stricter and more direct powers to order venues to closethey disobey. Will supermarkets, pharmacies and shops still be open     Yes. Supermarkets will remain open and shops will do too. But the government is advising people to be cautious in these settings, to try and go at a quieter time and to wash their hands. Can I still get a takeaway  Yes, the PM was very clear on this they want restaurants to continue doing takeaway food. In fact, Mr Johnson said he specically wanted restaurants to do this. Earlier this week the government announced it was suspending regulations which mean restaurants have to apply to become takeaways in order to ensure food delivery continued. Why are they doing it now     As coronavirus ramps up around the country - with cases increasing every day - the government said these steps are necessary. Tthe Prime Minister said the measures were needed to reduce unnecessary social gatherings by % in order to have an impact on the infection rate. The speed of our eventual recovery depends entirely on our collective ability to get on top of the virus now and that means we have to take the next steps on scientic advice, he said. And following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday. We need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us. The announcement came after scientists advising the Government warned that restrictions to control the spread of the virus will need to be in place for most of a year - at least. But I have plans to go out this weekend or host a party... Do. Not. Go. Out. Do. Not. Have. People. Over. The government doesnapost plan to personally stop you hosting a party - but it is telling you how irresponsible this is. Healthy people can still carry it and spread it to others. Mr Johnson said: aposYou may be tempted to go out tonight and I say to you please donapost, you may think that you are invincible - but there is no guarantee that you will get it. But you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on. Mr Johnson said those who flouted the rules could end up causing fatal consequences Can I visit my mum on Motheraposs Day     Boris Johnson said you should think very carefully before paying a Motheraposs Day visit during the coronavirus pandemic. Advice to the public includes avoiding all non-essential contact, a measure which is particularly important for the over-s and others who are most vulnerable to succumb to the infection. Mr Johnson was asked at his Covid- press conference on Friday what his advice was to people thinking about visiting their mother on Sunday. I think my advice would be that people should really think very carefully, irrespectively of whether theyaposre visiting their mother, any elderly person who will be in a vulnerable group, he said. Mr Johnson said he would see his mum, but on Skype. aposBut what about my freedomapos you might say Mr Johnson tried to deal with this point directly. He said: I do accept that what weaposre doing is extraordinary - weaposre taking away the ancient inalienable right of freeborn people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub. And I can understand how people feel about that. But I say to people who do go against the advice that weaposre getting, the very clear advice that weaposre getting from our medical and scientic experts, you know youaposre not only putting your own le, the lives of your family, at risk - youaposre endangering the community. And youaposre making it more dficult for us to get on and protect the NHS and save lives.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe biggest, absolutely worst news I have this week is that our wedding has been postponed. It’s due in July and with so many family members coming from around the world, it’s unlikely that it will be able to go ahead. It’s been such a massive decision but last night, I had a voicemail from my sister who lives in Melbourne and who has battled breast cancer alongside me since my recurrence. . She was absolutely devastated on the phone and it broke my heart into a trillion pieces. She has always been pretty pragmatic and solid as as rock and she has always bloody mothered me. so to hear her sobs was just awful. Our wedding for her is massive and we just can’t do it without her. Our beautul venue, Hobbit Hill, is looking at rescheduling all weddings and so we asked about the possibility of changing our date until July  but all summer dates are booked up. Nooooooooo! We’d really wanted to get married in the summer as the venue has so many gorgeous outdoorsy treats. We were going to be married in the outdoor woodland. Buuuut what can we do  We have changed it to th April and all we can do is hope for some lovely April spring. The devil on my shoulder was there straight away telling me I won’t even be alive to see . Ugh, cancer I hate youI don’t know about anyone , but this has really triggered my cancer anxiety again. Homeschooling Ivy and having her so close to me all the time - it makes me frightened that something bad will happen and she’ll have to be without me. She just couldn’t cope. So many emotions at the moment, stress, worry, fear, anxiety, hope, anger, love. Allll the feels. But anyway, wow - absolute meltdown across the globe. We’re witnessing something we’ve never seen in our letime - toilet roll hoarders, greedy capitalist pigs. It’s bringing out the worst in a lot of us. My brother is stuck in Spain - Ryanair have offered to fly him home for an additional £. My friends ran out of her £. baby formula, but it’s okay because someone is selling them on Ebay for £.!!! These guys in Aldi were allowed to fill their trollies with wipes and nappies last week which they then loaded into their van. You guessed it - Aldi nappies and wipes now on sale on Ebay for a disgusting amount. How the hell is this not illegal  It’s children’s necessities FFS. Ebay have been contacted with no reply, Aldi too. They’re just reaping all the profits from our despair. Do you think the staff will be seeing anything extra in their pay-packet  It is not right. And I’m very happy to say that in contrast - there is so much bloody loveliness coming out of the world too. Facebook groups being set up to help neighbours or vulnerable. I’m social distancing because of chemo and this week, so many people have askedwe need help. I’ve had nappies and hand gel and school books for Ivy delivered - even some flower-seeds to spread in the garden with Ivy. I’ve seen people doing shopping for others and free teaching support being offered and meals being left on doorsteps. I absolutely adore this side of the human race.  I’ve been home-schooling Ivy and although I set out to keep it as ‘schooly’ as I could, I’ve found so many fun activities to do that we both actually enjoy Pizza fractions, writing and then learning all the words to her favourite songs, writing stories and drawing together. We’ve learnt to measure out ingredients on the scales, we’ve learnt about Ireland for St Patrickaposs day and we’ve learnt about bees.There’s so much to learn from once you get going! I’ve been looking here for fun learning games and activities www.brightminds and there’s soooo much!  We’ve also bagged ourselves one of these whoopass Roccbox pizza ovens. OMG I cannot wait to give this a go. They’re portable so you can take them to the beach or the park or wherever you find yourself isolating. And the pizzas only take  seconds to cook - maybe it isn’t the end of the world we’re postponing the wedding because my the forecast for my waistline just got a whole lot bigger!

All passengers apart from French nationals were stopped from leaving the ship when it docked in Marseille, France, on Friday morning. The decision reportedly nearly sparked a riot on board, with the coupleaposs fellow passenger Ted Hills, from Lockerbie, revealing fights had broken out between a few people. Virginia said: “We are now really frightened and have real concerns for our safety. Bill along with others only has another week or so of medication left.“Bill has actually just turned  and in Italy, they’re refusing to treat anyone over the age of . They won’t give them any  medical treatment.“I would say about % of the people on this boat are above that age. The Italian health service is just not going to have the capacity to deal with itany of us get sick.” Virginia added that they had received daily confirmation that there is currently no sign of coronavirus on the Costa Pacica. But they’re concerned about the lack of information about what will happen when they arrive in Italy, which now has the highest number of deaths relating to Covid-.  She added: “What we can’t understand is, they’re getting other people back from places like Cuba. I know that they’re so busy at the moment. “If they weren’t taking us to Italy and we were staying here in Marseille, I could understand it but they’re taking us to Italy which is the eye of the storm. “If we had information we could deal with it whether it was good, bad or ugly but they’re not giving us any information. “My husband and I tried to speak to the captain this morning and asked what would happen when we got to Italy and he just threw his hands up in the air and walked away from us. “We asked whatwe get to Italy and we can’t get off the boat because it’s dangerous, and he said well you can just stay on the boat for two months and turned around and walked away.  “We’re trying to get someone in the UK government to intervene and to stop the boat from leaving here. They just can’t send us to Italy.” The couple boarded the boat in Buenos Aires on March  before setting sail to Brazil. It was then due to travel to Tenere but was redirected to Barcelona with passengers told they could disembark. Spanish authorities then implemented a country-wide shutdown and the boat headed to Marseille, where again, travellers were told they would be able to leave. Virginia said: “The boat really shouldn’t have come to Europe, but they kept charging on with it and we were at sea for  days.  “They told us we would be getting off in Barcelona but that closed. They then told us we would be getting off yesterday here in Marseille. “They asked for all our onward flight details, they even explained they would put an ‘air bridge’ in place to get us off the boat and onto sanitised shuttle buses to the airport and put us onto planes that they wouldn’t fill so we wouldn’t get infected by coronavirus. “They told me they had chartered flights to Heathrow and Gatwick so everyone was ready to get off. “When we came to Marseille yesterday, there was actually a sense of jubilation at seeing and after  days. But at pm, the captain said it was only French nationals that would be getting off.

This is despite officials stressing there is no need to panic buy or stockpile - and that it means those most in need cannot get their essentials. The queue stretched the entireof the Tesco car park in New Malden, south-west London this morning. Drone footage taken at am shows shoppers patiently waiting in line for the superstore to open. The queue is so long some shoppers are waiting near to the entrance and exit of the car park on the roadside. And in another Tesco Extra in Hampton, Peterborough, shelves had already cleared by am this morning. It comes after Tesco announced a three per person limit on all items as part of latest efforts to curb panic-buying. The restrictions were imposed on Thursday but at this stage has done little to cope with the high demand. Many shoppers visiting supermarkets in the afternoon or evening have been greeted with empty shelves, with most meat, including chicken, turkey and beef sold out. Items such as frozen vegetables, crisps, squash, fresh milk, pasta and rice are also proving hard to get hold of, as are most tinned foods, such as pasta sauces.  Overnight three people were arrested in the Essex area for a suspected theft of toilet roll. Police were called to the Tesco superstore in New Malden on Friday after tensions among shoppers increased, with many ransacking shelves and paying little attention to pensioners. In a letter to staff, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis wrote that all counter services will be closed to focus on stocking shelves from Thursday.  Lewis said the chain will encourage healthy shoppers to come to stores and free up online capacity, and make am to am an hour prioritised to vulnerable and elderly customers. He added: It is fair to say that we find ourselves in uncharted waters. Covid- is bringing a change to the UK and itaposs clear that lots of things are going to have to sht around in order to help us cope.  A Tesco spokesperson added: ​We are changing these store hours to ensure we can serve customers better at this time.  It gives our colleagues the time overnight to restock the store, replenish the shelves and support our online grocery service at a time when demand is high. In a bid to cope with demand, Tesco is advertising thousands of jobs as the stockpiling shows little sign of slowing down.

Rough sleepers are signicantly more likely to have underlying health conditions - including respiratory problems - than the wider population, while they are also far less likely to be able to follow Public Health England advice on self-isolation, social distancing and hand-washing. Mr Khan said: The coronavirus outbreak affects everyone in London and we must do all we can to safeguard everyoneaposs health - not least those Londoners who face spending each night sleeping rough on the capitalaposs streets. Rough sleepers already face dficult and uncertain lives and Iaposm determined to do all I can to ensure they, along with all Londoners, are given the best protection possible. Together, as a city, we will come through this incredibly challenging period.  It has been said the hotel rooms will provide vital protection for rough sleepers who can use the space to self-isolate. The mayoraposs office added it will continue to support a range of partners including Londonaposs boroughs and the Ministry of Housing to identy and help other rough sleepers.

Ingé Kirsten, from Newcastle, posted harrowing video showing her coughing while hooked up to a ventilator with a mask over her face in hospital. In another clip, the -year-old, who has a heart condition, repeatedly coughs and struggles to breathe as she begs people to self-isolate and follow social distancing guidelines. She hit out at those who are ignoring the governmentaposs Covid- advice, telling : I think it’s really bad. I don’t think people have realised how serious it is. Iaposm sure no one would want themselves or their loved ones in this position or worse. Have you been affected by the coronavirus outbreak  Email webnews@mirror. Why aren’t pubs or bars realising the impact that they are having by staying open  Why would people put their lives and others at risk  It’s bizarre to me. I think people think they’re immune to it. No one is. It’s doesn’t discriminate who it takes hold of. “And I understand people are scared and panicking buying but not sparing a thought for other is awful. I’m glad I can’t leave my house to witness it first hand. People have been leaving care packages at my door for me.I’ve seen so many lovely posts of people helping others, older people, with care packages. I shared my story as I was sick of people not taking it seriously and still putting themselves or others at risk. Hopefully they’ll be a bit more mindful now. Ingé, who works in a call centre, said doctors told her that she is likely suffering from coronavirus. She was sent home without being tested and told to stay away from others. Her -year-old daughter, Macey, and her cousin have been ordered to self-isolate away from her due to potential exposure to Covid- Ingé said: It started last Thursday, I think. The day after my birthday. I didn’t do anything on my birthday as I’ve just moved into my new house. But I slept for almost  hours and just generally felt really unwell.Then sat I started to get a sore throat and losing my voice. By Sunday afternoon I could barely breathe for coughing. I had to call  again last night and they sent an ambulance pretty quick as I couldn’t breathe for coughing. They ran some tests for blood pressure, temperature, etc but as it wasn’t bad enough to be admitted they’ve told me to carry on as I am isolating at home with the steroids and paracetamol.  Ingé desperately misses her daughter and has been trying to cope with loneliness while self-isolating. She said: It is really hard being away from Macey. She came to hospital with me and my cousin and the doctor told her to take my daughter home to her house as she cannot be around me for  days. So she’s currently at my cousinaposs home. We’ve been FaceTiming but she’s only  and missing being with me a lot.  In one of her videos, Ingé coughs repeatedly and struggles to breathe. She wheezes with every breath and holds her hand to her chest as she coughs in pain. She tells the camera: I just wanted to make a video of how bad it actually is because I know a lot of people out there donapost really believe that itaposs a serious virus or anything like that. This is me breathing. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Itaposs absolutely horrendous so any advice to those who donapost believe it or arenapost taking any safety precautions, seriously do. None of this is worth your health. In a post, she wrote: I realise that this is all a very worrying time and some people are not that concerned. I didn’t want to share my experience so publicly however people should know that this virus disease is no laughing matter. It began last week without me even realising I may have been infected. Thursday I slept for almost  hours, Saturday I started with a sore throat and began to lose my voice. For those concerned they have coronavirus in the UK, Public Health England has issued advice about how to self-isolate. . Stay at home: Donapost leave your house except when you need to seek medical care. Ask for help buying groceries or have them delivered.. Stat away from your housemates: Stick in a well-ventilated room away from others, with the door closed. Use a separate bathroom and wear a facemask when it shared areas..

Tesco and Marks  Spencer unveiled dedicated slots after a heartbreaking video by critical care nurse Dawn Bilbrough begged hoarders to be considerate. And her plea has been backed by the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Physicians and union Unison, which are telling supermarkets and the Government: “More must be done.” Dawn, , who works in an intensive care unit in Leeds, West Yorks, was tearful as she told of finding aisles of empty racking as she tried to buy a few items after a two-day sht. While she was saving lives, coronavirus fears fuelled scenes of chaos across the land with people queueing outside supermarkets and cash and carries from the early hours to stockpile. In an emotional appeal that shamed the culprits, Dawn said: “I’ve just come out of the supermarket – there’s no fruit and veg. “I had a little cry in there. I’m a critical care nurse and I’ve just finished  hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next  hours. I just don’t know how I’m supposed to stay healthy. “Those people who are just stripping the shelves of basic foods – you need to stop it because it’s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest. Just stop it. Please.” Tesco has now said the hour before official opening every Sunday will be a shopping slot exclusively for NHS staff, with ID checks to keep out hoarders.  The firm said: “We know those working for the NHS may be finding it hard to find time to shop at the moment. “So from this Sunday we’re going to introduce a special hour for NHS staff as a thank you for all they are doing. All we ask is they bring ID. We will be asking all other customers to be respectful and to shop in the usual hours.” MS is setting aside its first hour on Tuesdays and Fridays “for our brilliant NHS and emergency workers”. The chain will also be asking for ID to stop stockpilers. Speaking yesterday on ITV’s This Morning Dawn, from York, said she was “overwhelmed” by the response to her plea. She said: “I understand the fear but we are not a Third World country. People need to have a bit of awareness and remember other people actually need to survive this virus.”  Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has repeatedly tried to assure the nation there is no shops supply crisis, said: “I stand with Dawn. I think she has put it better than anybody  could. It’s vital that people act responsibly.” But the message continued to fall on deaf ears as thousands carried on stockpiling. Yesterday, we revealed how stunned shoppers branded panic-buyers “locusts” after shelves were stripped bare, sometimes in  minutes. And we told of how staff were abused over queues and purchase restrictions – while there were even reports of shoppers fighting and attacking workers. The Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Physicians have now urged  major chains to create priority shopping times for all frontline workers. In an open letter referencing Dawn’s video, the RCN said: “Sadly, her experience is far from unique.  “Health and care professionals are faced with empty shelves. Our frontline staff ensure the health and wellbeing of our country and we must do all that we can to support them in their efforts.” Union Unison welcomed the move to help NHS staff. But chief Dave Prentis said: “The time has come for ministers to take more decisive action to avoid key workers and vulnerable people being without food. While some supermarkets must be praised for setting aside time, the initiative is patchy and doesn’t account for sht patterns. More must be done.” According to trade magazine The Grocer, we splurged £million on essentials in the first week of March – compared with £.million last year.  Profiteering off pandemic panic Shops, online retailers and eBay sellers are accused of profiteering from essentials such as toilet paper, baby milk and hand sanitiser. Some shoppers have been spotted buying vast quantities of key items, leading to fears they plan to exploit shortages to make quick profits online. One eBay seller is offering an g tub of Aptamil baby formula milk for £, when it normally retails for around £. They are also selling an “NHS-approved” ml bottle of hand sanitiser for £.. One eBay user posted: “Vile bulk buyer bumping up prices during a pandemic.” Another is selling an g tub of Cow  Gate follow-on milk for £.. One shopper said: “What kind of human being does this at a time when everyone needs to band together ” Another said: “You try to make a profit when some people can’t feed their babies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus shopper shares hand sanitiser","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Shopper shares hand sanitiser shampoo hack after seeing mum in tearsLaurie Lee, a trained biomedical scientist, took to Facebook claiming shampoo could be used as an alternative to hand sanitising gels.

I told her to use shampoo instead. She didnapost believe me that it could be used because itaposs not aposantibacterialapos. For anyone that doesnapost know.

In a message to staff, the hospital said it has no critical care capacity left and has contacted neighbouring hospitals about transferring patients who need critical care to other sites. Although the critical incident was ‘stood down’ on Friday evening, on the same day, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust was also forced to turn patients Covid- away.

In recent years, this expertise has been successfully used in supporting the development of the Ebola vaccine, licensed in . Public Health Englandaposs  Porton Down researchers have collaborated with colleagues at Liverpool and Bristol universities to develop ‘synthetic virus’ – an exact replica of the actual virus for use in the laboratory. This will enable them to carry out rigorous evaluation and testing of vaccines and treatments that enter the clinic. The Times reports that the Phase II trials will begin before the results of the animal trials are known, as the Crisis lurches into its next, dramatic phase.Normally, larger Phase III trials are needed before a drug is clinically approved. In emergencies, however, such trial vaccines are released early for key workers.    The announcement comes as a further  people in England were confirmed to have died after testing positive for Covid-, bringing the UK death toll to . That number is expected to rise today and in the coming weeks.As cases continue to rise Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced sweeping new emergency measures to fight coronavirius - ordering pubs, bars, theatres and restaurants across the country to close.The steps have been brought in in a bid to curb the spread of the virus as experts have cautioned that while the latest announcement about a vaccine is good news it may not be made widely available until next year aposat the earliestapos.

The next stage would be to ramp it up and start looking at whether the vaccine actually can prevent infection in the community.  You need to produce the data to show a vaccine works and how well it works before you can get a licence to sell that as a product.Scientists hope the vaccine - which contains a section of genetic code from the coronavirus - will train the body to attack the virus. The Oxford drug is one of multiple such proto-vaccines in development worldwide, as the number of positive tests worldwide exceeded ,.  Government advisers believe the number of cases could be as many as ,. The team developing the vaccine has been awarded , by the US Food and Drug Administrationto bolster the international response to coronavirus vaccine and treatment development.

Similarly, spending too much time in bed makes it more likely that you’ll feel sleepy during the day, reducing your productivity. It’s already estimated that  per cent of Brits struggle to get a good night’s sleep, according to research by Bensons for Beds. One thing that can help, according to Dr Bostock, who is UK innovation lead for the company Big Health, is making sure you mentally associate your bed with sleep and not your job. Whether you’re firing off emails or writing reports, it’s also important to find somewhere to work which isn’t a dark bedroom, as natural light helps to keep energy levels up. “Exposure to natural light during the day, especially in the morning, also helps to fully wake up your body clock, so that by night time, your body is ready for sleep,” she adds. One study has even found that workers who sit next to a window get  minutes more sleep than those who work away from daylight. Getting up and out of bed is also much better for your back, which in turn will aid a good night’s sleep.  “Reclining on a bed as you curve over a laptop could bring on back pain, which could interfere with your sleep at night,” she continued. It’s recommended that workers decamping to their homes for the coming weeks and months try to set up a dedicated work space similar to their office. Getting out of your pyjamas can also help you make that sht into work mode and help maintain a sense of routine through these unsettling times.

Laura Jacobs, , contracted the virus after her parents ed from Italy in mid-February - going through all the typical symptoms like a high fever, aches, a painfully tight chest and fatigue. While she wants people to take the virus seriously and follow government guidance she also wants to alleviate any worries people may have.Hospital worker, Laura, from Wales, posted on Facebook : “I feel like it’s important to share my story, especially with all of the current panic and unrest going on.“My symptoms came from nowhere. I felt absolutely fine at work and then bang, all of the symptoms arrived at once.I had a high fever, shivers, intense aching pains in my back and neck, sore throat, painfully tight chest and fatigue.”Along with Matthew, five-year-old daughter Ava and -month-old Miles, Laura was tested on Monday, March  - a day after her mother - by a nurse.  Lauraaposs mother Melissa Powell, and husband Matthew also came down with the coronavirus after testing positive at home. She told Wales Online : “I wanted people to see that you shouldn’t take it lightly but also that thereaposs so much negative stuff being reported in the media, I think people just want reassurance.“My mum had been to Italy and went to an area that wasn’t infected at the time, there were no reported cases, they came back on Sunday, February , within three days my mum started showing symptoms and then I caught it off her.” Laura, from Neath, explained that her mother had worse symptoms as she has a history of pneumonia.  She said: “At first I thought I had the flu, I knew it wasn’t a cold. It was much worse, I hadn’t had my flu jab like every other year. “As time went on we saw in the news there were reported cases in the part of Italy they went to and it couldn’t be a coincidence. So, Mam requested a test and was tested positive, that was Sunday March  and on March  - I was tested. At the time they were doing community testing, as only a handful people in Wales were confirmed to have it. A community nurse came to the house in protective clothing, a mask and visor. She tested me, my husband and children at the same time. “It was awful. We did pre-warn my daughter she was okay with she wasn’t thrilled with the throat swab, but they were ok.  “The kids came back as negative and we were surprised because we are round them all the time, giving them hugs and kisses. But that goes to show, people are worried about their kids, I’ve had loads of messages from people, but it seems they are a lot more resilient to it.” Laura said: “I did feel really unwell, I’m healthy, Iaposve never been really really unwell to compare it. The worst was the fever for days, high temp shivers, horrible aching up my back and around my neck, you feel like you can’t move, exhausted. After the fever lted, I started to feel a bit better in myself, it travelled down to my throat so I have a really sore throat and then I had a drier cough which I still have now.

But we just constantly wash hands before feeding and dressing them, anti-baccing door handles, tables remotes and avoiding hugs and kisses. Everything for Miles is sterilized anyway as he’s under one,” Laura said.  “It was hard, it was a little bit scary for my five-year-old. She was told all of a sudden she couldn’t go to school, go out of the house, go up the park and daddy is not well and there’s a nurse coming.” Laura said she has had lots of messages about children and hoped her post would show people the virus, for most people wouldn’t have people unwell forever. “I think people are just really frightened,” said Laura, who hopes that she’ll be able to practically help those coming down with the virus, when she is fully recovered. “ I think it’s because it’s something new and unknown and you have no answers about how long youaposll be ill for, does it get worse, what are the complications and that’s a common thread in the messages I have had.

Professor Irina Sannikova is facing a criminal investigation after she took a holiday to Spain but failed to disclose the trip or self-isolate as required after ing home. Instead, the respected medic allegedly became a super-spreader while attending conferences and meetings with doctors and medical students. Her actions reportedly resulted in at least  people testing positive for coronavirus. Following the revelation, around  people have been tested and another  are now undergoing checks as fellow medics dubbed her a “biological hazard”. Dr Sannikova is the chief infections doctor in Stavropol, an area half as large as England located in southwestern Russia. She was taken ill and diagnosed with coronavirus on Wednesday, six days after flying back from Madrid, and required an articial lung machine. A preliminary criminal case against Dr Sannikova has reportedly already been launched, and itaposs understood she could face up to five years in jail for concealing details of her Spanish holiday, so causing a direct threat to le. Regional governor Vladimir Vladimirov said: “She is an irresponsible person. “When she recovers, I will charge her.” Dr Sannikova, who is in her s, is an internationally recognised medic and leading expert on infectious diseases in southern Russia. Today, her condition was described as “moderately grave” with her le not in danger. Dr Sannikovaaposs was branded “selfish” after it emerged she had appeared on TV to lecture Russians on the importance of the “social responsibility” of self-isolatingthey are suspected to have the virus. “Do not go to work, do not sneeze and cough at others,” she demanded one month ago before her vacation. “Do not use public transport when you are ill. Stay at home.” She added: “It is the social responsibility of the person for their own and othersapos health.” Dr Sannikovaaposs colleague and friend, Dr Olga Golub, defended the professor saying she was “a kind and good person, who has worked in medicine for dozens of years. She added: “She saved hundreds of people.”  As of Friday,  people have tested positive for coronavirus in Russia, with the highest number of cases in Moscow. Russia confirmed its first coronavirus related death on Thursday. The woman, believed to be -years-old, died as a result of a blood clot.

In an anonymous open letter to the world, the nurse admitted she is proud to treat and look after patients battling Covid-. With visiting restrictions now in place at hospitals, meaning many patients can no longer see their loved ones, the nurse said they and their colleagues will do our absolute best for each and every one of you that needs us. The nurse also emotionally described how they said goodbye to their mum this week, not knowing when they will see them again. As we said goodbye I felt my mum was packing me off for war, the nurse said. I guess she was in a funny kind of way. This is a war. And it’s a war I’m ready to fight in. Come at us Covid-, you won’t be met with doctors and nurses, instead you will be met by warriors ready to fight you until the bitter end. As of am on Friday, , people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus, while  patients have died. Itaposs feared thousands more may have the virus, although due to testing restrictions not everyone showing symptoms is being tested.  In Italy the death toll leapt by more than  in one day yesterday. The death toll is now over , - more than China where the outbreak originated at the end of December. Crematoriums in the Lombardy region are full with the army being drafted in to help transport the bodies from the outbreak. Last night pubs, clubs, cafe and restaurants shut in the UK for the foreseeable future with schools also shutdown as the Government wrestles with the unprecedented situation. The death toll and cases figure in the UK is expected to rise once again and further restriction in the coming days and weeks are expected. Letter in full Dear World, As an ICU nurse during this crazy and scary time I thought I would write this letter. This letter portrays the rambling thoughts of one single nurse. However, I’m sure these feelings are felt by so many others. There’s little doubt that Covid- is instilling fear. Everybody has heard about it. Everywhere you look there is news, some of it real news, a lot of it fake news and sadly, little of it good news. However,you look around you will always find a rainbow in the storm. Acts of kindness, messages of hope. When the human race pulls together and supports each other the results are unbelievable. Old bonds will become stronger, new bonds will be made. Friends and family members have asked meI regret my career choice at the moment. I did perhaps regret it… for one split second. Yes we have dficult times ahead but in many ways we are the lucky ones. For starters our jobs are safe, in fact there may well be more work than we can cope with. Secondly, we get to care for people when they’re at their weakest and most vulnerable. Let me tell you, and I know I speak for all nurses, this is one of the biggest honours there is.  With visiting restrictions being put in place we may well become the only people these patients see. We will hold our heads high, put on our biggest smilesand do our absolute best for each and every one of you that needs us. We have machines and gadgets which make even the most advanced Dyson Vacuum Cleaner seem boringand we will use these machines along with the best basic nursing care to give the best chances of survival. Sadly however, we know that we won’t save everybody. A sad fact of our work in ICU is that despite our bestest attempts simply not everybody makes it. This is a fact that’s currently more prominent than ever. Dr Morgan addressed this beautully in his letter. We as nurses echo what he said completely. We won’t forget about you. We will care for you, give you every treatment that is reasonable, laugh with you, cry with you, hold your hands and try and make you feel less scared. We are nurses and this is the core of what we do and it’s what we do best. The fancy machines and drugs are just the added extras.

You can only worry about things you can control # and this situation is definitely out with our control.”The loan signing of Scotland international Christophe Berra from Hearts has made a huge dference.Berra, , was bombed out by Daniel Stendel after the former Barnsley manager’s Tynecastle appointment in December.Forster said: “Big Christophe has done well for us. He’s got a lot of experience and he’s played at a high level so it’s good for defenders like myself to play alongside him.“You can learn loads from a guy like that. We’re similar types of players, we both like to defend first and foremost.“We pride ourselves on clean sheets and things were going reasonably well for us before the shutdown.”Forster – who was in Celtic’s academy before making the senior breakthrough at Hibs – feels he was held back by injuries in the early part of his career and he is delighted to put that frustration behind him.He said: “I feel the best I’ve ever felt physically and mentally.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us.

The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Every year, as the summer faded into autumn, it gave its gt of apples to anyone who happened to pass. Children from the local village who were always hungry would sit under it and eat ripe apples until they had tummy ache. Old folk would come and collect the apples to make pies, sauces and chutney.When the apples from the lower branches had been eaten, the children would climb and pick the ones higher up. It was a game to catch them and put them in a basket.There were so many apples that the older children had to carry the heavy baskets down to the village and shared the apples with everyone.The tree gave so many apples that everyone in the village had as many as they could eat or use. There were always plenty left over on the ground for the animals and insects who also feasted on the fallen ripe fruit. Thankfully nobody owned the tree, it had seeded itself many years ago on the verge of the road that led to the village.Then one year, a traveller arrived just as the apple tree was beginning to bear fruit. He sat under the tree and admired the beauty of it. The apples were ripening in the sun and one of them fell by his feet. He picked it up and ate it. It was crisp and sweet and really delicious.A group of children arrived from the village. ldquoHello mister, they said with a smile, ldquowersquove come to pick apples. They set about picking the most reachable ripe apples, while of course eating some of them in the process.ldquoWhat delicious apples, I must tell my we and children about them, said the traveller as he set off along the road.ldquoHere, said one of the children, holding out a handful of apples. ldquoThese are really ripe, give them to your family. We have more than enough to carry.The traveller smiled. ldquoHow kind, he said. He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

It said it is necessary to cope with ever-tightening budgets and also ongoing costs following the equal pay deal agreed last year.The council has to finance loan deals, which total hundreds of millions, from selling off key assets to City Property and then financing the deal through annual budgets to pay the settlements.A pound million loan was agreed between city Property and Canada Le last October to buy the Riverside Museum, Tollcross International Swimming Centre, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Gorbals Leisure Centre and Toryglen Football Centre and lease back to the council.Another loan for poundm was struck with Legal and General earlier last year and a poundm, -year loan was then agreed with Canada Le Investments in September .There is also a new pay and grading structure to be implemented which will see average salary costs rise. The council admits a new pay and grading structure cannot be put in place ldquowithout signicant costs.In a report to councillors, Carole Forrest, director of governance, said: ldquoThat average earnings will increase appears unavoidable and this, it is suggested, is an inevitable consequence of the decision to settle equal pay.ldquoThe total number of employees and hence the total pay bill is, however, subject to a degree of control.

That requires service reform and these reforms will require access to voluntary redundancy to be successfully delivered.The report adds the councilrsquos current policy provides a redundancy payment of up to  weeksrsquo pay for those with no access to immediate payment of pension and up to  weeksrsquo pay for those who have.Ms Forrest states: ldquoThe purpose of a redundancy scheme is to provide the council with a means to manage its workforce.

It seemed a really simple idea and something I could easily get involved with, said Ms Hamilton.ldquoI had recently spent some time in and out of care homes as my late father had been a resident in one so I just wanted to help.ldquoIt involves picking up a postcard, even a note, and writing a little message and sending it off. The Facebook page for the group makes it very easy as there is a list of care homes involved.ldquoI often commute to Edinburgh so I will pick up a card with a nice picture of the castle or other landmark and write a note about it or my day. Itrsquos just the thought that you are doing something that the residents might get a little bit of enjoyment out of and be able to reminisce.One of the sites involved is Silverburn Care Home, Glasgow. Activities co-ordinator Joanne McWilliam said it is a great initiative and the residents are thrilled when cards arrive.ldquoThe residents really like hearing the stories on postcards and it really cheers them up. Some cards might have a picture of, say, the Queen on them and a little bit of information is written on them. It then leads to the residents reminiscing and opening up, said Ms McWilliam.ldquoIt is something we build into our activities programme. It can be iniduals sending in cards or groups from schools or the Brownies.One of the Postcards of Kindness co-ordinators said word is beginning to spread and they have noticed new people finding their group in the past few days.Louise Baker said: ldquoPostcards of Kindness started le as a small-scale project between my companyrsquos care homes. We wanted to inspire conversations, jog memories and bring smiles into our care homes, and asked for people to send an extra postcard when they went on holiday. We wanted residents to know they were always thought of, and encourage them to chat to staff, family members and one another about things they remembered about holidays.ldquoThe response was phenomenal, to put it mildly. Last year we decided we didnrsquot want to keep those moments to ourselves, and I founded Postcards of Kindness ndash The Group to connect care homes across the country with people who might wish to keep in touch.ldquoOur aim was to keep residents a part of their local communities and beyond, to bring so many opportunities for happy chatting, and to break down barriers of isolation and loneliness.She said that with increasing numbers of care homes in lockdown the group is even more important and already they have seen new members join.Ms Baker added: ldquoRoyal Mail has said it remains safe to send postcards and letters. They are following the advice closely, and state there is no increased risk to care homes from mail received.\""},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-not-knowing-score---ignorance-bliss-comes-happy-football-saturdays","story":"Irsquove lots of blitz spirit advice I want to give you ndash ldquonow is a perfect time to organise your lard ndash but I fear folk will say: ldquoHellrsquos bells, now even that thick bloke is throwing in his tuppence worth.So, I shall forbear. Irsquoll try to take you out of yourselves, which is the best place to be. Looking for reasons to be cheerful, I came up with this: itrsquos Saturday! Not much consolationyoursquore working, I suppose, but for the rest of us itrsquos a hap-hap-happy day, ken The working week is done. The very air smells dferent. The atmosphere is easy-going. For a few fleeting moments, the fortunate few might even seem blessed. And for me, though usually one of the unfortunate many, it just got better because therersquos no football on. You gasp. You splutter. Didnrsquot I mention only last week something about going to the footer I did indoodie. And I will own that I love the game. But I donrsquot often go to the actual matches. Such a lot of shouting and rudeness. No, I prefer watching them on the television. But that adds a trying aspect to the otherwise unalloyed joy that is Saturday.The reason  Because I like to watch the Match of the Day highlights programme at :pm. With its endless back-passing and stling tactics, football is now a horribly dull game to watch for  minutes. But the technicians at Match of the Day do an excellent job of knitting together the best bits.And just because theyrsquore highlights doesnrsquot mean we want to know the scores first. Why would anyone knowingly do that  They wouldnrsquot go to the actual gamesthey knew the scores first, and itrsquos obviously much more exciting to watch the highlights without knowing the results of what yoursquore about to watch.In the information age, itrsquos a struggle not to be informed. Presented with a loop, Irsquove always believed the best place to be is out of it. But everywhere you look folk are shouting the scores at you. So my Saturdays are spent on edge.You canrsquot go into shops selling televisions or computers as they might have the scores on the screens. You have to ignore phone calls from your mates unless you tell them to shut up before they start speaking .You canrsquot listen to live radio broadcasts of Scottish games because the presenter keeps updating you on the scores from England . Why is he doing that  Doesnrsquot he know anything about football fans News websites are a no-no because theyrsquoll often put the score from a big match on the home page. You also have to avoid folkrsquos twitter accounts . In effect, you have to self-isolate electronically.Even before the highlights come on, the preceding programme is the news, and theyrsquoll often end that with a sports bulletin, complete with the scores of games that are about to come on. Bizarre. BBC Alba caught me out with that before a Scottish match a few weeks ago. Thatrsquos the worst of it: you often manage to get through the whole day before falling at the last minute.Some of you might remember the famous Likely Lads episode, where Bob and Terry spend all day trying to avoid the score ndash not knowing the game has been postponed.Well, all the games are postponed now, which will make my Saturdays a lot less stressful. Enjoy your own days, folks. And remember to apologiseyou sneeze on anyone.Way to goI PROMISE not to mention the virus again, other than to point out that one good thing about it is that it has made us all think a lot more about death.I donrsquot want to sound controversial, but I can say categorically that I am against death. Terrible business. And it always has been, as a list of causes of deaths in  from English parishes illustrates.Recently doing the rounds on Twitter, it records  cases of ldquocancer and wolf,  of ldquoexecuted and prest to death, and  of ldquotympany, which my researchers tell me ndash though they admit to guessing ndash is something to do with wind, though more often associated with ruminant animals.Twelve died of ldquoFrench pox ,  from ldquoPlanet , and one from being ldquoaffrighted, poor soul. However, most sympathy went to the sole death from ldquopiles. That was a bummer.Animal magicOK, now Irsquom freaked out. You will recall that last weekrsquos bombshell column reported ious normally horrendous animals becoming tame and liking absolutely nothing more than a good cuddle, usually after being reared or saved by humans.Lions, tigers, birds of prey, creatures that are by any objective standard evil, turn out enjoy nothing more than a good snuggle.And, in that vein, now Irsquove seen it all: a shark showing affection to a man. Its eyes actually roll with pleasure as the chapgreets and strokes it. Itrsquos been going on for  years ever since the bloke removed some hooks from the beast.More and more, Irsquom beginning to feel that all creatures are trapped in roles that maybe they didnrsquot or wouldnrsquot want ndash killing other creatures to survive themselves in a system devised by a sadistic god.But something profound is now going on, presaging perhaps a new relationship between humans and animals. Therersquos growing evidence that itrsquos definitely happening: a world in which all the creatures get on. Wouldnrsquot that be marvellous My Dirk secretIrsquoVE complained before about being a Robert because it induces multiple personality. One isRobert, Robbie, Rob, Rab, Rabbie, Bob, Bobby, and Bertie. Rabbie is usually lobbed at me by bairns, Rob by English friends trying to civilise me, Rab by Scottish pals ensuring I donrsquot get ideas above my station, and Bertie by fellow fansof PG Wodehouse.The whole thing is a thundering nuisance. You should just get one name and thatrsquos the end of it. Irsquod much rather have been christened Dirk or Aragorn, but what can you do The National Records of Scotland has revealed that Jack was the most popular name for boys and Sophie for girls in the decade to .

We are a step before people go to see their GPs. Obviously that direct route isnt available to them at this point, so we have seen an unprecedented number of people which brings obvious risks.\"Mr Burton says they have had to adapt such as limiting the number of people allowed in at a time and even asking people to keep their distance when queuing.He added: \"We are having to radically change the way we are working. Our work tends to be face to face and may have to examine someone for an ear infection - you cant do that at a distance. In some cases we are asking people who come in, and maybe showing signs of illness, to speak to us over the phone. However with something like a condition such as cellulitis. You cant let these things go undiagnosed as in extreme cases for example that could lead to sepsis which could mean the use of an intensive care bed - which then leads to more pressures in hospitals at this time.\"Mr Burton said people are preparing for a potential period of lockdown and are naturally concerned about continuation of their medicine.He added: \"I think the key message for the public here is not to over order. We can keep the medical supply chain going there is resilience in supply.\"In terms of the types of medicine people can buy over the counter we would just advise them to buy what we are being told is the self-isolation period which is either seven days of  days dependingyou are on your own or with others.

We had planned to go to London by train in early April for a short city break. Planning well ahead, we had booked train tickets via Trainline several months in advance. Given current circumstances, we decided several days ago to cancel our trip. On consulting the Trainline website, we discovered that our tickets are \"non-refundable\" and that to avoid losing all of our money we should re-book for a later date, ie within the next  weeks. Given present uncertainty, I think that might be slightly optimistic. In addition, when I looked at possible alternative dates I was horried to discover that replacement tickets would be more than double what we had originally paid.There is a wonderful community spirit springing up all around us as we attempt to cope with the new reality of coronavirus. The media are providing daily reports of selfless behaviour which restores your faith in humanity. It is extremely disappointing that a major organisation such as Trainline has failed to recognise the spirit of the times.Rob Kelly, Bearsden.IT was heartening to read Stewart MacPhersons letterabout protection for frontline staff ndash ie, pharmacists. I believe Public Health England has started to recognise that pharmacists and staff are needing protection and I hope that the NHS will follow suit. As local GP surgeries are asking patients not to attend to pick up prescriptions it falls back on pharmacy and pharmacy drivers to help out.With the general panic, shortage of some medicines and staff having to isolate we need help with protection and trained staff to bridge the gap.

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a81a8305-8941-4184-938b-d8cf49594400-e1584361711502.png","title":"keep the virtual presses rolling by subscribing to our e papers","story":"OVER the coming weeks, as the Coronavirus crisis most likely deepens, our priority will be to ensure our communities stay safe and healthy.As newspapers based in the heart of vibrant communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we recognise our special role in providing a measured, vital news service to our readers.We also have an obligation to bolster small businesses — the advertising backbone of our papers — who face uncertain times.Already many of those small businesses have either signicantly reduced their operations or, in the case of many entertainment venues, closed their doors for at least two weeks.That in turn will mean a precipitous drop in the display advertising revenues we depend on to keep thepresses rolling, pay staff and meet our overheads.One way in which you can support our teams is by taking out a subscription to our epapers.

With numbers of breeding adults standing at less than half their s total, this decrease is happening at a much slower rate in Northern Ireland. In fact, the BTO says some colonies are instead showing a long-term increase. During  the kittiwake population increased across all sites, with colonies on the Gobbins clf path and nearby Muck Island in Co Antrim faring particularly well. Their numbers increased by % and % respectively when compared to .Razorbills also had a good year, with the birds being recorded in their highest numbers since records began at Muck Island, while guillemots had their best year since .But it wasn#t good news for all the province#s seabirds.The report shows that fulmar numbers are continuing to decline, as well as the black guillemot on Rathlin Island, our best known seabird haven.The island, which is an RSPB reserve, is open to the public, and boasts the only local pair of breeding chough, and more recently, corncrake.May is the best time to see swathes of guillemots, kittiwakes, puffins, fulmars, shags, and gannets and chicks nesting on bare ledges in full view. This is the seventh edition of the report, the outcome of the work of the Northern Ireland Seabird Network of volunteers, overseen by the BTO on behalf of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency .Report author Dr Katherine Booth Jones says the annual recording of seabird numbers by volunteers is vital for capturing the long-term changes in the breeding seabird population, and alerting policy makers to the need for vital conservation action.Dr Booth Jones said: The Northern Ireland Seabird Network is a special collaboration between volunteer seabird surveyors, the BTO, NIEA, RSPB and the National Trust, without whom we could not follow the fates of our seabirds in these changing times. While we have seen winners and losers in , seabird counts at colonies can y year-to-year depending on weather conditions and timings, which makes the annual recording of seabird numbers by our volunteers particularly valuable to capture long-term changes in Northern Ireland.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadAnnual audit of seabird population reveals ups and downs for speciesBlack honeybee back from the brink of extinctionWalk of the Week:Lough ShannaghWhat’s that bird Northern Ireland#s very own Jurassic Coast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was bizarre... my le seems to be shaped by geopolitical disasters.About nine months ago, his team at Boston Children#s Hospital received a €m federal government grant to help develop an influenza vaccine for elderly people and children.However, the Co Wicklow man had been keeping a close watch on coronavirus developments in China, and three months ago his team got government approval to turn it into a dual project.There are now dozens of projects worldwide working around the clock to create a coronavirus vaccine, but Dr Dowling is co-leading a project which is specically targeting the most vulnerable in society - the elderly.Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with Covid-, according to the World Health Organisation.Together with Dr Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines programme at the hospital, Dr Dowling is designing a coronavirus vaccine that uses special molecules to boost the immune system.The coronavirus gets its name because each cell is covered with spiky formations that make it look like a crown, or in Latin #corona#. These are called spike proteins.The vaccine will use the virus#s spike protein along with known vaccine adjuvants - small molecules that increase a patient#s immune response.He and Dr Levy#s team have taken blood samples from patients aged between  and , are separating their white blood cells and testing dferent adjuvants to see which work best.The unique vaccine will build on vaccines from prior coronavirus outbreaks and work to make them more effective.I reached out to Dr Peter Hotez at Texas Children#s Hospital and we got his Sars antigen from the  outbreak, Dr Dowling said.He made a vaccine and never got it all the way into clinical trials and ran out of funding as it [Sars] wasn#t an issue any more.So using the current Sars vaccine and mixing it with our best adjuvant, we hope it can make a dference.As for a timeline on when the vaccine may be ready, Dr Dowling says it largely depends on funding.I spent  hours filling out a grant application for this coronavirus project, when that time could be spent far more practically, he said.Dr Dowling thinks developing a vaccine is imperative, as he believes coronavirus could become a seasonal virus.I do believe that it may have been circulating for a long time and has only come to the forefront now, he said.Right now we are heading towards the peak of it, people are social distancing and we#ll see it relax coming into summer, but there is a distinct possibility it could come back again in winter.That#s why we have to keep working and can#t take time off.

Eileen with her daughter Siobhan on Siobhan’s wedding day, wearing the blue outfit she had wanted to be buried inCatherine FeganMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEileen O’Neill knew death was approaching. She had been in isolation since last Friday, shunted away from the people she loved and desperately frightened by everything she could see around her.Faceless figures in biohazard suits, double-gloved hands checking her pulse, knowing glances behind medical-grade goggles.She was lucid and conscious, right up to the very end, in the solitary company of a virus she had feared would come for her long before it did.“Mum had told me she was afraid of getting it,” her daughter Siobhan said.“For her to get it and then be put in isolation was extremely frightening for her. I know she was scared. I know that. That’s the reality of this virus. You can’t be with someone you love when they need you. All the normal things you do when someone is sick and approaching the end, like mopping their brow, holding their hand, whispering into their ear, you can’t do any of that and that person is completely alone.”Less than a week ago, -year-old Eileen, a glamorous, independent woman who had overcome numerous health battles, entered an isolation ward in St Vincent’s hospital, Dublin.She had fallen ill at home in Loughlinstown and paramedics recorded a high temperature. She was immediately tested for Covid-.Eileen was put in an isolation ward and her family were not allowed to visit. Her test result on Sunday was positive.“When I got the call from the hospital I knew straight away that was it,” said Siobhan. “I knew it would take more than a miracle to pull her through this. I askedhad she been told and they initially said no. I was relieved to hear that because she herself was so frightened of Covid and I knew it would have a negative effect on her. And then there was the fact we couldn’t be with her, I knew that would compound things.”From that point on, Eileen O’Neill’s end-of-le journey took a path her heart-broken loved ones had to send her on alone. The protocols were clear. Under no circumstances could any family members go to see her. Instead, communication would be done by phone. Two years away from turning , Eileen was still working off an “old brick mobile”. There would be no Facetime, no picture exchanges.“It was extremely dficult,” said Siobhan. “But we knew how serious the virus was and that we had to abide by the rules.”For Siobhan Cullen and her family, the news that Eileen had become infected with the deadly virus came as a shock. Due to her underlying respiratory issues, all the necessary precautions had been taken to ensure she was protected long before any cases were recorded here.“She was completely immobile due to a previous stroke,” said Siobhan.“The past two weeks she gave no indication that there was anything wrong with her, apart from being tired. We were all very, very cautious around her. She hadn’t been out of the house since February and she had only seen five people, all of whom had been taking precautions. Her two carers have tested negative for the virus and the other three people, including me, were all family.”Alone, frightened and unaware of the growing pandemic claiming lives across the world, Eileen counted down the hours in silence.“She was alone,” said Siobhan.“I know she was getting the best care, but I also know there was no one sitting beside her. I know she was looking at all those people coming and going, suited and booted, and she would have known why. That’s heart-breaking for me to think about.”Last weekend, as the nation got to grips with a sweeping set of measures, Siobhan remained at home, powerless. She was now in self-isolation, following the advice of her GP, waiting to be tested. Updates on her mother’s condition were regular, but she knew there was an increasing climate of caution. She began to make plans for the possibility that her mother might not survive.“I asked the staff at St Vincent’s Hospitalwe would be allowed to get in to see herit came to the end,” she said. “Through no fault of anyone, the protocols on this are changing on the hour. One lady I spoke to said yes, arrangements would be made... and the next time when she[Eileen] was moved I was told there were no guarantees. That was hard for me to hear.”By Tuesday, Eileen had been moved closer to a nurses’ station where she could be monitored evermore closely. The following day, Siobhan got a call, asking her to come to see her mother.“I knew it was time. Nothing prepares you for what you have to do to see a loved one dying from this.”In an isolated area behind a reception desk, Siobhan and her brother Kenneth took instruction from two nurses and a doctor on how to robe up for entry into the isolation unit: covers over their shoes a full- gown with full sleeves two pairs of gloves, one placed over the other. Each step of the way, washing their hands.That was just the start.“There is a beanie-type hat for your head that you tie at the back,” recalled Siobhan. “You have a facemask but it’s not the normal facemask that you tie at the back. It’s much tougher and it completely seals your mouth and nosetotally. It expands as you breathe.“You have a pair of goggles and then over the goggles you put on a full facial visor. They have hand gel there and at every step you are washing your hands as well. My mum was totally conscious when we walked in like that.”As they were guided along a corridor, Siobhan and Kenneth were told that once they were with their mother, they could not touch her face, but were permitted to hold her hand. “I was very conscious thatwe didn’t abide by that we wouldn’t be let in.“That was my big fear because the protocols were changing daily. I was just so happy to get to see her that I didn’t want to put a foot wrong.“My brother couldn’t stay. He just couldn’t do it. We had to tell her who we were, but that wasn’t because she wasn’t conscious or didn’t recognise us, it was because everyone looked the same.”Faced with a situation that was growing ever more beyond her control, Siobhan decided not to tell her mother that she was nearing the end of her le.“I just didn’t want to frighten her,” she said.“I didn’t want her to know why I was there, and when she asked I just said that I got fed up not being able to hold her hand. The doctor played along. I think that deep down my mum knew why I was there. I know in my heart that she knew the truth, but she went with it.”As day turned to night, Siobhan kept vigil at her mother’s bedside, listening as she struggled to breathe, but clung to le. Anything that went into the room could not go out, so she had no mobile phone and was unable to communicate with family.“I stayed all night,” she said. “I was there, in all that gear, holding her hand. I talked to her all night long, about my dad, about when we were young, about her grandkids. I talked and talked and talked. I told her daddy was waiting for her. I said rosaries out loud, rosaries in my head.“She kept telling me to go home. Her breathing was very poor and deteriorating. She was literally fighting for a breath. At one stage she said to me, ‘Do you think I’ll pull through this ’ I said, ‘I don’t think so, Mam’.”It was a lonely night, recalled Siobhan. She had kept vigil before beside people who had died and the reassuring visit of a nurse on those occasions, in and out in a show of support, had always been a comfort. Covid- denied her any such humanity.“I was so aware that no one could come in,” said Siobhan. “You don’t have the staff coming in and out to check on you or comfort you. Nobody was coming in unless they absolutely had to. It was so cold and clinical.”Eileen passed away shortly after pm on Wednesday. She struggled until the very end.“She had a horrendous death,” said Siobhan. “When she died, I sat with her for an hour, holding her hand and then I had to be pragmatic about what would happen next. I knew there was a chance we wouldn’t get her personal belongings back so I had to remove all her jewellery and take it there and then. It sounds so mercenary but that’s what I had to do.”The most dficult conversations came next. Siobhan was told that her mother’s body would be “double bagged” in a high-spec body bag. Eileen would not be taken to the chapel of rest, but instead to a specially designated area in the morgue.“The staff there had to leave. The people who met us had to be gowned. We couldn’t touch her, and we got  minutes with her. I want people to understand how devastating that was.”This week, as she self-isolated, Siobhan prepared for her mother’s burial in circumstances that are hard to believe.Consultations with the undertaker have had to be done via video-link. Mourners have not been able to call to her home. Grief is being held in suspension while Covid- tightens its grip over a family in a very surreal time of despair.“Death is very much a part of le,” said Siobhan. “Here in Ireland, we commemorate the dead so well. For us, trapped at home at the mercy of this virus, there are no arms to fall into for a hug. My friends can’t come and pay their respects. We can’t come together and mourn. People need to understand the devastating domino effect of this virus and all that it brings to your door.”Struck down by coronavirus at the age of , the long le of Eileen O’Neill will today end with a short ceremony at a funeral parlour in Dublin.It will not be the ending she wanted. Her funeral wishes, expressed long ago to her nearest and dearest, included carefully selected hymns and readings. She had picked out the flowers, the gts, the pallbearers. She wanted to be dressed in the navy outfit she wore to Siobhan’s wedding.None of that will be possible. Today, in a small funeral home in Dublin, four people will gather to say their farewells. Communion will be passed around on tissue paper. There will be no burial Mass.“This virus is vicious, and it leaves people to die an extremely lonely death. My mother will be buried with just four of us present. Her coffin will have to be disinfected after we leave her and none of us can grieve with our wider family and friends because we have to self-isolate until we are tested.“This is the cruellest end to a le.” In memory of Eileen, Siobhan is asking readers to consider donating to Feed The Heroes herePlease log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Independent.ie  Related ContentCoronavirusFunerals should be held in private, mourners urgedChurches here are urging their clergy to hold all funerals in private because of the coronavirus crisis.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Social distancing is vital to combat the spread of Covid-, the PSNI said.In other parts of Northern Ireland some continued to ignore the advice.While most cafes, restaurants and pubs in Londonderry adhered to government recommendations, in neighbouring towns of Coleraine, Portrush and Portstewart, for some it was business as normal.Serving staff in bars, cafes and restaurants cannot keep two metres from members of the public while carrying out their job and remain safe, which helped many owners make the decision to shut up shop.Derry City Centre manager Jim Roddy said: Some businesses including restaurants are being imaginative and have adjusted their businesses in ways that don#t put their staff or the public at risk and keep to the principles of safe distancing.A spokeswoman for the Causeway Chamber of Commerce said its members were looking to the Government for clarity on the issue of opening.She said: Council has no power to direct premises to close or enforce social distancing.It is the responsibility of everyone to follow the relevant guidance and once again we would urge everyone to play their part in the fight against Covid-.A leading retail chief called on the public to follow the clear guidelines as lives depend on it.Retail NI#s Glyn Roberts also called on the Executive to set up a single Covid--related website and social media channel to make sure the right messages are getting across to the public.It#s been made very, very clear that we all need to follow the advice, he said. We simply have to. Lives depend on it and that message has to get through.That#s why Retail NI will be asking the Executive to set up a specic website and social media channel to make sure the correct and relevant advice is there for all.At the minute advice is coming from all dferent departments and there#s so much out there that#s irrelevant or wrong.

We#re really seeing the benefit social media can have in getting information across, but it needs to be from a single, coordinated source.We really have to follow to the letter what the advice is. We have those who are working in the retail trade, the people serving us in shops to think of as well.They are providing an invaluable service by remaining open and we owe it to them all to abide by the rules as much as we possibly can.The Public Health Agency also warned of the threat posed by Covid-the social distancing guidelines are not followed.Dr Van Woerden said: We understand that this will be dficult, particularly with Mother#s Day this weekend for example, so it is worth looking at keeping in touch using your phone, the internet and social media.If you are outdoors, stay more than two metres away from others.As part of the effort to reduce the spread, only use the phone or online facilities to contact your GP or other essential services.We strongly advise you to follow the measures as much as you can and to signicantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and familypossible, particularlyyou are over , have an underlying health condition or are pregnant.Scientists said social measures will need to be in place for most of a year at least in order to control the spread of Covid-.The Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling agreed on Monday that, while the severity of measures could alternate during the period, stricter measures would need to be enforced for at least half of the year to keep cases at a level the NHS can cope with.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Keep your distance... a simple rule, but too many ignoring itTributes paid after popular Ballyclare HS teacher Dr Austin Millar diesCoronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Ballycastle is best place to live in Northern Ireland, claims guideKincora files destroyed as institutional abuse inquiry was set in motion,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We thank you for the many times you put us before yourselves to prepare us for our final exams and in everyday le at school. All of your hard work will never be forgotten, and we are sad we cannot go in and smash those final exams and do you proud in the ways we have done in the past. “To our friends and school community, thank you. We thank you for the many years of friendship, all the laughter and all of the memories. We didn’t expect it to be cut short so soon, but it has. Now we need to look after each other and do all we can to help the most vulnerable at this very trying time. “To the NHS workers and everyone on the frontline who is looking after us all at this traumatising time and risking their own lives doing so, a ‘thank you’ will never be enough for you. What you are doing and continue to do is simply amazing and it is dficult to express our gratitude to you in words but thank you. “To the superheroes who aren’t wearing capes in our community and across the globe right now who are running errands for the most vulnerable, even just checking up on people self-isolating down the road, getting people their prescriptions, delivering supplies to those in need and just being selfless incredible people – we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “To those who have been left unemployed because of this pandemic or those who are struggling financially at this dficult time, we have you in our thoughts and prayers. We will get through this, but onlywe work together. Thank you for remaining strong and calm. Never forget that there is light at the end of the tunnel. “To the vulnerable, the elderly and those at high-risk of catching COVID- or those currently suffering – please be strong. You are in our thoughts and prayers. You will get through this have faith… we believe in you. “To those in the world at this time helping turn adversity into advantage – we see you and you are amazing. To those businesses who are putting need over profit at this dficult time by offering food to those less able, by setting up community initiatives to give back to the community who give to you you are making the world a better place and the world sends you a great amount of gratitude. “To everyone who has been affected by COVID-, directly or indirectly… in the words of Buzz Lightyear, “The important thing is that we stick together.” “Let’s stick together. Let’s unite as one and let’s show the world that we can be kind, caring and compassionate. Let’s do that now before it’s too late. Let’s love one another and hold our loved ones close because tomorrow is never promised.”Jamie’s desktop calendar, containing daily quotes, raised over £, for charity after going on sale before Christmas last year.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related ContentCoronavirusPay docked from striking Northern Ireland health workers to be reinstatedThree days# pay taken from striking health service workers in Northern Ireland will be reinstated, Stormont#s Deputy First Minister said. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Keep your distance... a simple rule, but too many ignoring itTributes paid after popular Ballyclare HS teacher Dr Austin Millar diesCoronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Ballycastle is best place to live in Northern Ireland, claims guideKincora files destroyed as institutional abuse inquiry was set in motion,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There, I’ve said it. It wasn’t that hard really. The truth is that I don’t always wear my Catholic badge with pride. There are things that I like and dislike about the Catholic Church, but I am a practising Catholic, and in a world where that isn’t always the coolest thing to say, I don’t mind saying it, out loud.I’ve always been a believer, I was raised in a devoutly Catholic family. I remember the pride in my parents’ faces at church when a woman pointed at me and my brother and sisters, and said she’d never seen a family so well-behaved at Mass.My faith had good foundations because of the people around me. My earliest memory of church is being taken to Benediction with my granny, nose pressed to the seat in front of me as I knelt, listening to the priest recite lines and lines of Latin phrases that I couldn’t understand. The memory of my granny’s wrinkled hand in mine guiding me through the Rosary beads, and the smell of incense is as real to me now, as it was then.As a teenager, I went to Mass every night, something I kept a closely-guarded secret from all my friends. I didn’t want to be called a Holy Joe. While my friends were all getting part-time jobs in what was the newly-opened Foyleside in the early s, my first job was in the priests’ house, where there was always a stack of black shirts that needed ironed.After moving to Belfast in  to attend Queen’s University, my faith seemed to drt. I did attend a few events in the University Catholic Chaplaincy, but the freedom of living away from home and the pub culture meant my churchgoing took a hit.It didn’t bother me. I attended Mass sporadically over the years – Christmas, weddings, funerals, and whenever my parents forced me to. I hadn’t stopped believing, but that need to go to Mass just wasn’t there anymore. I suppose as I’ve got older I had been thinking about my faith more, and a chance opportunity to attend Lough Derg in  changed everything for me. I was working as a journalist and was asked to attend with a group of pilgrims from the Derry Diocese along with Bishop Donal McKeown. I thought nothing more of it than that it would make a good story.The three days I spent on the island ended up being much more than research for a newspaper article. The peace of Lough Derg, and the break from the constant distraction of the modern world gave me the space to reconnect with my faith. I hadn’t been to Confession for over  years believing it to be outdated and unnecessary, but at Lough Derg, I experienced a new, grown-up type of confession that dfered from my childish practice of rhyming off sins.Now, aged , I hope I have a much more mature attitude to my faith. I don’t hide the fact that I go to Mass, because I really don’t care what other people think about that.But being a Catholic, and someone who is not afraid to say they are a Catholic comes with its own challenges. The Church has been through dficult years with issues that can never be brushed under the carpet. Friends of mine have told me they’ll neverto Mass because they’ll never trust the Church again. Many of my friends, while they don’t share my faith, have the deepest respect for it. On a recent weekend away to England with buddies, I announced on the Saturday night that I was going to find a chapel to go to Mass. Instead of going alone, I ended up taking ten people along with me.Having faith isn’t always something that comes naturally – there are days when I feel I’m just going through the motions and doubting everything, and there are other days when I feel completely connected to God.I know that in the most dficult situations in my le I have felt God’s presence with me. That can sometimes be a dficult statement to make, when being a card-carrying Catholic and a woman of faith is something that is so easily ridiculed in modern society. I can’t say I do, or will ever agree with all aspects of the Catholic Church. The Church has much work to do. More recognition must be given to the vital role played by women, and I hope some day that church will be more accepting of same-sex relationships. I’ve seen first-hand the upset caused to my gay friends who have felt abandoned by the church. My faith will always be important to me. Because I’m so vocal about it, I’m often stopped by people who ask me to pray for a special intention for them, light a candle, or even asked where is the nearest place they can buy a Mass card  Faith is something that should be cherished. I feel hugely grateful for having it in my le. I enjoy volunteering for my parish by the little bits and pieces I do to help. I am very grateful for the people around me who respect my faith, and those who share it with me. I suppose I still fear the Holy Joe label, because I know I’m far from a Holy Joe, but I suppose there are worse things I could be called. googletag.cmd.push Erin Hutcheon is PR and marketing officer with the North West Regional College.

I came up with an idea for an initiative to try to promote a more positive perspective for people at what feels like a very dark time for everyone. Its my suggestion that, while we remain in this time of social distancing, people place a set of Christmas lights in a front window of their home to promote a feeling of togetherness, mutual support and as a gesture of gratitude for all those who are out there still working to help all us through this dficult time.She believes this simple gesture could have a powerful effect, especially for children.At night when we look out and see the lights twinkling from our neighbours windows, well be reminded that were all in this together and united in our support for one another. It will also be symbolic of our hope and a reminder that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. googletag.cmd.push This message and initiative is particularly important for children who, while they seem to be relatively unaffected by this virus health-wise, can be massively affected by anxiety, both their own and that of the people around them.Ms Doherty has set up an instagram page Light Up Initiative where people have already been sharing pictures of their lit up windows. Its such an important message so Im encouraging everyone to continue share the light @lightupinitiative, she added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like many others at present, the drama student at Ulster University’s Magee Campus is working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic but her mind is firmly focussed on the task at hand on Saturday night. She’s having ‘withdrawal symptoms’ from not seeing her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila, who have also become household names thanks to their guest appearance on the show. googletag.cmd.push But Brooke has been calling them on a regular basis and wants to ensure they’re kept safe.  The -year-old is from Bellaghy Co. Derry but lived in the Rosemount area for two years while studying and has family connections in the city. Her love of music developed at home, growing up her father ‘almost burnt the house down’ when he fell asleep as a child listening to the record player. None of her family are singers but they’re all passionate about music and listen to the ‘golden oldies’. Brooke’s own taste has been informed by those cherished records and she’s been fortunate enough to see idols live such as Dolly Parton, Cher and Tina Turner. Other favourites include the Eagles, Aerosmith and John Mayer. googletag.cmd.push She never envisaged a career in music - ‘every competition I entered I never got through, except from one year at Ballymena Festival which I won’, she said. Unbeknown to Brooke a friend submitted an application of her to audition for The Voice UK . She was shocked to get call back from the producers before going across to England in April last year, where she secretly filmed her Blind Audition – an experience shrouded in secrecy from her wider friends and family. AFFIRMATION  At the beginning of January Brooke’s first appearance was aired on ITV. All four coaches were visibly moved by her performance. First to turn were will.i.am and Meghan Trainor and they were quickly followed by Sir Tom Jones and Olly Murs. A tug-of-war took place between the coaches but American singer-songwriter Ms Trainor convinced the Derry woman to join her team and quickly declared that she had a potential winner on her hands. That cover of Lewis Capaldi song Bruises was a breakthrough moment and one that changed her outlook. “I’m so grateful for everything because it really has shown me that by getting turns from all the coaches, it has reassured me and reaffirmed everything that I want to do, it has given me that push and urge to say, ‘I should be doing this, I will do it and be as good as I can’.” It has already proven a seminal moment in her le and one which she now uses as motivation. “I watch that back on my phone when I’m going to perform on the show again, “ she reflected. “It gives me that lt and belief that I was worth the four chair turn. “I genuinely didn’t think it was a good performance of that song because as soon as they turned I went into panic mode. I’ve sung it so much better. “But the crowd were standing applauding, it was a surreal moment and one I’ll never forget.” Directly after the performance the -year-old’s sense of humour shone through, while speaking to the coaches she joked to Tom Jones and Olly Murs that her grannies were both single. Her own harshest critic, Brooke also wasn’t happy with her performance during the Battles round and views this Saturday night as an opportunity to redeem herself. Saturday’s Knockout performance is set to be special as she sings a song that is close to her heart. “It’s a song with a lot of meaning for me, it was the first song people heard me sing in school and has had a lot of luck for me. I hope it does again on Saturday,” she added. ROLE MODEL The reaction in her hometown and further afield has been humbling and spurred her on. She explained: “People have been so supportive, particularly over the last few days when I’ve noticed my social media followers going up. “To think that people want to listen to me is amazing. I’m so glad I have the local support and want people to be proud of me and able to relate to me because I live in the same place.” A woman of many talents she also plays camogie having represented the county team and Bellaghy’s senior team. She shares the interest in sport with family members including her younger brother and two older sisters. However, The Voice remains her primary focus at present with her time split between Derry and London. If she didn’t grasp the opportunity with both hands and devote herself to it entirely she feels it would always be a source of regret.  Brooke said she may be biased but believes choosing Meghan Trainor as her coach was the ‘best decision’ because they share a lot of similarities. “She FaceTimes me, messages me on Instagram, she is unbelievable and is here to make a point. I believe she’ll look after me in my career and is just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” Although only nearing her st birthday, the young Derry woman has ambitions of pursuing a career in music, or acting, regardless of the outcome on Saturday night. “I want to act, I want to sing, I want to bake, everything that comes at me I want to say yes because you never know what will come out of it. “I just want to help people, I want to give them something that takes them away from their worries. “It’s about growing as a person and artist, and being a good role model to young people who are looking up to me most, like Meghan has been for so many - that would be my dream achieved.” Tune into The Voice on ITV this Saturday at :pm as Brooke takes on the Knock Outs for a place in the Live Semi Final. The semi-final and final which were due to air on March  and April  have now been postponed until later this year.

So why not take the opportunity to watchsome classic films on Netflix. Our suggestions below arent necessarily suitable for younger viewers but will keep the adults entertained. Blade Runner A truly classic science fiction filmdirected byRidley Scott and starringHarrison Ford,Rutger HauerandSean Young. The Crying Game Neil Jordan’s  hit was a success at the time and it boasts one of the most surprising twists in the tail in any film. googletag.cmd.push GoodFellas Martin Scorsese’s  masterpiece is a must watch film about the Mafia with an all star cast including Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. GroundhogDay A brilliant  comedy where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over again.... Funny and fitting for the situation we find ourselves in.

Seven years later, he would be the first Maghera senior footballer to lt silverware after their MacLarnon Cup win over Omagh CBS. Back to back Ulster minor winner Laverty played on the Derry senior team of the mid-s, picking up two senior medals. His first cousin and godfather Colm Mulholland, who turned  in December played for Derry in the  All-Ireland final. Lavertys Derry senior debut came by chance. Jim McGuigan was organising the transport to Sligo for the opening game of the pre-Christmas section of the   league. googletag.cmd.push He asked Lavertyhe wanted to go to the game on the bus, just to watch. After all the ious pick up points passed, there were only  players on board, including Anthony McGurk who was nursing a sore ankle. “Do you want to play,” McGuigan asked in the direction of Laverty. Before he had a chance to reply, manager Paddy OHara told McGuigan to get him togs and socks a pair of boots from somewhere. “So there I was playing my first game. I remember the game was moved to Tobercurry, because of a waterlogged pitch. We won the game and remember Michael Kearns was playing for Sligo.” googletag.cmd.push It would be a further four years before he would make his championship debut. During that time, as a student at St Joes in Belfast, he won an All-Ireland Fresher medal and three Ryan Cupmedals. Regrettably, despite having a team capable of winning the Sigerson, the Ranch werent permitted to enter. With his native Lavey, he played for over  years, winning two championships, but for the last  years he calls Portrush his home. Every day, he will walk down the Coleraine Road to the shop, passing back over from County Antrim to his native Derry. He will pass the home of John Eddie Mullan, a league winner with the Oakleafers in , and the pair would often chat. Last week, when Lavertys phone rang and the opportunity arose to rake up the memories of  again, there was an excitement in his voice. Last year he had the thyear gathering of the  minor winning team that were defeated by Cork in All-Ireland final. “Brendan Kelly, Mickey Moran, Vincent Conway, Frankie McCotter and myself were on that team,” Laverty remembers. “The MacLarnon Cup final was a really good game of football compared to the MacRory which was dour and not very interesting.” Martin ONeill, who would later that year play alongside Laverty for Derry minors, played on the winning St Malachys team, managed by Phil Stuart, that lted the MacRory Cup. “Hugh Cudden, our goalkeeper, is now in Canada and Liam Harbinson is away in South Africa or Zimbabwe and Frankie McCotter lives in London.” Laverty scored one goal in the final with Harbinson, who played some Irish league soccer, notching the other, after dribbling clear of Omagh defence. “Liam is a relation of Sean OConnell and had a swagger like Sean OConnell. He was a very good soccer player, as was Mickey Moran. Playing in the school playground, you would know they had a bit of skill from soccer about them.” In those days, as Laverty remembers, organised games against other schools didnt come into vogue until third or fourth year. “What struck out for me, when we started in St Pats Maghera, there was only  pupils at it. We went into the assembly hall, there was no floor in it, we were standing on the grass as the school wasnt totally finished. “Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt took us in the early years. Then we had Sean Murphy and Eamon Small coaching us as well.” There were few highlights of the football in the early years but soon there was a greater enthusiasm and more boys were taking an interest. Frankie Kearney left the staff, going to St Pauls Kilrea. McKevitt went back to teach in the Abbey. Sean Murphy, with Jim B Bradley assisting him, took over the running of the senior team. “It was brilliant,” enthuses Laverty. “We were the first senior team and got Maghera into the MacRory. Adrian Boyle was still at Maghera the following year and remembers playing in the MacRory. “It was a fantastic feeling to win it and Omagh had a great team at that time. It was a ding dong game. We had a good team and were all very determined to win on that day.” Laverty was the captain and refers to manager Sean Murphys qualities in the classroom being transferred to the dressing room. “He was a good teacher and then he was a good manager as well. Everybody wanted to play for him. He had a good way of getting things across and he was a good motivator, you wanted to play for him.” Another ingredient for success, which Laverty mentions, was the school basketball team. Under the watch of Charlie Murphy, they won the Ulster title, with a - win over Methody. “It was up in San Souci Park, in Queens,” he adds, with the details floating down the phone-line asit were yesterday. There was a hiccup before the final. Maghera didnt have numbers on their vests and wouldnt be allowed to compete until a local intervention saved the day. St Colms Draperstowns U team were there and coach Seamus Kelly, loaned them their vests. Kelly, who passed away recently, would have an influence on Lavertys Derry career under Frankie Kearneys tenure. “Seamus was a shrewd man and was one of the mentors of Derry teams of ,  and . Sean OConnell would have been helping out with training – while still playing – and big Liam Hinphey was the motivator. Seamus Kelly was the tactician, he was very quiet but was shrewd operator.” “Methody came out in silk tops and togs, with all their fancy numbers. The vests we got were as tight as a fiddle string and too small for us. “There was a Methody boy who got a few tackles that day, that werent part of basketball, but thats another story,” added Laverty, with a hearty laugh. On the basketball starting team of five, were Mickey Moran and Eugene Laverty. Tommy McCloy of Lavey was another footballer but would leave school before the MacLarnon winning season. Also at the school during that era was current Lavey man Paddy Shivers, who went on to play for Derry as well. Laverty cant understand why Shivers wasnt on the Maghera team at that time. “I wasnt good enough,” Shivers has recently told Laverty. “He was a good footballer. He coached the team and played on the Lavey team for years. He was a PE teacher up in St Colms in Draperstown, took teams and did very well.” Laverty never forgot Shivers. He knew his footballers and, especially, a midfielder when he saw one. Winning captains names will continue to go up on the walls of St Patricks Maghera, but Eugene Laverty will always be the first. From the team on , who set the standard for others to follow. READ ALSO - Match report - Omagh - Maghera - Click here...

The closures will take place with a phased approach from today and over the coming days. The decision comes less than a week after council closed all its buildings to the public and cancelled a number of up and coming public events. Members met again today to get an update on council services and contingency measures being put into place by council to protect its staff and the public and help reduce the risk of COVID- across the Council area. Members heard that while play parks will be closed over the coming days, public parks and cemeteries will continue to remain open. googletag.cmd.push Other essential services such as bin collection services will continue to operate. Recycling centres remain open however some adaptations have been made to limit the number of cars entering sites at the one time in an effort to encourage social distancing. Members also agreed to postpone the Foyle Maritime Festival and the Strabane Summer Jamm both scheduled to take place over the summer months. Earlier this week Clipper Ventures confirmed to Council that the Clipper   Race is postponed. Members also heard that a number of signicant events including the Worker’s Rights and Social Justice Week and the Battle of the Atlantic VE Day commemorations planned for May have also been cancelled. googletag.cmd.push Events scheduled beyond the summer months will remain under review. In line with Government guidelines, many council staff are working from home while others providing front line services continue to report to work where internal working arrangements that include social distancing and additional health and safety measures are being implemented. All of this is being done in full consultation with unions, with a commitment to provide as many essential services as possible. Members were provided reassurance by council officials that adaptations have been made within council services to facilitate the continued delivery of vital services and that any operational changes to any service will be communicated to the public. While some council committee meetings have been postponed, new arrangements have been put in place for a Full Council meeting to take place later this month. Members were of the view that the key decision making process should continue for as long as possible. Members were also informed that while the City of Derry Airport is open and fully operational and council in partnership with the CODA Board is looking at contingency measures to mitigate against the severe and immediate financial impact of COVID- and is engaging with Ministers and officials over the coming days to discuss options for protecting this vital service. Elected members were informed that the council’s Business Support team are currently disseminating the information from Central Government in relation to rates relief and business support and will be available to offer advice and guidance to local business. In relation to community resilience and community support members were informed that Council is currently looking at mechanisms of how it can provide support to the local community sector at this time. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle chaired the meeting and welcomed the update and praised the efforts of Council in making key decisions at this challenging time. She spoke about the dficulties being faced by the local business community sector and made reference to the decision by O’Neill’s in Strabane to close its doors. “This is hugely sad news for Strabane and not an easy decision for Kieran and his team to make but I think it’s the right one and we will hopefully see the business up and running again in the near future.” The Mayor added: “The Council continues to provide strong leadership and is putting the health and safety of its staff and the public to the fore as it responds to this crisis in a responsible and proactive manner. The Council is also being proactive in working with our statutory agencies and partners in terms of contingency planning and service provision.” Providing reassurance to the public, the Mayor said that while Council facilities are closed to the public, essential services will continue for as long as possible and they can contact the Council directly at    or follow Council on Twitter and Facebook and on the Council website atwww.derrystrabane  coronavirusfor regular updates. She encouraged the public to take note of the advice from the Public Health Agency and to watch out for elderly family members, neighbours and friends. She praised the efforts of health workers, shop assistants, bin collectors, delivery men and all those providing the essential services during this dficult and challenging time. “By working together and looking out for one another we can all do our bit to limit the spread of this virus and protect our local community by taking the necessary precautions to stay safe,” she concluded.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

A ten-day trip to South Africa has also been cancelled by the school.Mr Peter Dobbin, principal, told parents that the schoolrsquos primary duty of care was to ldquothe health and safety and to the wellbeing of each and every student and member of staff.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and we are navigating unchartered waters, so please bear with us as we try to ensure that we maintain learning and teaching at this time, said Mr Dobbin.He said that he and his staff were also preparing for ldquoan inevitable school closure in due course and would ensure that no external visitors, including parents, would be allowed past the entrance foyer, unless it was under ldquoexceptional circumstances.He revealed that the school had implemented ldquoenhanced cleaning procedures since the beginning of the month.The school has also cancelled all extra-curricular activities and postponed the Year  and Year  parent teacher meetings, scheduled for next Tuesday.Mr Kevin Lambe, principal of Shimna Integrated College, Newcastle, confirmed on Monday that the schoolrsquos sky trip to Austria had been cancelled.Outlining his schoolrsquos response to the current coronavirus threat level, Mr Lambe said that additional cleaning protocols were in place and that all evening activities involving community groups had been cancelled until further notice.He added: ldquoOur current priority is to put in place arrangements to support studentsrsquo continued learning and revision should schools close..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cemetery.jpg","title":"Cemetery blaze report due out  ","story":"POLITICIANS will be provided with an update on the recent blaze which ripped through part of a building at Struell cemetery in Downpatrick.The blaze mdash which is believed to have been started by an electrical fault ndash has left Newry, Mourne and Down Council with a repair bill running into tens of thousands of pounds.The Fire and Rescue Service carried out a detailed examination of the building in the aftermath of the blaze and members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee are expected to discover its initial findings tomorrow night.Mechanical equipment, including a small digger, was destroyed in the blaze at the Old Course Road cemetery three weeks ago, with firefighters able to prevent flames from spreading to a toilet block which remains operational.The cemetery was temporarily closed by local authority officials in the wake of the fire but was subsequently reopened. Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational. He also hopes that councillors will be provided with an estimate of the cost of the repair work.ldquoThis is Downpatrickrsquos only public cemetery and I hope that once the insurers have completed their assessment and the Fire and Rescue Service report is discussed, that repairs can get underway, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe cemetery is widely used by people from across the district and while the scale of the damage was signicant, it is somewhat comforting that the blaze is being blamed on an electrical fault and was not as the result of an arson attack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cheltenham.jpg","title":"Cheltenham joy  ","story":"THERE was local success at the Cheltenham Festival last week.Ravenhill, bred in Comber by Aaron Metcalfe, won the National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival last Tuesday.The  year-old, ridden by leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd and trained by Gordon Elliott, romped home at  .

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our communities.Other councillors who spoke at Monday nightrsquos debate included Roisin Mulgrew, Michael Savage, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold

Fountain Foodbank has launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic.The cross-community facility mdash which has seen an upsurge in demand over recent days and handed out almost  food parcels last week mdash introduced the new service this week in the wake of Mondayrsquos advice from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that people should avoid all ldquonon essential contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll.

There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Fear and uncertainty is widespread throughout this community,” she said.“There will be a long term impact on the mental and economic health of the citizens of this City and Borough but the measures we have enacted so far are within the scope of our organisation.”Members then heard from the Chief Executive, Roger Wilson who reminded elected representatives of their duties in a time of crisis.“We are Council, we are the form of government closest to its citizens and, as civic leaders, we need to lead our community through this,” he said.“We are not the only people who have a role in this but we need to make sure we are all pulling in the one direction.“Many people are scared and are looking for information. Speaking to many of you, I know that you are being inundated by people looking for help and I would seek members approval to make decisions quickly as things are moving at a very fast pace.“There willbe a big impact on our communities mental well being and health and that is a challenge we will all have to face. We need to accept that and find a way to support our community.”The motion to support Council’s ongoing approach to thecoronavirus situation was proposed by Councillor Paul Berry and seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.Speaking after the motion was passed Sinn Fein’s Catherine Nelson thanked Council staff and officials for their tireless work and implored Council to consider using its cash reserves to help the local community through this crisis.“The rule book goes out the window at a time like this,” she said on behalf of her party.“Big decisions will need to be made and time will be no friend of ours. We give the Chief Executive and senior management team our full support. We have trust and faith in you.“I would ask for an imaginative and exhaustive approach. We don’t have to try and reinvent the wheel but we should be mindful of the mental health of our citizens and think about what we can do to help them.“We should think of walks, the appropriate use of our open spaces, drive in cinemas and even the use of our reserve fund to help those in need.“We talk about saving the reserves for a rainy day, we will never get a rainier day than what we are about to experience.”Her sentiments were echoed by independent Councillor Paul Berry who also urged Council to do what it could to keep businesses informed.“I would request that the information is kept flowing daily,not hourly because the message from businesses is clear, very few of them have more than a very short space of time to go.“Urgent intervention is required as we speak.It is important we try and keep SMEs and large businesses up to date on a daily basis to encourage them to try and hang in there.”The Ulster Unionist Party’s Julie Flaherty also urged Council to unite for the good of the community.“This is a time when we need to come together like never before,” she said.“We need to maximise the community response. We also want to extend our thanks to the Chief Executive and senior officials. You have our full support and we will strive to keep people informed.“The impact of this will be felt in our communityfor a long time and the UUP, along with this council, will be at the forefront of this issue.”The Alliance Party’s Peter Lavery also outlined his party’s support for the Chief Executive and said now is the time to set aside political dferences in order to protect le.“We look forward to hearing how we can help support local businesses,” said Cllr Lavery.“Council will play a strong role in lobbying central government on behalf of our community and we all know this situation will get worse before it gets better.“We must do all we can to support our community.”Democratic Unionist Party colleagues, DarrynCausby and Steven Moutray also extendedtheir appreciation to the Chief Executive, senior management team and all Council staff for their efforts.“Thistsunami is sweeping across the world and it will have a negative effect on our businesses,” said Cllr Moutray.“We need to know what we can do to help them and we, as councillors, will ensure that everyone is made aware of the help on offer.”Cllr Causby commended Cllr Nelson for her suggestion on using Council funds.“I would like to say that the idea of a community fund already mentioned by Catherine Nelson is something we should look at going forward,” he said.“As we move forward in this very dficult environment, we will work as best we can to take the dficult decisionsand provide support to those who need it.”The SDLP’s Thomas O’Hanlon also thanked the Chief Executive and the senior managementteam but warned that bigger decisions would need to be made in the near future.“Our community face very dficult times, they are scared and frightened, just as we all are.None of us are medical experts but it is a civic leaders duty to be calm and measured and ensure we respond with compassion.“We will get through this. Roger, you have made timely decisions so far and you will have more to make but you have our support.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most
