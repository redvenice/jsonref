Photograph: EPAAndy RainA British government minister has accepted that “further dialogue” is required with the Irish government over a controversial US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed changes to immigration laws.During a debate in the House of Lords on Monday prior to a vote, the planned pre-travel clearance checks for those entering Northern Ireland were branded “unworkable”, with members urging the UK Lords Minister, Susan Williams (Baroness Williams of Trafford) to “make concessions”.Responding to criticism about lack of communication with the Irish Government and tourist chiefs, she said: “We do accept the need for further dialogue with interlocuters including the Irish government, Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I totally accept that point.”Last Tuesday, Westminster MPs voted to reinstate the proposal for an electronic waiver following an amendment by the House of Lords to exempt Northern Ireland from the new legislation. The day after the Commons challenge, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said as far as he was concerned, it had not been finalised. He described the decision as “regrettable”.Coming under the British government’s Nationalities and Borders Bill, the proposal will require EU citizens who are not Irish will to apply online for pre-travel clearance -known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into the North.Addressing the Lords on Monday after submitting an amendment, Paul Murphy (Baron Murphy of Torfaen) said he was “hopeful the Minister would have spoken to her colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and would have made some concessions on this”. “But the dead hand of the Home Office is there again,” he added.The former Northern Ireland Secretary of State said he was “troubled” by the introduction of an ETA, at a cost of €14, saying it would severely impact on tourism, cross-border health services and the “spirit of the Good Friday Agreement” .“Is it really worth jeopardising our (BritishIrish) relationship which is bad enough as it is over the last number of years by this petty and silly proposal by the government...I hope the government will change its mind but I’m not hopeful.”The planned change to the law will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.Former SDLP leader Margaret Richie also expressed her opposition, saying the ETA scheme was “unworkable”.“It is unenforceable and would violate the very premise of reconciliation in terms of the Good Friday Agreement,” she told the Lords.She asked the UK minister to “consider the geography” of Border towns and villages, saying: “I believe the Home Office hasn’t fully considered that.” “There’s one village that straddles both Donegal and Fermanagh, that is the small village of Pettigo where that Border goes straight down the middle.“Within one minute you could be in the Republic of Ireland and the next minute, you could be in Northern Ireland.” She queried what discussions had taken with the Irish Government as well tourism organisations.The human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), has also condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.Baroness Williams — who described herself as “an Irish woman with a father from Northern Ireland” — indicated however that the ETA plan was likely to be passed. “Once the EU’s come into force next year, Ireland will stand out as one of the few countries in Europe without an ETA style pass,” she said.Referring to tourism, she said that “once granted, an ETA will be valid for multiple trips to the UK”, and that the cost is “likely to be small and unlikely to be a deterrent for visitors”.“Moreover, many of the UK’s international partners have taken a similar approach to border security...It is a very familiar concept for travellers,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator

Austen has been replaced on a university literature course to help “decolonisation of the curriculum”.The author of Pride and Prejudice has been replaced by Toni Morrison, an writer known for works about the African American experience, as the focus of an English module at Stirling University.Replacing Austen on the English literature programme would help the “decolonisation of the curriculum”, university documents stated ahead of the change.Swapping the Regency author for Morrison would also “contribute to increased ersity” on the syllabus, according to forms informing management of alterations to course material.This material will include markedly different themes compared to those in Austen’s novels, with students told: “The main topics covered will include racial difference and critical race theory, gender and sexuality.”Those taking on the Special Authors module in 2022 will also be taught about “black postmodernism, Gothic, as well as the aesthetics of the contemporary US and African-American novel”.The changes to the course come following a commitment made in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, with Stirling University Principle Prof Gerry McCormac saying the institution must “support an anti-racist agenda in higher education”.The 2020 protests prompted iconoclastic reviews of historical figures from Winston Churchill to Charles Dickens, and Austen was also dragged into the debate about slavery at the Jane Austen House Museum, which reexamined her place in “Regency-era colonialism”.The writer’s personal ties to the slave trade were also brought up, as her father Rev George Austen was at one time the trustee of an Antigua sugar plantation.The English and Literature department at Stirling has not critiqued Austen, and the university has said that its Special Authors module changes focus on an annual basis.Internal documents stated there would be changes to the structure of the course or the outcomes for students, other than improved ersity and “decolonisation”.While this is cited as a benefit in the application to change the module, the issue of decolonisation is also a cause of concern on the English course, with trigger warnings added to the reading list to alert students to “the language of colonialism”.The reading list for one English module states: “Some of the material in the module includes discussion of colonialism (including colonial violence towards men and women), enslavement, violence, racism, sexism and issues surrounding representations of gender, class, race, and mental health.”Historical colonialisms are not the only issue to receive a warning in the list of set texts, and another module warns that some writings deal with issues of “neocolonialism”, adding: “This is challenging material that deals with inequalities and ‘difference’ in erse settings.”Stirling University has said that its rotating Special Authors course “aims to introduce students to a erse range of writers, including international voices and those from British literary history”.Morrison, who died in 2019, was a Nobel prize-winning author known for novels including her debut The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, and Beloved.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow blocking access to Mariupol so it can \u0026#39clean up\u0026#39 war crimes, says Volodymyr ZelenskyFrench election 2022 poll

endured bombardment from British jets and ships as he manned a machine-gun post, perched in a freezing, waterlogged trench, overlooking Port Stanley.When the teenage conscript eventually returned to Argentina, after a brief stint as a prisoner of war, he had frostbitten toes, shrapnel in his knee and was so traumatised, he needed psychological support.Now, 40 years later, González remains convinced of two things – that attempting to take the Falklands by force was a terrible mistake, and that the islands were, are and always will be Argentine.“The Malvinas are one of the few things that unite all Argentines. Maybe the only other one is watching the national football team,” says the 58-year-old.“When I was sent there, it was completely unexpected. But I was filled with pride. I felt fear and a little bit of craziness, but there was no doubt that it was a just cause,” he added.Such views are held across Argentina, where street names reference Las Malvinas, the Castillian name for the remote archipelago, and where neighbourhood walls are adorned with murals depicting the islands in the sky blue and white of the Argentine flag. Along with the late Diego Maradona, the Falklands are also a favourite tattoo for many working-class Argentines.One poll last year found that 81 per cent of Argentines wanted Buenos Aires to continue its efforts to recover the Falklands from the United Kingdom. Equally, Argentines today overwhelmingly agree that the campaign should be pursued exclusively through peaceful, diplomatic channels.Carlos Ruckauf, a former vice president and foreign minister, compares the UK’s acquisition of the Falklands to Russia’s seizure of rebel enclaves in eastern Ukraine. “For Argentines, Luhansk and Donetsk remind us of the Malvinas,” he says.That belief is rooted in geography – with the islands located on a continental shelf 300 miles from Argentine Patagonia but 8,000 miles from the UK – and history. The Falklands were first discovered, uninhabited, by a British expedition in 1690. They subsequently passed through British, French, US and Spanish hands, with Madrid controlling the islands when Argentina declared its independence in 1816. The UK then occupied them in 1833, expelling a Hamburg-born trader who Buenos Aires had charged with exploiting the islands’ resources.The history resonates so much, says Carlos De Angelis, a sociologist at the University of Buenos Aires, because Argentina’s borders have remained relatively unchanged since independence. British sovereignty of the Falklands is perhaps the most significant perceived foreign intervention during the nation’s 200-year history.That context is something all Argentines are taught at school and is often repeated by politicians, especially the former president and current vice president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, of the Peronist party. In a typically symbolic move, Peronist politicians last month proposed renaming Rivadavia Avenue, one of Buenos Aires’ principal thoroughfares, “Argentine Malvinas Avenue”. They claimed the move was a tribute to the 649 Argentine servicemen who died during the Falklands conflict and even greater number of veterans who subsequently took their own lives.On the anniversary itself on Saturday, president Alberto Fernández led a ceremony with veterans and families of the fallen at the recently-opened Museum of the Malvinas in the Argentine capital. “The Malvinas are Argentine and also Latin American,” he said.The Falklands can also be used in Argentina to attack rivals. Last year, the opposition politician Patricia Bullrich, who had been a minister during the 2015-2019 centre-Right presidency of Mauricio Macri, which had downplayed the Falklands claim, made the mistake of joking about the islands, suggesting Buenos Aires use them to secure Pfizer Covid vaccines. She was forced to apologise after national uproar.“In school, they place a lot of emphasis on 1833. It’s a watershed. The islands are a feeling, an idea that unites all Argentines,” says Juan Bautista, 24, an international relations student at the Catholic University of Córdoba.He also draws parallels between Putin’s aggression against Ukraine and the decision by Galtieri’s military dictatorship to invade the Falklands in 1982: “In both cases, an authoritarian government sought to revindicate itself through a nationalist military adventure.”Yet Argentine curriculums do encourage independent thinking, says Gabriel Luna, 21, a film student at Buenos Aires’ National Arts University, who is more indifferent about the Falklands. “I just don’t like nationalism, or shouting your beliefs in other people’s faces,” says Luna. “Nationalism is harmful.”The Falklands war had profound consequences for Argentina – most obviously in hastening the fall of the junta.The dictatorship was already in serious difficulties when it launched the invasion, having presided over an economic collapse – including a 10-fold devaluation of its currency – and under increasing international pressure for its brutal, paranoid suppression of dissent, “disappearing” thousands of real and perceived political opponents. Just days before Argentine troops’ amphibious assault on the Falklands, an estimated 30,000 demonstrators gathered in Buenos Aires to protest – at the time, an unprecedented show of bravery against the dictatorship.The national mood was turned, briefly, on its head by the grab of the Falklands. Two days after Argentina had seized the islands, some 100,000 cheering, flag-waving citizens crowded into the Plaza de Mayo, the square that had previously become the venue of the lonely protests of the mothers of the disappeared.The euphoria was not to last. As swiftly as the British Armed Forces proved their superiority over their Argentine counterparts, the mood in the country turned to fury against a military government that had even proven incompetent at what was, supposedly, its speciality, namely fighting wars.“The invasion was like the grasping of a dying man,” says Dr De Angelis. “But it backfired completely. These generals and admirals were seen as not even able to organise a military campaign, as opposed to dealing with unarmed Argentine civilians.Veterans of the war were also treated as a national embarrassment. Mr González, who eventually forged an eclectic career working the lights in a theatre, as a security guard and teacher, recalls how prospective employers would see the stamp denoting that he was a veteran on his national identity card and then decline to hire him.“Employers didn’t want veterans. They thought we were trouble, difficult. They never said that to your face, but you knew,” he says. Four decades on, his life remains marked by that brutal month he spent on the Falklands, including occasional stabbing pains in his toes.“For me, it was a war between two governments, not against the British people. It’s clear the junta were criminals. They did unforgivable things – kidnap, torture, murder.“I think the British are a civilised people, with their mistakes, of course, like any other people. When I was captured, I was treated in a gentlemanly way. But I still believe in the Malvinas, and I don’t have any doubt that sooner or later, they will be Argentine.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow blocking access to Mariupol so it can \u0026#39clean up\u0026#39 war crimes, says Volodymyr ZelenskyFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Drivers face costliest Easter getaway ever as fuel prices hit record highsNo-fault orces won’t end torture of splitting money, says Baroness ShackletonCouncil staff earning more than £100,000 hits highest level in a decadeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rishi sunak donates 100000 old boarding school winchester college","story":"Rishi Sunak and his wife have donated more than £100,000 to  Winchester College, his old boarding school, it has emerged.The Chancellor was a head boy at the school, which charges £43,335 per year, before going on to study PPE at Oxford University.He and his wife, Akshata Murthy, are listed in the latest copy of the college magazine as “Wykeham benefactors”, meaning they have made donations in excess of £100,000.A spokesman for Mr Sunak said that the money would be used to fund scholarships for underprivileged children to attend the school.“Rishi and his wife have donated to numerous charities and philanthropic causes for many years and will continue to do so,” they said.“These donations are made to help fund scholarships for children who would not otherwise have the opportunity to go to Winchester.”Mr Sunak is believed to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament thanks to his past career as a banker and marriage to Ms Murthy, who is the co-founder of Indian tech giant Infosys.Some reports have suggested that he has a net worth of around £200 million.He has previously said that his time at the college “helped make me who I am as a person”.Despite insistence that the money donated to Winchester College would be used to pay for poorer students to attend, he was accused by Labour of paying money to his “old boys network”, rather than giving money to state schools.“Rishi Sunak has already said that he is ‘maxed out’ on how much support he can give to our state schools, but he continues to hand out billions in taxpayer subsidies to elitist private schools,” said Bridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow education secretary.“Labour would end the tax giveaway Rishi Sunak hands out to his old boys\u0027 network and use the money to improve every state school instead, ensuring everyone leaves education ready for work and ready for life.”Mr Sunak was asked about his millionaire background at the Conservative Party Spring Conference in Blackpool late last month, amid the cost of living crisis for many households in the UK.“I\u0027m sitting here in this job, as the product of a lot of sacrifice, and a lot of kindness from lots of people in my life,” he said.“They thought that would be for us the springboard for creating a better life for us.”He added that he understood that not everyone has the same opportunities in life, and that he had been “fortunate”, but would work “day and night” to spread those opportunities to families in the UK.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow blocking access to Mariupol so it can \u0026#39clean up\u0026#39 war crimes, says Volodymyr ZelenskyFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Drivers face costliest Easter getaway ever as fuel prices hit record highsNo-fault orces won’t end torture of splitting money, says Baroness ShackletonCouncil staff earning more than £100,000 hits highest level in a decadeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"un impotent face horror","story":"It has never been so easy to gather evidence of war crimes. Satellite images now achieve such a level of detail that they can show inidual bodies on the streets. Smartphones have been used by the Ukrainians to capture photographs of atrocities and publish them online. Investigators will have no shortage of material to prove that Vladimir Putin’s forces are guilty of murder, rape, and the brutalisation of the Ukrainian population and that the Kremlin’s denials are mendacious.None of this is likely to make it any easier to hold Putin and his regime to account internationally, however, in part because Russia retains a veto as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, addressed the UN yesterday, saying this gave Russia the right to sow death. The massacres in towns such as Bucha have only highlighted how toothless the body has become.When the UN was set up in 1945, the hope was that it would avoid the deficiencies that plagued its predecessor, the League of Nations, which was powerless to stop the slide into the Second World War. To be fair to the UN, there has not been another major global conflict since it was founded – although that might have rather more to do with the proliferation of nuclear weapons than any high-minded discussions in New York.Aside from the embarrassing tendency for the most brutal regimes in the world to acquire seats on UN human rights bodies, at the heart of the problem is the Security Council. Populated by the victors of the Second World War, the UK and France retain a leading role, while larger economies such as Japan have no permanent seat. The presence of China and Russia, meanwhile, means that two nations that have long been guilty of terrible breaches of international norms can block moves to discipline them.There does not seem to be much appetite for reform, although countries such as India and Nigeria occasionally complain about the lack of influence accorded to rising powers. It is also not clear what sorts of reform would be beneficial, given the obvious risk that enlarging the central decision-making body would make it even harder for decisions to be made.Perhaps the rot at the heart of the UN mattered less in a world where the United States was still the global hegemon, or even when the US and USSR were locked in a cold war.

Apprenticeships in the Red Wall have dropped by a third since , and fallen in all but two Northern constituencies, according to the think-tank Onward. In the same period, wealthy parts of London including Battersea, Wimbledon, Cha and Fulham have seen the greatest increases in the number of people doing apprenticeships. Also the number of entry-level apprenticeshipshas fallen by more than halfin just over a decade, the think-tank revealed. Boris Johnson vowed to offer every young person in Britain a guaranteed apprenticeship, weeks into the first lockdown. The Prime Minister warned it was “inevitable” that there would be “many, many job losses” in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Senior Tory MP Tom Tugenhadt told the Mirror apprenticeships are “fundamental to levelling-up and fundamental to transforming the way we look at education in the United Kingdom”. He expressed concern that many young people’s “le chances will be affected in the lead up to the next election”more apprenticeships aren’t offered. Will Tanner, Director of Onward and former Deputy Head of Policy to Theresa May, said: “Apprenticeships are not delivering and without far-reaching reform will work against ministers’ ambitions to level up the country.Working class school leavers in poorer places need a decent alternative to university, not a system that increasingly serves existing workers in big businesses based in cities.

Speculation has been mounting that Boris Johnson could ditch the fracking ban as he draws up plans to wean the UK off reliance on Russian oil and gas.The long-trailed energy security strategy is expected to be published on Thursday after several delays. Fracking involves extracting gas from rocks and breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. A moratorium was imposed on the controversial process in November  after experts said it was not possible to accurately predict the probability or magnitude of earthquakes linked to the process. The Tory manesto in  promised: “We will not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.”Announcing the review, MrKwarteng said: “It remains the case that fracking in England would take years of exploration and development before commercial quantities of gas could be produced for the market, and would certainly have no effect on prices in the near term.“However, there will continue to be an ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades as we transition to cheap renewable energy and new nuclear power.In light of Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources.“However, unless the latest scientic evidence demonstrates that shale gas extraction is safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby, the pause in England will remain in place.” He asked for the report to be submitted before the end of June. Friends of the Earth energy campaigner, Danny Gross, said the idea that fracking could help to lower bills was pure fantasy.“We don’t need a review to know that fracking is not the answer to our energy needs, he said. The idea that shale gas extraction will signicantly lower energy bills or improve energy security is pure fantasy.“Fracking has been deeply unpopular with communities that have faced the prospect of shale gas extraction.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

But many believe the Conservatives are taking revenge on the Channel for its coverage of Brexit and willingness to hold Boris Johnson ’s government to account.So far over , people have signed a petition calling for the sale to be halted, and many of the channel’s stars have also spoken out against the “cultural vandalism”.So why is the Government selling Channel , and what will be the consequences for viewers  Why is the Government privatising Channel   Channel  was launched in  by the Thatcher government to encourage more independent television production. The not-for-profit broadcaster receives no public money and is funded by advertising. On becoming Culture Secretary, Dorries had to be corrected when she wrongly claimed the channel received public money. Announcing the sell-off she said government ownership is “holding Channel  back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon”. She added the proceeds from the sale – which could be as much as £billion – would go into “levelling-up the creative sector, putting money into independent production and creative skills in priority parts of the country”.  What do the Government’s critics say  Broadcasting experts say the sale makes no sense. They fear the channel will be bought by another media giant, possibly based overseas, which will want to make its own programmes rather than commission from independent programmes. There will also be less money for programming as money will be syphoned off to pay executives and shareholders. Who  has spoken out  TV stars have lined up to criticise the sale. The Thick of It and Veep creator Armando Iannucci accused the government of ignoring the results of a consultation, tweeting: “They asked for ‘a debate’ % of submissions in that debate said it was a bad idea. But still they go ahead. Why do they want to make the UK’s great TV industry worse  It makes no business, economic or even patriotic sense.” Matt Lucas, co-presenter of Channel ’s biggest show The Great British Bake Off, was one of thousands to sign the petition demanding the privatisation process stops. He said: “C is owned by the public, is self-funding and costs you nothing. All profits are funnelled straight back into programming. “Wrong decision by the government.” Kirstie Allsop said: “No true Conservative would sell Channel , Lady T will be spinning in her grave. “C was set up to foster the British film and TV industry and it has done that job admirably. Any Tory MP who votes for this is a traitor to their party and country.”  Is there another reason for the sell off  Tory MP Julian Knight, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, suggested the sell-off was revenge for the channel’s coverage of Brexit. He said: “Is this being done for revenge for Channel ’s biased coverage of the likes of Brexit and personal attacks on the Prime Minister  The timing of the announcement at pm, coinciding with Channel  news, was very telling.”Some see it as a wider attack on public service broadcasting. Dorries has already warned the BBC licence fee could be scrapped by . Others fear the Government wants to silence Channel ’s critical news coverage and reporting, which it views as part of the “woke agenda”.The channel has not been afraid to hold the Government to account. During the  election, for example, it replaced Boris Johnson with a lump of melting ice when he refused to take part in a debate on the climate crisis. It prompted the Tories to threaten a review of the Channel’s licence – a threat they have now carried out.  What dference will it make to viewers  Under a new owner many of Channel ’s favourite programmes, such as Gogglebox and Bake Off, may not be recommissioned. There will also be a question mark over its cutting-edge drama output. Channel  commissioned It’s A Sin, which has garnered  Bafta nominations, after it was rejected by multiple TV stations. Private ownership could mean less money for programming as any profits would go to the owner and its shareholders. A lot depends on the terms of the sale. If the Government fails to enshrine in law the channel’s editorial independence it could mean Channel  News is replaced with a news programme that promotes a pro-government agenda. Will it definitely happen  Not necessarily. Dozens of Tories have spoken out against the plans. The Government could be hit with a backbench revolt when it brings forward legislation to authorise the sale.Among those to criticise the move are former Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said: “I am not in favour of it because I think as it stands Channel  provides competition to the BBC on what’s called public service broadcasting, the kinds of programmes that are not commercially viable, and I think it would be a shame to lose that.”Tom Tugendhat, Tory chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told Times Radio: “Given the success Channel  has been in promoting independent production around the UK, I remain to be convinced this is going to achieve the aim the government has set out. I’ll be listening but I’m pretty doubtful.”Damian Green MP, Theresa May ’s former deputy, tweeted: “The sale of Channel  is politicians and civil servants thinking they know more about how to run a business than the people who run it. Very un-Conservative. Mrs Thatcher, who created it, never made that mistake.”Former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson branded the idea “the opposite of levelling up”.

When the results came back, I was shocked by what they said. Growing up, Louisaaposs blonde hair and blue eyes had always stood out in family photos, in which she was surrounded by siblings with dark features. Still, despite her burning desire to know more, she did not ask her parents about her origins until she turned . Louisaaposs dad would not discuss the adoption, but her mum revealed that she had been adopted in England while they were working there. She said: “My father was a heart specialist at a hospital and my mother was desperate to have more kids. They already had two children and my mum was pregnant with my sister, but she’d had a string of miscarriages and wasn’t sureshe would carry to full term.  “So, they adopted me and, after my mum gave birth to my younger sister, they brought the five of us kids back to Australia. “I told my mum that I wanted to find my birth family and she warned me to be careful, as my birth mother may not want to be found.” Armed with just a birth certicate, which revealed her birth mother’s name as Gayle, she discovered that her birth mum was a French Canadian woman living in England when she gave birth. And so the long search for answers began. Louisa said: “By then, I had children of my own, which made the search seem far more important. But I still only managed to confirm the few details I already had. “A friend of mine who had a big interest in family history was able to use my mother’s name to search shipping records and confirmed that she had travelled to the UK before my birth. I discovered this back in the late s, but I’ve since had those same records come up on Ancestry. “I was born in West Londonaposs Hammersmith Hospital and my adoptive father trained there for several years. This new record had my birth mother listed as a medical photographer, which led some people to assume she worked there and could have possibly met my father there, but that didn’t lead anywhere. “I spent years trying to trace my birth family with no luck and it was only when social media came about that I had any real place to start.” During this time, Louisa met and married her husband Jonny and the pair set up home in Antigua in the Caribbean, raising a family of their own.  She said: “I would still wonder a lot about my heritage and family history. It felt like a piece of who I am was missing. “Part of me always wonderedmy adoptive dad was my real father, especially when I thought he had worked with my birth mother. “Then both my adoptive parents passed away in , just  weeks apart. At a dead end in her search, Louisa tried to move on with her le, only renewing her efforts in  with her all-important Ancestry DNA test which, to her surprise, revealed links with Lithuania, where she was matched with distant relatives.She said: “I started talking to distant cousins in Lithuania that I never knew I had and, within two weeks, they pointed me to a Facebook page of a man in Michigan, USA, whose father had dated my birth mother in  and had no idea I existed.“His father was obviously very shocked to learn about me, but it was amazing to be able to make a small connection. It gave me a window into my family that I’d never had before and he was able to tell me more about the time he spent with my mother. I also found another DNA match who turned out to be my mother’s cousin, who had been raised with her in Canada. “My mother had passed away five years prior, but neither her cousin nor the children she’d had later had any idea about me.” Spurred on by the sudden influx of new relatives, Louisa decided to meet them face-to-face.She said: “My husband and I were supposed to go to a wedding in the UK in June , but instead decided on a road trip to visit my family in Toronto, Canada. “There I discovered my mother had confided in a few friends that she had met my father while on holiday in Europe. She discovered she was pregnant in the UK and what was meant to be a two-to-three-month holiday ended up being a year in the country as she was pregnant with me. Before heading back home from her trip in , Louisa made a pitstop in Michigan to finally meet her birth father, half-brother and half-sister. She said: “It was very emotional. As soon as I clapped eyes on him, I could see the resemblance to my son. Little facial features and characteristics that I never would have known were my father’s before this. “All the family I have met have been so welcoming and loving. “In recent months, my family in Canada have been looking through boxes of old photos my mother had kept and they actually found a couple of photos of my birth parents together. “One of them, at a dance, I believe may have been taken the night I was conceived. “They were both working at a summer camp together and had a fling. My father left the country when the season ended with no idea that my mother was pregnant. “Still not much is known about the following year that my mother spent in England, but she put me up for adoption before ing to Canada.” Now, Louisa is focussing on building relationships with her newfound siblings.  She said: “I’ve already had a girls’ weekend in New York, USA, with my sisters on my mother’s side and we are constantly in touch on a WhatsApp group.“My brother on my dad’s side of the family even came to visit us in Antigua on his honeymoon, so we definitely have an ongoing family connection. “When my birth mother died, they had her ashes put into pendants for necklaces. An extra one was made and no one ever knew why, but when I found my sisters, they gave the spare one to me so, even though I never got to meet my mother, I now carry part of her with me wherever I go. “It made me cry when they gave it to me. I was very emotional. I had always wanted to find my mother and was so sad to hear that she had passed away before I could see her.

Locals have stopped swimming in the Wye after it turned greenThe River Wye has been described as an open sewer Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  Apr |comments One of Britain’s most loved rivers has been described as an “open sewer” as vast amounts of manure pollute the once-pristine waters.The River Wye, straddling the border of England and Wales, is a special area of conservation but is suffering from its location at the centre of intensive poultry production, involving over  million birds at any time. We hear a lot about water companies’ overflows of human sewage, but animal muck is causing a bigger problem, especially in rivers in the west of the country.The Prime Minister recently told the Commons of a “memorable dip” he once took in the then-sparkling clean Wye, which he said was “like tasting nectar”.But now the river is turning into a poultry potty as manure from the birds is spread on the land as fertiliser at such high levels that when it rains it is washed off into tributaries.  Locals have stopped swimming in the Wye after it turned green, with the appearance of pea soup, from dense algal blooms caused by phosphates. Chicken manure contains higher levels of phosphates than other types. This bloom sucks up all the oxygen from rivers, suffocating fish and depriving species such as otters and kingfishers of their food. Swimming and kayaking teacher Angela Jones, , has swum in the Wye for  years but says it has become an “open sewer”. She says % of water crowfoot, which swans rely on, has gone. Poultry numbers in the area have doubled since , making it the free-range egg capital of Europe. Rachel Sharp, chief of Wildle Trusts Wales, warns the Wye is dying. She says: “The problem is too many chickens in one catchment, with statutory agencies not monitoring sufficiently and lack of any action. We are seeking to restore % of land and sea by , and restoring rivers will be a critical element of this.” Experts say there are only two years left to save the Wye. A group of  citizen science campaigners have gathered more than , samples from the river, which they have sent for testing in laboratories at Cardf University.  Manure is the Wye’s main source of pollution, according to a recent study by Lancaster University. A report by the House of Commons environmental audit committee last month noted evidence that  new intensive poultry developments had been granted permission in Powys in the past five years, and many more in Herefordshire. The Ithon, a tributary of the Wye in mid-Wales, contains phosphate levels up to  times higher than in a healthy upland river, according to an analysis commissioned by Fish Legal. The legal outfit, which represents angling groups, has begun a legal challenge after Powys County Council granted planning permission last month for a doubling in size of an industrial chicken unit near Builth Wells in the River Wye catchment, to , birds. Salmon numbers on the river have collapsed from peaks of over , in the s and s. In , only  were caught. Every river in England fails quality tests for pollution, the Environment Agency said last year, with just % reaching a “good ecological standard”.  The cause has the support of singer Feargal Sharkey, a keen fly fisher. The former Undertones lead singer said: “The biggest polluter in this country is agriculture and the industrialisation of food production, meat production, chickens, because all of that fertiliser.” The Environment Agency said: “We’re working closely with stakeholders to tackle the damaging sources of pollution in the River Wye from farming, water industry and home discharges, and run-off from roads and urban areas.” Aa Foods, which owns some local chicken units, said: “We’ve committed to play our part in tackling the issues but we are not a direct contributor: run-off from poultry farms in our supply chain is close to zero, and Aa Foods does not spread manure on land.”  Noble Foods, which makes Happy Eggs, said: “Although we represent a small, single-digit percentage of the poultry flock in the Wye  Usk area, we take our responsibility very seriously and have been working on thorough risk assessments, education, and action plans for the small number of producer owned farms we have in the region.” The National Farmers’ Union Cymru said evidence “does not support the hypothesis that poultry units are the main, or even a particularly important, reason for nutrient failures”. It added: “There are a range of factors that influence water quality in Wales. The Welsh agricultural industry is committed to making improvements in water quality where shown to be needed.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Feargal SharkeyAngela JonesEnvironment AgencyHouse of CommonsLancaster UniversityCardf UniversityPublic servicesPoliticsDaily MirrorEnvironment\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Alex Mahon, Channel  ’s chief executive, wrote: “We have been informed in the last hour that the government will shortly announce that the secretary of state has decided to proceed with the proposal to privatise Channel .The move has been met with widespread concern, with well-known stars flocking to give their verdict on the events.The decision to sell the organisation, first formed in , is the largest example of privatisation since the Post Office was flogged  years ago. The Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, said that government ownership was holding Channel  back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.“A change of ownership will give Channel  the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future,” she insisted. The move was described by shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell as “cultural vandalism”. What does the sell-off mean for Channel    Labour has stressed that the privatisation of Channel  could cause a “great deal of damage”. Ms Powell expressed concern over where the ownership of the broadcaster could end up. She said: “I fear that … rather than competing with some of the big US streaming giants, it is more likely to be bought by one of them. That will take money out of the UK economy, out of the creative industries and the independent sector that has so thrived under Channel . Conservative MP Julian Knight tweeted that he believed the move would give Channel  more independence and space to compete. He said: “It is certainly true that Channel  will have greater freedom to compete once privatised andmanaged well it should be able to continue to innovate and crucially appeal to young audiences - a real usp in today’s broadcast landscape.” The public broadcaster is already funded by adverts, and so it is unlikely that this will change as it does not currently receive money from the government or the licence fee. There are widespread concerns the move will harm independent production companies with close links to the provider. It is thought as many as  could be at risk of closing. In the past, the organisation has never been tasked with making money, with profit being put back into the creation of its content. According to the , analysts have claimed that the sale could see a % to % cut to its £m programming budget in an effort to get the brand into a more commercially focused position. This means that shows and content that donapost make much money are likely to face the chop. What does Channel  and its stars say about the sell-off   Channel  itself doesn’t appear to be best pleased with the news. A spokesperson said: With over , submissions to the government’s public consultation, it is disappointing that today’s announcement has been made without formally recognising the signicant public interest concerns which have been raised. In his email, Mahon set out that the organisation had been pleased with its work over the past  years and had hoped to have seen this continue in the same way over the next . The broadcaster has laid out plans to the government about how it could continue to thrive under government ownership and was maintaining optimism that the sale wasnapost yet a done deal. In a tweet, Location, Location, Location star Kirstie Allsopp said: “This is a load of utter twaddle! No true Conservative would sell Channel , Lady T will be spinning in her grave. C was set up to foster the British film  TV industry and it has done that job admirably. Any Tory MP who votes for this is a traitor to their party  country.”Sir David Attenborough suggested the move formed part of “shortsighted political and financial attacks” while Invictus Games medalist and Strictly Come Dancing star JJ Chalmers said: Genuinely, a piece of my heart just broke. @Channel is remarkable… and important… and… the list is [too] long.The fact that those who hold [its] fate in their hands don’t see [its] true value… is the saddest part. When will the Channel  sale happen   The actual move to privatise may take a little while, provided it can get through parliament. The proposal is due to be added to a draft Media Bill, which will then be included in the Queen’s Speech in May. The bill will need to get through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords before Channel  can be sold. Overall, the process could take as long as  months. In his email, Mahon said: There will now be a long process ahead – it could take  months or more for the required legislation to go through the House of Commons and then Lords. During that time, we’ll continue to work with DCMS and government, and with our supporters across the industry to make the arguments to ensure that Channel  can continue to deliver its remit. What other implications could there be from Channel aposs privatisation   Ms Powell stressed that the sale would be likely to harm people outside of London the most. She said: “I think it will cause a great deal of damage to jobs and opportunities in the creative industries, especially in Leeds and Bristol, and Manchester, and outside of London.”It has been noted that the money the government makes out of the sale would likely be spent on creative and independent production companies, which would in effect be putting money directly into its funding pot for the levelling up agenda.Dorries described the move as a “creative idend for all” as she claims the money would be put back into the creative sector. Who could buy Channel   At the time of writing, it seems the organisation most likely to purchase Channel  would be US-based Discovery, which is joining forces with WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN and HBO. Channel  faced privatisation in , receiving interest from Discovery at the time. The broadcaster has been valued at £ billion.

Matt Shaw, , gave up his job as a financial analyst and turned down a position with a £, salary in London, claiming I donapost know how long I have with them.The dad of two with his we, Tracy, , have already watched their first daughter, Sophia, , beat a brain tumour against all odds. But the couple, from Country Durham, were dealt a devastating double blow when the cancer ed in Sophiaaposs spine and then their second child, Delilah, was born with hyperinsulinism.The condition means that Delilah, three months, has higher than normal insulin levels in her blood and has to be fed every three hours or she could become fatally weak.Hyperinsulinism is estimated to effect around one in , babies in the UK, but Matt claims doctors have told him the chances of these two illnesses hitting his daughters at the same time are billions to one.He told The Mirror : I asked the doctor what are the chances of this happening, you know the cancer coming back but in a dferent part of Sophiaaposs body and then Delilah being diagnosed with this condition.He shook his head and said apositaposs billions to oneapos, he said aposI canapost put a number on itapos, one of these things happening is rare enough in itself. The whole thing has been absolutely exhausting and devastating but Iaposve told myself that Iaposm done being sad, I have to try and stay positive for the girls and believe that we will get through this. Before this I was flying high in my career and during the pandemic I was offered a job down in London which would have paid around £, but I just couldnapost take it. The one positive of this whole process is that it has taught me how precious time is with my family, and being brutally honest I donapost know how much time I have left with them.. You canapost put a price on the memories you make with your children.The family have been plagued by hospital visits since theirfrom a camping trip in Wales in August , when Sophia started complaining of a headache. The couple initially thought the youngster had fallen from her camping bed during the trip but only weeks later, scans revealed a tumour the size of a golf ball in the totaposs cerebellum. Sophia, then just three years old, underwent a successful operation to have the tumour removed and the family were feeling positive again when her scans ed clear in September . But just four weeks after the good news, doctors called Sophia back claiming that they had spotted something suspicious on her spine. The cancer had ed and the family were given the heartbreaking news that it was incurable and only a matter of time.Refusing to accept this the couple launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for a iety of treatments to attack the cancer head on. Matt added: We want to try and keep le as normal as possible for Sophia so we donapost let on too much about what is happening and we have to be brave ourselves. The doctors say that there is nothing they can do for Sophia this time but we refuse to accept that the cancer will win this battle. The pair claim they have already had success with holistic bio-resonance therapy which uses electromagnetic waves to manipulate cells and high doses of Vitamin C which Sophia receives intravenously every week. But the family need £, to sustain this and fly to Spain or Holland to undergo dendritic cell therapy which mimics the bodyaposs own immune system by releasing cells into the body trained to attack the cancer cells. Matt said: The thought of living in this world without either of my little girls is just not an option. We will do everything in our power to see both of them grow up and start families of their own.To donate click hereRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsImmune systemTherapyVitaminsCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And such a criminal was his vile mother Tracey Connelly, one of three people involved in the little boy’s tragic end.Connelly was allowed out on licence once, but she misbehaved and was ed to jail. The Parole Board ruled she should be let out again, to public outrage. Dominic Raab responded to that outcry by opposing Connelly’s release. So far so predictable.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  Now the Sunday Mirror has learned that it was an official in Mr Raab’s own department who approved the Parole Board’s action. Mr Raab did not tell MPs that when he stood up in the House of Commons to denounce it. We now smell not just a whf of hypocrisy but an overpowering stench of it. And as so often with the Tories, they talk tough on crime, only to go weak on the causes of it. Just look at the mess they have made of the Met. Sources close to the Justice Secretary say he was not aware of what his official had done until just before he was due to speak in the Commons. That does not wash. As Secretary of State, the buck stops with him. Honour brave Tom  Amani The Wanted singer Tom Parker was upbeat and courageous to the last. He bonded with law graduate Amani Liaquat as they both battled terminal brain tumours. Amani was frightened she was dying. Tom kept assuring her she was not. Tragically, they both died – Armani in February and Tom last week.  But during that last year of Amani’s le, it was Tom who brought her the joy of true friendship. And when she died, Tom suffered the loss of a true friend too. Amani’s family have the comfort of knowing what a dference Tom made to her final days. The disease that killed them both was an aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multorme. Tumours like it kill more children and adults than any other cancer, yet only % of research money is allocated to finding a cure. The best legacy Amani and Tom could wish for is for the Government to agree to provide much more financial support.Darwin a loser We tracked down canoe fraudster John Darwin to the Philippines, where his we told us he will make nothing from a new TV drama about his extraordinary fraud. Darwin played dead for five years in a £, le insurance swindle after pretending to have perished in a canoe accident. He may think he is getting a raw deal by being denied money for his oar-deal.

Later in the period it will be unsettled across central and southern areas with spells of rain and showers throughout, some locally wintry particularly on higher ground.Likely drier further north, with some isolated wintry showers becoming more unsettled here towards the end of the period.  Windy at times in southern and western regions. Likely to be cold at first with temperatures soon ing to normal in the south and more widely later.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health has set out how to tell the dference between the two viruses to reduce the chance of spreading the infection to others, Belfast Live reports. Signs of coronavirus may not be limited to the three original symptoms commonly described and could include a runny nose, sore throat or headache - all typical signs of a respiratory virus. People experiencing a headache or runny nose have now been advised to stay home despite a negative test, new government guidance warns.They said: Current official advice on COVID-, as detailed on, already acknowledges that symptoms may y and may not be limited to the three central symptoms identied at the outset of the pandemic.COVID- symptoms “may be similar to the cold or flu” and “may y for dferent age groups or dferent iants of the virus”.People with one of the three original symptoms of COVIDare still advised to stay at home and book a PCR test. If you have other symptoms of a respiratory virusyou can take a LFD test.

His only real problem is that he is consistent at making bad choices, and perhaps in time the worst of all will be when he decidednotto relinquish his motheraposs hand at the Westminster Abbey memorial for his father, to let her be led to her seat by someone  as he quietly slipped into his own.Instead Andrew kept her hand, eyeballed the Dean of Westminster into backing down, and flaunted the Head of the Church of England in front of a bank of TV cameras in the full knowledge that his fatheraposs memorial would be reduced to a news item re-upping allegations of sexual abuse.Worse than the public criticism, though, was the well-briefed fury of Charles and William, the next two monarchs who will not be as forgiving as the current one. And then the entirely-coincidental revelation that Andrew had not mended his ways, and had become embroiled with another scandal.This time itaposs a court case in which he, his ex-we and both his daughters are alleged to have been the beneficiaries of a grand swindle. A Turkish banker allegedly persuaded a Turkish millionairess to trust her cash to him, and she has told the court that he used the money to buy influence for himself with the Royals.The Turkish banker was applauded at the princeaposs now-defunct Pitch@Palace initiative, and around the same time Andrew received £.m, his ex-we £,, and his daughter Eugenie a further £,.The millionairess says she was told the money was for a passport. Coutts says they were told it was to pay for Beatriceaposs wedding. This is despite the fact a passport costs £., and Beatrice married a millionaire.  Andrew has now repaid the £,, but a further £, is unaccounted for. The Duchess of York has refused toher chunk, on the grounds it was paid for her work as a brand ambassador for a green energy company, even though it does not seem to be benefitting much from the connection. Beatriceaposs friends have described her as completely unaware of how her wedding was paid for, while Eugenie has let it be known she spent the £, on a surprise birthday party for her mother.And the question must now be asked of the entire family: what is it about dodgy money that attracts you Becausea £, bill for a wedding was settled by a Turkish political exile, any other bride would know about it. If any other woman got six-figure sums from her ex-husbandaposs chums she might wonder why. Andany one of us wanted to throw a surprise party and found it cost the same as a new car, weaposd throw a smaller onewe didnapost have the means to pay for it. Now the Royal Family finds itself in the unenviable situation of having paid £.million between them to make a scandal go away, just as the Duke of York manages to drive them smack into a new one - one which makes them look entitled, opportunistic, and desperate for cash to supplement a lestyle they cannot afford.At a time when the rest of the nation knows to the nearest penny what they can afford, and are turning off the heating or adjusting their shopping habits to scrape by, the fact that the future Royal Family canapost imagine a wedding that costs less than three quarters of a million pounds is not going to improve its long-term chances of survival.The timing of this court case, which has rumbled on for a couple of years, suddenly being made public in the week after Andrew embarrassed his relatives is interesting. And it may be linked to the fact that the Duke, who just a few months ago confirmed his public appearance at the memorial would be the last, is now reportedly considering smearing his pudgy chops across the Derby, a Falklands anniversary event, and the Platinum Jubilee. Why would a man who vowed to step away from the spotlight now be so intent on hogging it  Read more Prince Andrew is a true pauper prince - a man of poor wit, poor talent, and poor judgement. All that makes him rich is his title, and after giving up every other honoric his HRH is the one thing he has held onto. He is not allowed to use it, but he does still have it.He also held on to his daughtersapos titles, when other siblings relinquished them in favour of a more normal le. He fought for his daughtersapos Royal security, when it was costing £m a year and creating bad news as Met police officers were forced to trail after two girls on their gap yahs. For all the criticism levelled at Harry and Meghan for trying to trade off their Royal titles, Andrew and Sarah of York have done exactly that for decades, and with far more disastrous consequences. It perhaps explains why sheaposs still Sarah of York. Whoaposd want to change their name,it would cost you the chance to earn £, without having to go down the pit  Having lost his reputation, his ski chalet, millions of pounds and the trust of most of his wider family, Andrew seems to be intent on reinventing himself - not as a changed or chastened man, but as a prince, who needs to show no humility or shame. With the Queen by his side, Andrew can try it. But he has underestimated two things. The first is the fury of the British public, which does not forgive sexual misconduct in public le that easily, still less so when it involves someone legally a child. And the second is the ruthlessness of monarchy - the one quality which has been passed through that family since William the Conqueror. Charles may go easy on his younger brother, but William seems to feel nothing but scorn for playboy princes with dubious means of financial support. There will not be space on William Vaposs balcony for Uncle Andrew, nor much patience with the York familyaposs inability to adjust their lestyle to suit their income. Andrew is therefore working against the clock -being a prince is what turns a buck, then how much of a prince can he be, in the time his mother has left  The answer must be: for as long as her family lets the Queen be so exploited.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sarah FergusonPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Saturday, a -word post about how he ed from the conflict as a changed man was posted to his ex-we Sarah Fergusonaposs Instagram account. Andrew, who reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement in a civil sexual assault case a few weeks ago, flew missions as a Sea King helicopter pilot during the war, which was  years ago. His reflection appeared in three posts - which were removed after about two hours. Beneath the last post, it said it was written by HRH The Duke of York before the HRH was deleted.  The Queen stripped Andrew of his honorary military roles in January and he gave up his HRH style in a dramatic fallout from his civil sex case. And now, The Times reports that both Buckingham Palace and Andrewaposs team were both unaware his account had been published online and were blindsided by it.In the first Instagram post, Sarah wrote: I asked Andrew this morning for his reflections on the anniversary of his sailing from Portsmouth to the Falkland Islands  years ago. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Andrewaposs account begins: As I sit here at my desk on this cold crisp spring morning thinking back to April  Iaposve tried to think what was going through my mind as we sailed out of Portsmouth lining the flight deck of HMS INVINCIBLE. The -year-old concluded: So whilst I think back to a day when a young man went to war, full of bravado, I ed a changed man. I put away childish things and  bravado and ed a man full in the knowledge of human frailty and suffering.  My reflection makes me think even harder and pray even more fervently for those in conflict today, for those familyaposstorn apart by the horrors they have witnessed.Like many royal watchers, author Robert Jobson was left baffled by Andrewaposs Falklands statement and is unsure what he hoped to achieve. He told The Mirror: I am not one of those who slam Prince Andrew because it is the latest - and perhaps easiest - media target. But the Duke of York’s bizarre decision to try to bolster his own image by waffling on about his Falklands war experiences on his ex-we’s Instagram account and also use the HRH title that has been stripped from him to sign off was an odd move. He continued: His ramblings about the Falklands - where we accept he fought with courage - shows how out of touch he is. He seems clueless about what people really think of him these days - a far cry from those days as the handsome and feted naval officer and pilot. It is unclearthis was a shameless comeback pitch or a last hurrah - by reminding people that he was once a war hero. But ato public le for the -year-old is not on the palace agenda and it won’t happen. Eventhe Queen has forgiven her favourite son, and believes in him, powerful figures in the palace corridors haven’t. Nor have the public.

The Blue Cross says ‘cherry eye’ commonly protrudes from the corner of the eye nearest the nose.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. They said: “Cherry eye is a common condition inherited in certain breeds of dog, and in rare cases, it can arise in cats. “Although unsightly, cherry eye doesn’t normally cause any discomfort to dogs or cats unless it is left untreated and complications occur.” But Mighty Midge wonapost have to suffer with cherry eye for much longer as vets will be correcting his condition when he is old enough to be neutered.  Despite being a tiny puppy, Mighty Midge is said to have a big character and is courageous, adventurous and super friendly with people and other dogs. An RSPCA statement reads: He just wants to please. He is into everything wanting to be involved. He sleeps in his little bed on the floor by the side of my bed all night. He is used to travelling in the car and it sends him to sleep in his carrier. He doesnapost wee or poo now until early morning. He is used to going in the garden but uses puppy pad too. He is a delightful little man with lots of love and kisses to give. We know he is a little dferent but this amazing baby also deserves his forever sofa, just like his siblings have found. The food-loving dog can live with children and other dogs - but still needs to learn that itaposs OK to be alone sometimes. He will need to be taken to training classes to help him grow into a well-rounded adult dog.

That being said, we had some lovely photographs last week of an audience in her own living room. Thataposs going to be happening more frequently now. When it comes to the royal diary, theyaposve got to prioritise quality over quantity. However, Camilla did add that there are some events that are sacrosanct in the royal diary, such as Prince Philipaposs memorial service - and for these, the Queen will do all she can to attend.

Camilla explained: Despite her own discomfort, she was determined to be there. Yes, concessions had to be made to ensure she was as comfortable as possible but itaposs these types of engagements she will move heaven and earth to attend. The monarchy is changing before our very eyes and arguably thataposs no bad thing.  What we think is the Queen isnapost having health problems but mobility problems - she canapost stand for long periods or walk for long distances and therefore accommodations are being made. I think the palace are handling this very much as they did when the Duke of Edinburgh retired and he was able to say which engagements he did or didnapost want to attend at very short notice.In order for the Queen to attend her beloved husbandaposs memorial service last week, military-style plans were put in place to sweep her there in the most comfortable way possible. She was transported from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace in a Land Rover, where she then swapped into her State Bentley. The Bentley then made the short journey to the Abbey escorted by police outriders and parked outside the Abbeyaposs discreet Poetsapos Yard entrance, which has fewer steps and is a shorter distance to where she was to sit for the service. Other special arrangements put in place for the Queen’s comfort were the service limited to  minutes and the monarch sitting in one of the Canada chairs but with an additional cushion.

Earlier this year, Andrew reached an out of court settlement with his accuser Virginia Giuffre in a civil sex claim filed in the US. It means that he avoided a potentially explosive trial with the settlement said to be £million. Andrew has continually denied the allegations against him. In January, he was stripped of his honorary military titles and patronages given to him by the Queen and it looked as though there was no way back for the Duke of York. But despite all this, the Mirroraposs royal editor Russell Myers has previously said that friends of Andrew say he still feels he has a lot to offer public le again. So do these signs below show he is trying to reinvent himself to play a more prominent role in the Royal Family Charity workJust months after Andrew put out a statement, approved by the Queen, that he would be quitting public le, he appeared on his ex-we Sarah Fergusonaposs Instagram account.A series of photos posted on her account in April  showed him putting together care packages for a local Windsor hospice.It led to criticism from royal biographer Tom Bower, who told MailOnline it was rather pathetic that heexploits the coronavirus crisis to creep back into the spotlight.However, fellow royal expert Richard Fitzwilliam did say at the time it was the sort of thing heought to be doing.Interview after Prince Philipaposs death Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. A year after this, the Queenaposs beloved husband and Andrewaposs father Prince Philip died at the age of  at Windsor Castle.In the aftermath of his death, Andrew was one of the first royals to publicly speak on camera about his fatheraposs passing.At a church service several days after Philipaposs death, Andrew said the monarch was feeling it more than everybody  but was remaining incredibly stoic, as he described his fatheraposs death as a terrible loss. It was his first public comment since his Newsnight interview - and just last week it was reported that members of the Royal household were left furious after Prince Andrew’s ‘completely inappropriate’ move right after Philip’s death. A source told the Mirror: “There is definitely a hand being played. “Hewas straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate.Supporting victims In February, it was revealed that Andrew had reached a settlement in his civil sex claim.In a statement included in court documents, he expressed his regret at his association with Epstein and also vowed to support sex trafficking victims.It said: Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.” And speaking on True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, Mirror royal editor Russell Myers said this could have been Andrewaposs way of positioning himself for ato public le. He explained: “The language used in this [settlement] statement is that Prince Andrew will be helping sex trafficking victims. Is this him positioning himself to try and reinvent himself in the eyes of the public He added: “He is only , but it is impossible to see how he could have any future. His daughter Princess Eugenie founded and helped run a charity for victims of trafficking. Maybe he sees that as an avenue, because possibly his family are the only ones who think they can help him at this stage.” Philipaposs memorial One of the most high-profile events Andrew has attended in recent years is Prince Philipaposs memorial service, which took place last week at Westminster Abbey.It had been revealed in advance he would be attending the service in honour of his late father - and the order of service seemed to suggest he would arrive alongside his daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.However, he ended up taking on a prominent role at the event by walking into the Abbey with his mother the Queen and escorting her to her seat.It was later reported that the Queen defiantly overruled heirs Prince Charles and Prince William to allow her disgraced son Andrew to have a special role at the ceremony.The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge “on more than one occasion” raised their concerns over the optics of allowing the shamed Duke of York to accompany his mother to the Westminster Abbey service last Tuesday. The future kings were “absolutely united” that it was “simply unnecessary” for Andrew to position himself as the only family member to escort the Queen to the church. But well placed sources have confirmed the -year-old monarch told them it was “her wish and final decision” that Andrew should chaperone her into the Abbey. Falklands War post  Meanwhile, this weekend, an account of Andrewaposs experience during the Falklands War was posted to his ex-we Fergieaposs Instagram account.Andrew flew missions as a Sea King helicopter pilot during the conflict and his reflection appeared in three posts - which were removed after about two hours. Beneath the last post, it said it was written by HRH The Duke of York before the HRH was deleted. The Queen stripped Andrew of his honorary military roles in January and he gave up his HRH style in a dramatic fallout from his civil sex case. At the time, a royal source said Andrew, who was born a HRH, will not use it in any official capacity. Like many royal watchers, author Robert Jobson was left baffled by Andrewaposs Falklands statement and is unsure what he hoped to achieve.  He tells The Mirror: I am not one of those who slam Prince Andrew because it is the latest - and perhaps easiest - media target. But the Duke of York’s bizarre decision to try to bolster his own image by waffling on about his Falklands war experiences on his ex-we’s Instagram account and also use the HRH title that has been stripped from him to sign off was an odd move. His ramblings about the Falklands - where we accept he fought with courage - shows how out of touch he is. He seems clueless about what people really think of him these days - a far cry from those days as the handsome and feted naval officer and pilot. It is unclearthis was a shameless comeback pitch or a last hurrah - by reminding people that he was once a war hero. But ato public le for the -year-old is not on the palace agenda and it won’t happen. Eventhe Queen has forgiven her favourite son, and believes in him, powerful figures in the palace corridors haven’t. Nor have the public. Derby Day appearance  Later this year a bumper four-day bank holiday weekend is planned for June with several events planned to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee.One of those events is the Derby, where it is hoped the Queen will attend.And according to royal sources, Andrew will accompany his mother to the event and act as her chaperone.A source told the Sun: “He was meant to stay invisible during the Platinum Jubilee so there is no way he will be at events like Trooping the Colour. “But the Queen needs a chaperone on all occasions at the moment due to her mobility issues and Andrew has earmarked the Derby as the one he will accompany her at. “He just doesn’t seem to understand the public outcry.”Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Images of Coldstone, Aberdeenshire, showed a very wintry scene of fields with several inches of snow.The bad news is that the Met Office is stating that the cold air “will win out eventually” during the end of the week. On Wednesday morning it is set to be another cold start in the north of Scotland with sub zero temperatures and ice that could cause traffic disruption - while it could be as high as C on the south coast. The Met Office is predicting showers for most of the country during the day with temperatures in the south getting into the mid-teens but by Wednesday night the weather will start to get more wintry. Maps from WXCharts show temperatures getting as low as -C on Thursday and could dip to -C over the weekend with widespread frost across the UK. Snow is also set to continue in Scotland with around  centimetres likely to fall and it will stretch further south with a covering of snow possible in the north of England.  Met office forecaster Susan Powell said: Through Wednesday evening but particularly overnight into Thursday the colder air mixes in with our weather fronts and it looks like we could see some signicant snow for northern Scotland once again. A risk of ice here for first thing Thursday certainly and potentially that wintry weather affecting the central belt of Scotland through the morning rush hour. We will see the showers thinning out as they sink south through the course of the day but still the chance of wintry element across the Pennines into Thursday afternoon.  Sunshine for many come Thursday afternoon but it will feel chilly especially in contrast to the start of the week. Then cold air right across the UK for Friday I think there will be quite a bit of sunshine, wintry showers in the north and east. There is some uncertainty over a low pressure to the south of the UK which could bring very wet weather and wind to the south coast on Friday whileit pushes further north it could lead to more snow. UK forecast for the next  days Rain or showers for most Today: Outbreaks of rain across northern Scotland. Elsewhere, a mixture of sunny spells and blustery showers, some heavy with a risk of hail and thunder. Gales around some coasts. Tonight: Rain or showers across Scotland moving southwards, turning to snow on hills. Clear spells central parts, with rain for a time in southern England. Windy with coastal gales. Thursday: Sunny spells and wintry showers across many parts of the UK showers heavy at times and most frequent in north. Cloudier in far south at first with outbreaks of rain. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Wintry showers across central and northern areas on Friday, perhaps some rain into southernmost counties for a time.

Bryn-y-Maen’s manager, Victoria Williams, said: “When Ellie arrived at the centre she was unsocialised and understandably nervous. “She’d been living rough in inappropriate conditions in a dilapidated outhouse with  other dogs and had never experienced a normal le, so we’ve worked really hard to build up her trust and confidence.  “For the first couple of months we’d sit outside her kennel and throw in high value treats for. “Once she was comfortable with that we fed her through the kennel bars before letting her out in the main block, leaving food bowls in dferent areas and gradually introducing more staff around her. “The next step was to get her used to a collar and a lead, and about three months after she arrived, she was finally ready to go for a walk. “It was really important not to rush Ellie and to let her do everything at her own pace. “We took in five other dogs from the same farm and whilst they have all been rehomed since, Ellie is still waiting. “She’s been with us a long time and has seen her friends from the barn all go off to new families, so we’d really love to see her settled and happy in her own home after everything she’s been through.” Ellie will need a quiet rural or semi rural environment with understanding owners who are going to be able to continue to build her confidence in an adult-only home as the only pet.

To make the perfect batter, Bart explains that you need ml of sunflower oil, four eggs, ml of whole milk and g of flour.He told the: My favourite way of making Yorkshire puddings is those non-stick  cup muffin trays.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. “Start by whisking your eggs to get some nice air in your batter which will make them rise beautully in the oven later. “Add your whole milk, and then sieve in the flour.” Sieving the flour means that there are no lumps in the batter mix. When well whisked, pour the batter into a jug so it’s easier to add to the Yorkshire pudding tray. Bart added: Preheat the oven to °C and pour the oil into the cups. We want about a cm of oil in each cup so don’t be shy! Heat up the muffin tray with the oil for about  minutes in the oven. When the muffin tray is nice and hot gently pour in the batter. Use a spoon to catch the drip in between switching cups as we don’t want any batter on the sides.This will burn, get bitter and prevent the puddings from rising freely. Cook the mix for around - minutes and donapost open the door once during this time he warns. If you do, youaposll release the heat your puds might deflate. Bart recommends serving the Yorkshires with a roast dinner, or for a more spring-inspired dinner - try stuffing them with crab meat, sour cream, lemon zest and herbs. You can also freeze any pre-cooked puddings you have leftover too so thereaposs no waste.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

She hoped it would apostake some years offapos and she had the treatment done before parentaposs evening at her -year-old sonaposs school. But after the treatment Mariana, from Northampton, East Midlands, took a turn for the worse and her face swelled up - and when she went to the school her son couldnapost recognise her. What do you think of the treatment  Let us know in the comments...Mariana, from Northampton, East Midlands, said: I wanted to take a couple of years off, hoping Iaposd look like I was turning  instead of . Iaposve got really droopy eyelids on the top and they literally hang on my eyelashes and I can see it - so itaposs not just looking at it, it literally annoys me for my vision. Iaposve also got excess skin and dark circles under my eyes so I was hoping that would help tighten the skin a little bit because itaposs dficult to put make-up on because thereaposs so much skin.Right after I just had red skin and little dots but when I woke up the next morning it was really, really swollen. On the second day I woke up it was super swollen everywhere - top and bottom - and then as the day progressed and the next day the swelling stayed but then my eyes became quite droopy as well. I knew what I was expecting but it was still a shock waking up and realising aposIaposve got to go to parentsapos evening and face my childaposs teachers looking like thatapos.  The teachers asked meI had an allergic reaction and I said aposno Iaposm just trying to look youngerapos. The mum-of-four says she couldnapost help but laugh about her extremely swollen eyes and having to face the teachers on parentsapos evening just one day after the appointment. Most of her family also found it funny, but she says her -year-old son seemed to uncover an unknown phobia, with the sight of the burnt dots around her eyes made him feel aposuncomfortableapos.

This left the teen unable to be in the same room as his mum for a few days and still unable to look at her face on Motheraposs Day. Mariana said: My family thought it was really funny but my son must have a fear of holes or something because he literally couldnapost even look at me or be in the same room as me. It made him feel really uncomfortable and it was funny because it was Motheraposs Day on Sunday and he was worried about how he was going to spend it with me, looking like that. Luckily some of the spots had gone by then and he could at least be in the same room as me evenhe couldnapost look at me. The anti-ageing treatment works by targeting the collagen and protein-producing cells in the skin, stimulating them and causing the area to tighten up. The hot current creates small holes in the skin’s layer which have to be allowed to heal properly to avoid complications like scarring and pigmentation.

Frank has been hand reared by farmer, Libbie Harris, , from Bristol, since he was born, as his mother didnapost have enough milk to feed him. But with two other lambs to feed, Libbie decided to teach Ted how to muck in - and he couldnapost be a cuter helping hand. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. In the video, Ted can be seen on his best behaviour, holding the bottle in the perfect spot while Frank tucks into his milk. Libbie explained: Ted is trained as a gun dog so he learnt how to pick things up with his mouth. I have to feed the lambs three times a day and realised I needed some help. Ted usually picks up pheasants when we go shooting so I thought I’d give it a go. He was able to hold the bottle straight away butit’s full its a bit too heavy. Now I give him the bottle to hold when it’s half empty then I can feed the other two at the same time. It is handy having extra help! The clever seven-year-old Lab has taken on the father role at the farm, and Libbie coins herself a apossurrogate mumapos to the orphaned lambs. She adds: I have eight working dogs but Ted is the most relaxed of the bunch. He likes to chill out and Frank will usually skip around him. I have hand reared Frank who is also known as fragile Frank as he was pretty weak when he was born. His mum had two lambs but not enough milk to feed them so it was better for his chance of survival to be hand reared. He is now thriving and loving le with his friend Ted.Ted isnapost the only farm dog going above and beyond to help orphaned animals - rescue dog Snow has become best friends with the foster calves.From playing to sleeping, eating and even snuggling, thereaposs absolutely nothing Snow wonapost do to stop the sweet baby cows from feeling sad and alone. Owner Krysten Pierre, , from Victoria, Australia, said: Part of me thinks that because Snow was orphaned and moved from home to home too, he kind of understands how the cows feel.Do you have a dog story to tell  Contact nia.dalton@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimalsPregnancy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes after the Tesla and SpaceX chief purchased a . per cent stake - worth billion- in Twitter Inc yesterday. Prior to announcing the purchase, Musk had criticised the micro-blogging site for failing to adhere to free speech principles and said he was contemplating building a new social media . But now the -year-old businessman cannot become the owner of more than .% of Twitteraposs common stock either as an inidual shareholder or a member of a group as long as he is a director of the brand, according to a company filing made today. Twitter Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal - who Musk previously ridiculed - said: Iaposm excited to share that weaposre appointing @elonmusk to our board.  In a tweet he added: Heaposs both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term. In response, Musk tweeted: Looking forward to working with Parag  Twitter board to make signicant improvements to Twitter in coming months. He recently ran a Twitter poll asking usersthey believed the  adheres to the principle of free speech. After disclosing his stake on Monday, Musk put out another poll on Twitter asking usersthey want an edit button, a long-awaited feature on which the social media  has been working. You can never underestimate Elon Musk. I wonder what the underlying motives are  said Gerald Goldberg, CEO of GYL Financial Synergies, a registered investment adviser, whose clients own both Twitter and Tesla shares. I think heaposs sending a message to the SEC that says, aposIaposm going to do what I want to doapos.  On Monday, Musk disclosed his ownership of . million Twitter shares, which are held by the Elon Musk Revocable Trust, of which he is the sole trustee. Musk will participate in the director benefits arrangements applicable to non-employee directors, the company said. Twitter will enter into its standard form of indemnication agreement with Musk, it added. Musk will serve as a Class II director, with the term expiring at Twitteraposs  annual meeting of stockholders. Twitter shares surged six per cent in trading before the opening bell, after closing up over  per cent on Monday.  The South African-Canadian entrepreneur - who in recent months has seen his wealth overtake Amazon founder Jeff Bezos - has said he is a free speech absolutist. He has been vocal against Web, a term for a utopian version of the internet that is decentralised and whose commercial backbone is the non-fungible token . Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Musk, though active proponents of cryptocurrencies, share skepticism around the metaverse, NFTs and Web, what some deem to be the evolution of the internet. Musk has previously called NFT profile pictures annoying. The worldaposs richest man will also be a board member of UFC-owner Endeavor until June  but has exited the board of tech non-profit OpenAI, which he co-founded, in . He is also the founder and CEO of SpaceX, and leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and infrastructure firm the Boring Company.

Border guards were told to look out for any boy that may look like him in case he was with other refugees leaving the country. Many people from around the world did get in touch with Anna but sadly none of them turned out to be Sasha. Now she has shared the tragic news on Facebook that Sasha’s body had been found and she thanked everyone for their help in trying to find him.She wrote: Today we found Sashaaposs body. I thank everyone who believed, who helped in the search, I thank everyone for your prayers and faith, I thank you for your support. Thanks to you, my son met me. Sasha, our little angel is already in heaven! Today his soul found peace.. Sasha had been with his grandma when they tried to escape advancing Russian troops and fearing all exits via road were blocked, they tried to leave by crossing the River Dnieper. Their group had two boats and little Sasha was the only one known to be wearing a le jacket. One of the boats capsized and the bodies of Sashaaposs gran and another woman were later found dead.  Anna had hoped that Sasha could have been with others who had been on the boat and was hiding in a village maybe cut off from the rest of Ukraine due to the war. She said in an earlier appeal: “We believe in a miracle and wait for any useful information. “None of this would have happenedit wasn’t for the war. It was the Russian troops who caused it. There were eight people in the boat. “My mother-in-law was found, another woman who was with them was discovered the next day. They were both dead. Six people, including Sasha, are being searched for. “But in those places hostilities are underway. There is hope that my boy managed to get to a nearby village, but it is not yet possible to check that.“There are the villages of Tolokun and Sukholuchye nearby, but people there have no electricity and communications for about a week.” Sasha had been staying with his paternal grandmother when the region came under acute threat from advancing Russians. “My little son - our only child - was staying with his beloved grandmother Zoya, , when the war began,” she said. “They were in a small village with only two shops and two days after the start of the invasion all the food was gone. “The longer they stayed there, the worse it got with supplies and electricity. The three last days before they decided to escape by boats there was no electricity for three days.  “We were trying to get to them several times, or to get them out by road, but each time we had to turn cars back because of shelling.” She said: “Trying to escape from occupation, they ventured across Kyiv reservoir [on the Dnieper, also known as the Kyiv Sea] taking two dogs. “Connection with them was lost. Sasha’s granny was found dead on [March] , we could not collect her body, and asked locals to bury her.

The longer you stand the more dangerous it becomes,” she says.The last time we spoke three weeks ago Valentina had been evacuating Irpin. Living in the Red Cross office in Kyiv with her colleagues since the outbreak of war she sounded ferociously resilient. Her ability to steel herself to war, at least on the surface, was awe inspiring for a medical student barely beyond her teens. On Sunday night she speaks through heavy layers of fatigue, audibly eroded by what she has witnessed and the relentless days of caregiving and risk. She is more withdrawn, more distracted. She struggles to remember dates, timescales, details. She has ed home just once, for half an hour, three days ago, to “collect necessities.” She recalls in Bucha going to evacuate an elderly couple who had not left their apartment for around three weeks as fighting raged around them. To get to them they had to pass through a checkpoint. “We said we had come to take an old lady and an old man,” she describes. “They checked our car and then allowed us to go to the house.” They did not answer her knocks at the door for a very long time, to the point where she and the team became nervous.  She recalls: “The door opened in the end. The building was partly destroyed and there were a lot of unexploded missiles in the yard. “They wanted to catch their cat, get their things, but at last we could take them with us in the car. We told them to hurry, we are risking our lives. “When they realised they were in a safe car with safe people they calmed down. “They told us they were freezing, there was no heating or electricity. They had little food, they were scared they would starve.” In the centre of Bucha, Valentina collected wounded men from a hospital. “Their legs were shot through,” she says. The -year-old is careful as she chooses her words. She cannot feel emotion, she says, because it would not allow her to do her work. Fresh from two nights and days helping in a Kyiv hospital, she admits: “For now I don’t think it affected me, because I was ready for it. “There is a lot of emotion but I can’t express it, I have to stay neutral. I am trying to stay as calm as possible. I will try and deal with this afterwards when everything will end and I’m in a safer place.” For now, she says Kyiv is a little quieter. There are fewer air raid sirens. She admits she barely knows how le is looking on the streets as she has no time to absorb it. But she is wary “everything can change in one or two days or hours” and airstrikes are still a threat. For the next couple of days Valentina will rest as a curfew stops her and her teams ing to Bucha and surrounding areas. The military must make the heavily-mined areas safe. Then, the young woman willto support those civilians who are left in the debris, as best she can.

Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov leads the th Separate Motorised Rle BrigadeThe aftermath of the massacre in Bucha Image: via REUTERSByChris Hughes in the Carpathian Mountains, Ukraine:,  Apr |comments The Kremlin is sending troops suspected of the Bucha massacre straight back to the frontline to sacrice them, it was claimed today. But there are mounting fears they are also prepared to commit even more barbaric war crimes in other areas of Ukraine to the east of the country.Ukrainian spies believe the notorious th Motorised Rle Brigade will be sent into battle “hotspots” with little chance of survival, as the Kremlin scrambles to try and avoid them being alive for war crimes trials. Today Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence Agency said: ”Russian command will not rotate personnel in this unit and will throw them back to the frontline. “The Russian servicemen who committed atrocities in Bucha are being ed to Ukraine. “The th Motorised Rle Brigade of the th All Russian Army whose servicemen committed mass murder and tortured civilians will be ed to Ukraine.”Sources said they believe Russia wants the men to be killed so there will be no living witnesses to the Bucha killings. They are thought to include “Butcher of Bucha” Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the th Separate Motorised Rle Brigade. After his troops pulled out of Bucha more than  corpses were discovered of civilians, many of them with their hands tied and executed with a bullet to the head. Torture chambers have been found, where men were brutally beaten before being killed and the bodies of women and children have also been discovered. The remains have been removed from the town and are being examined by forensic experts preparing to present evidence in future war crimes trials. Today’s statement from intelligence chiefs added: “Another goal of the rapidof the th Brigade to the territory of Ukraine is the rapid disposal of unnecessary witnesses. “That is redeployment to a section of the front where they will have no chance of surviving to make it impossible to testy in future courts.” It goes on to claim the disgraced troops have opposed the move but they have been ignored and will get just two days’ leave before going back into battle.  Russia is under increasing pressure as its military has now suffered a death toll of almost , in almost six weeks of fighting. Moscow’s forces are continuing to suffer huge losses, retreating from major cities in central Ukraine, heading north from Kyiv and east towards Donbas. They have left dead bodies booby-trapped and trip-wires attached to grenades and mines in their wake, adding to the horror facing ing civilians. Luhansk governor Sergiy Gaiday said Russia is planning a major attack in the region as he ordered a mass evacuation. It is feared , Russian reservists are being called up to bolster a fresh offensive in the east in contested Donbas and possibly Kharkiv.  Today Ukraine also revealed the Kremlin is planning more horric “ flag” provocations - resorting to using the remains of Mariupol’s citizens. Kyiv’s SBU intelligence agency believes Kremlin spooks plan to pile more horror on the stricken port by claiming the dead were massacred by Ukraine. The agency - Ukraine’s equivalent of MI- said: “According to available date the occupiers are preparing a large-scale falsication. “They plan to gather in one place the bodies of Mariupol residents killed by the Russians themselves and present them as mass victims of Ukrainian troops. “False theories have been circulating that ‘Ukrainians are using civilians as human shields. This is an outright delusion.”  Sources have told the Daily Mirror that Ukraine’s intelligence agencies have had huge support from western intelligence, especially the UK and US. It has led to Moscow’s covert operations and  flag plans being leaked repeatedly as Ukraine has been able to second-guess the Kremlin. The Mirror understands that much of this intelligence has been hoovered up by British spy planes patrolling the region in the build-up to the invasion. Ukraine has also had constant updates from western allies on telephone conversations and other communications between Russian commanders. Today NATO warned of a fresh offensive by Russia in the east of Ukraine.  The alliance’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: “We are seeing a new face of the war.” He added that Putin’s troops are being “remanned” and “rearmed” ahead of a “new, very concentrated Russian offensive in Donbas.” The Donbas region has been heavily contested between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists backed by regular Moscow troops for over eight years. The war in east Ukraine was triggered by the pro-European Maidan protests in  which led to Putin ordering the annexing of Crimea and the arming of separatists. Moscow’s GRU spooks also spread lies via puppet media throughout the region and Russia about Kyiv’s government being supported by “fascists.” Putin’s argument for the invasion of “denazication” has been justied by the  narrative already spread about nazis being re in Ukraine.

It comes as mounting evidence of war crimes committed by Russian forces in the city near capital Kyiv will be discussed by a United Nations Security Council today. The Ukrainian President - who was seen holding back tears as he visited the aftermath on Monday - will address the council, which is pushing to ensure justice is done. Volodymyr Zelensky surveyed the alleged atrocities near capital Kyiv, describing the discovery of raped women and murdered children among the dead. He was accompanied by defending servicemen after invading troops had retreated from the area. US President Joe Biden called for Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to face a war crimes trial, adding he is now seeking further sanctions against Russia. This guy is brutal and whataposs happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyoneaposs seen it, he said in an impassioned speech last night.  Ukrainian officials have vowed to hunt down the butchers of Bucha after hundreds of dead civilians were discovered. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the th Separate Motorised Rle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area. Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands are growing for accountability over atrocities by Vladimir Putinaposs forces. Zelensky has warned that worse evidence of mass killings of civilians by Moscow will emerge as the Russian president repositions his troops to the south-east.  It will be his first address to the Security Council, whose presidency is held by the UK, with members including Russia and China. The Ukrainian leader accused Moscow of committing real genocide, as he appeared visibly emotional, flanked by his soldiers and wearing a bullet-proof vest. Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said Mr Zelensky will give all the evidence to the international community at the Security Council meeting. If these awful atrocities will not change the agenda of all the world, what will change  the adviser asked on BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Mr Zhovkva said Ukraine needs additional weapons, including tanks and missiles, to liberate more cities from Russia control. Dame Barbara Woodward, Britainaposs UN ambassador, called images coming from Bucha harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide. She cited hundreds of bodies being dumped in the streets or in mass graves and allegations of rape. Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs.  He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all  How do I explain this to myself, how  “They must cease to exist. They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.”Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identied the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia - and a number of other Russian military units. Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: In Bucha there was a military unit  from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region... “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name. InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit  of the th Separate Motorized Rle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha.  In the city, too, according to the Ukrainians, were forces from the Fth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of th army of the Russian Eastern military district, the st Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision, the th Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision, the th and th Air Assault Regiments of the th Guards Air Assault Division,  and  separate guard brigades of special purpose the rd special operational regiments of the Russian national guard, and the th separate guards brigade of marines of the Pacic Fleet.  So far no commanders have been named from these forces apart from Omurbekov. Russian sources have hit back claiming the Ukrainians were responsible for the atrocities in Bucha and other locations - and are the ones guilty of war crimes. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these  accusations.” He said: ”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March . “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself.  I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces.ed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered  tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, said: “There are no doubts that it is a staging organised by Kyiv authorities. “And the fact that the West has picked it up and is hyping it makes it an accomplice of this cynical and immoral crime.”  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia. I think that the very fact that these statements were made minutes after these materials were released leaves no doubts as for who has contracted this story, she told state-run Rossiya- television channel. The West decided immediately Russia was to blame “based on the videos, seconds-long videos and several photos. “And they are ready to pour accusations. “No expert work done, no information from the other side throwing light on what is going on... She claimed the massacres were a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks. Also today, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will hold talks with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, during the second day of her visit to the capital, Warsaw. She has called for Russia to be hit with the maximum level of sanctions and for more weapons to be supplied to Mr Zelenskyaposs forces to help repel the Kremlinaposs troops. The idea that we should wait for something  bad to happen is just completely wrong, she said, applying pressure to allies. The reality is that money is still flowing from the West into Putinaposs war machine - and that has to stop. She pressed for a clear timetable to eliminate imports of Russian oil, gas and gold, and for a further crackdown on industries financing Moscowaposs invasion. Polandaposs prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the voices of German businesses rather than the innocents slain in Ukraine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday.

During the UK-convened meeting of the UNaposs most powerful body, whose membership includes Russia, Mr Zelensky called for those responsible to be brought to justice in a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials.Zelensky warned the world is yet to see the acts committed by the Kremlinaposs troops in other regions after evidence of atrocities was unearthed after their withdrawal from Bucha, near Kyiv.Today, as a result of Russiaaposs actions in our country, in Ukraine, the most terrible war crimes weaposve seen since the end of World War Two are being committed, he said in the virtual address. Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from the hostilities. They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from air strikes. The massacre in our city of Bucha is unfortunately only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past  days.  Mr Zelensky, in his first address to the council, accused Russia of wanting to turn Ukraine into silent slaves and its military of wide-scale looting, stealing everything from food to bloodied jewellery. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine, he said. Anyone who has given criminal orders and carried out them by killing our people will be brought before the tribunal, which should be similar to the Nuremberg tribunals.  Mr Zelensky played allies a video appearing to show bound, killed and burned civilians and mass graves in images from across his nation that the UKaposs ambassador to the UN Dame Barbara Woodward described as harrowing. Meanwhile, on the second day of her trip to Warsaw, Ms Truss reiterated her vow to use Thursdayaposs meeting of G and Nato allies to press for further sanctions. Having met Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and her Polish counterpart, she said economic actions so far are having a crippling impact and pushing the Russian economy back into the Soviet era.  She said the West has frozen more than  billion US dollarsof Putinaposs war chest, rendering unavailable over % of the regimeaposs  billion US dollarsof foreign currency reserves. But she said they must go further, to include further cracking down on Russian banks and going after industries that are filling Putinaposs war chest, like gold, and agreeing a clear timetable to eliminate our imports of Russian oil, coal and gas. Mr Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the voices of German businesses rather than the innocents killed in Ukraine.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday.The UK, which currently holds the Security Councilaposs presidency, convened the meeting to discuss seeking justice over the mounting evidence of war crimes.  Mr Zelensky made his address a day after visiting Bucha to witness the fallout and warning of further atrocities as the Russian president repositions his troops from around the capital to the south east. Russiaaposs envoy to the UN Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya also addressed the meeting, disputing the evidence of atrocities in Bucha, criticising Mr Zelensky and repeating baseless allegations of Nazism among Kyivaposs leadership. However, the Kremlinaposs claims that the footage of bodies in the town has been staged has been contradicted by satellite images showing corpses in the street nearly two weeks before Russians fled the town. The Nuremberg trials were held to bring Nazi war criminals to justice following the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany in . The court cases, held in  and , tried the criminal actions of German professionals, industrialists, the SS, and the military officers tied to Adolf Hitler.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreSimon joined the Department of Work and Pensions as a work coach two years ago after  years in sales and marketing in the private sector.

which more accurately reflected the constituent countries might be considered,’ explained Mrs Michie.‘For example, Wales and Northern Ireland are not included in the Union Jack,’ she added.The document stated that, for many, the Union Jack had been ‘devalued’ in modern times by its ‘association with the Tory Party and the National Front’ and the national anthem had been similarly hijacked by the English rugby team.Commented Mrs Michie: ‘The media did not report that the anthem and flag belonged to the Queen and Country and that I was concerned that they were being taken over by some to

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

It’s a hormone which helps build trust and attachment, as opposed to cortisol, which increases stress levels.We do sometimes need cortisol when faced with a challenge or fearful situation, so it does have its . It’s part of our fight and flight response. But the problem arises when levels remain too high for an extended period of time, as this keeps our bodies under a constant state of stress.When this happens, it can cause anxiety and depression, but also lots of physical issues such as headaches and tummy pain. It’s very dficult to concentrate and remember things when we are in this state.The study showed that for children in hospital, a time full of stress and worry for many reasons, storytelling resulted in an increase in oxytocin levels and reduction of cortisol, and so made the children feel less anxious and stressed, and even helped ease their physical pain.While the context of this research was children in the very stressful situation of being in hospital, I think the results and conclusions are also relevant for children in other stressful settings, including at school and home. I’m not making a direct comparison, but we’ve not had ‘normal times’ recently, and even in usual times, high levels of stress can be a big issue for many. So levels of stress and anxiety are heightened, even beyond the ‘normal’ for many of us.Some of the language in the article is related to the science of the findings, but the conclusions and observations are things teachers, parents and storytellers of all kinds will recognise. It describes how children being told the story “are transported to another possible world during storytelling sessions” and can “elicit positive physiological and psychological changes”. In other words, it can have a positive effect on physical and mental health.This transportation to “another possible world” is what storytellers often refer to as the story trance. It’s when children are absorbed in a story, and taken by their imagination to the world the story creates. The report explains that this absorption stimulates ious parts of the brain and aids the listener’s development of empathy, as well as a better understanding of their own emotions.None of this is really surprising, of course. But it’s really useful to have this kind of scientic back-up. An important finding was that the stories told were ones widely available and not specically adapted for therapeutic use just the kind of tales you find in a book from the library.And while they used professional storytellers for the research, a key point was that everyone can have this impact, including parents and caregivers: “It is important to note that even though we have used experienced storytellers for our research purposes, we believe that parents should be encouraged to tell their children stories. As we have shown, it is not necessary to use special stories or books or even specic techniques to achieve a successful outcome. Storytelling can be an effective means of creating important emotional bonds.”As I have said, this study looked at the impact of storytelling for children in hospital, which can be a deeply distressing time for both child and parents.Reading the report made me remember the time I was seven years old in the Western General Hospital, in an isolation ward by myself, very ill. I was told a story about a dragon who lived in a castle, and was given a model castle, made from used toilet rolls, and painted silver. I’d look at it when I was alone, which I always was except for visits. It was a stage for my imagination. I’d speak to the dragon and imagine the adventures I’d have with him when I finally got out of hospital. These stories were always my secret, but they helped me get out of hospital and have fun, when in the real world I could do neither.The thing is, our kids, as well ourselves, need this. The story is part of it, the characters, the challenges, the suspense, the connection to the emotions in the tale. It all works on our brain and our being. But it’s also the process of storytelling: the togetherness it creates, the shared space and attention, the heart-to-heart connection, the stimulation of imagination. Not even the best film on a screen does that.We are all storytellers, but sometimes it is good to be reminded just how important it is to be so, and that includes listening to, as well as telling, stories.As the report concluded: “Stories possess a symbolic dimension that seems to create a natural bridge to the core of our humanity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leading-pig-farmers-plea-cabinet-secretary","story":"Mairi Gougeon MSP was accompanied by county MSP Paul McLennan on the visit to one of several high-health pig farms run by Mr Wyllie.Pig farms across Scotland are all operating at a substantial and growing loss.Mr Wyllie, of Ruchlaw Mains, Stenton, estimates that losses of about £ per pig in February last year have since deepened to more than £ per pig. Overdrafts are rising at an alarming rate and several Scottish farmers have already sold off sows to cut losses.The pig sector encountered signicant disruption during the Covid- pandemic which affected processing capacity and saw the partial closure of Scotland’s largest pig abattoir facility at Brechin.Much to the disappointment of NFU Scotland, several major retailers have continued to stock signicant volumes of imported pork, undermining, the union says, home production.And the dramatic spike in animal feed prices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also signicantly increased the scale of current losses on pig farms.It is in the interests of Scottish consumers, processors, and retailers, adds the union, that farmgate prices for pigs rise immediately to stave off a rapid rate of herd liquidations.Speaking on behalf of NFU Scotland, Mr Wyllie thanked the Cabinet Secretary for the pig hardship scheme in Scotland, established following the Covid-driven closure of the Brechin abattoir, but called on her to consider further immediate, direct support for the sector to ensure a critical mass of production was preserved.He also asked for the Scottish Government to consider an ‘Ongoers’ loan scheme to help financially support those who saw their future in the industry.NFU Scotland called on the Scottish Government to seek greater retailer support for Scottish pork, highlighting that a small percentage increase in the volume of home-produced pork on supermarket shelves would make a considerable dference.Help in re-establishing the Chinese export licence at Brechin, lost because of the Covid outbreak at the plant, would also expand the market opportunities for Scottish pig producers.At a UK level, NFU Scotland called for the Scottish Government to push Westminster on the need for “proper border controls” to monitor pork imports and for the English language requirements for overseas butchers looking to come to the UK to work in the staff-strapped processing sector to be relaxed."},{"url":null,"title":"six-county-schools-come-together-climate-change-event","story":"Teams of  pupils had to produce a plan for a product or initiative and an accompanying poster and presentation, which was made to a judging .Belhaven Hill School hosted the event, which was attended by pupils from Gordonstoun Junior School, Strathallan Prep School, Ardvreck, Fettes Prep and Cargilfield, earlier this month.The categories for the climate change event were defined by the annual Earthshot Prize, with each team choosing from: the restoration and protection of nature air cleanliness ocean revival waste-free living and climate action.Olly Langton, Belhaven Hill headmaster, said: “We want to ensure our pupils know that they can have a signicant impact on their environment now and in the future.“So my we Rosie and I came up with the idea of developing a Community of Prep and Primary Schoolsin Scotland to energise the children and bring them together to form an alliance to protect the things they love.“We were also keen to involve members of the local Dunbar community, where there is a strong environmental ethos which encourages collaboration.”The teams presented to a  of judges from the sustainability sector: Jonathan Hodges, senior innovation engineer at Wave Energy Scotland Duncan Lang, senior environment specialist at the Asian Development Bank and Izzy Heard, technical officer for the Climate Disclosure Project.The lists introduced themselves before watching each -minute presentation and giving immediate feedback.The teams completed a number of environmentally themed talks and activities, while Surfers Against Sewage encouraged youngsters to ‘Think Global Act Local’.“It was a pleasure to hear the great ideas and passionate presentations from this next generation of climate-aware thinkers,” said Mr Hodges.“The projects started by these students have already created positive change in their schools and communities, and I have no doubt they will follow-up with more.”In the afternoon, pupils took part in the Scottish Prep Schools Debating Championship – the motion challenged the children to consider whether short-haul flights should be banned.Edinburgh’s Cargilfield triumphed in both competitive elements of the day.The prize for outstanding inidual award on the day went to a pupil from Ardvreck, who went away with a voucher for a surfing lesson at Belhaven Bay, thanks to the generosity of CoastCoast.The next day, the bay was also the location for the first ForthSHORE beach clean by pupils from Belhaven with GreenTweed Eco.All the children took away a bird box, thanks to the East Lothian Primary Schools Bird Box Project, sponsored by ArdMoor, and a certicate.The next stage of the venture is for all of the schools to take part in a joint fundraising venture in the summer term.

Poverty is very much still with us, even within our most well-off communities. East Lothian Council has an updated poverty strategy and the local area partnerships have had specic funding to tackle poverty and inequalities.The pandemic, Brexit and the war in Ukrainehave all added to the pressures on prices of le’s basics, from food to transport and utilities. A rural area like ours has many who rely on heating oil, which is now about £ a litre. Many in the villages have no public transport and need to run a car.I attend the East Lothian Friendly Food Network – a council-supported network of those involved in food from across the county. Many of those who attend are from the county’s foodbanks and community pantries.The Scottish Government recently ran a consultation on how the need for foodbanks may be ended. However, all facilities in East Lothian report growing calls for support.Those needing help include, as well as those on benefits, increasing numbers of those on low pay who find that the cost of basics is a growing proportion of their weekly income.There have been mounting calls for food that does not need cooking. There are increasing requests for help to pay for gas and electricity. The charges to those on prepaid meters are higher and the top-ups on a card last for much less time than before.One organisation has been giving hot water bottles as it’s cheaper to boil a kettle to fill a bottle than turn the heating on. Organisations across the county are arranging free community meals. Breakfast club provision for children is expanding to ensure children do not go to school hungry.I recently attended a national conference where the cost of living crisis was debated. The experience identied in East Lothian is replicated across the UK.The Chancellor’s Spring Statement could have given much more help than it did. Benefits and state pension remain lagging behind the rate of inflation and could have been increased VAT could have been reduced on fuel for heating, lighting and cooking the uplt in Universal Credit could have been restored the increase in National Insurance waived. Sadly, those with the least income are those who lost out and will continue to see the cost of living eating into their weekly money pot.In the meantime, residents can continue to support the many excellent local organisations offering support, whether as donations of food, money or volunteering time.

There is something about this trio that makes you feel they should be driving a camper van and have a dog called Scooby Doo. Whatever: after years of slight awkwardness they have gelled nicely.The first of nine regional visits was to the Highlands.

Opportunity had knocked now, however, much to their delight.: A sneak peek inside cutest propertyThere had already been one casualty in their battle to have a magazine standard home complete with mustard-coloured velour sofa. “We no longer let our wee dog Ghost on the bed or couch since moving here,” confessed Ciara. Across Scotland, smirking dog lovers placed bets on how long that would last.With Lorne Cottage cheered to the rafters for its “cute as a button” look it was on to The Tower, a church conversion in the Black Isle dating from the s and modernised in the s. This was home to Rachel, Rob and dog Tia, who was allowed on the couch.Rachel had wanted to downsize to a small fishing village, but ended up with a gaff that could host a medium-sized royal wedding.

Home to Rory, Eilidh and the youngest of their six children, Loch Lann had Anna’s favourite thing, a hanging chair, which she rushed to try. Then again, the house had pretty much everything crammed into it, including a golden bath from Paris, so the chances of a hanging chair were good.Michael said the place called to mind a George Bernard Show quote: “Some people see the world and ask why, and there are others that dream of things that never were and say why not ” Personally, I was thinking “nightmare to clean” but each to their own.: SHOTY judge on Skyes charmsThe winner, Lorne Cottage, should answer some of the criticism levelled at previous series: that SHOTY is all about fancy homes and expensive, designer-led style, what you might call a faux fur throw and nae knickers approach to home decoration. But Lorne Cottage won largely because the judges took to its vibe straight away. Who hasn’t done that when falling for a home On to the final, then, for Ciara, Arran, and Ghost.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year. Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing on the placement.

That is all. 🙌 pic DrxwpfqNO— Liverpool FCApril , It was a goal which signicantly changed the game for a long period, as Benfica suddenly looked the better side with Liverpool completely out of sorts, but Diaz had the final word to make thelook slightly more comfortable than it had done.Victory saw Liverpool, who had lost on their last three visits here, equal a club record of five successive away victories in Europe.The omens had not been great for Benfica, third in Portugal’s Primeira Liga  points behind leaders Porto – whom Liverpool had hammered - and - in the group stages this season.Of the six changes Klopp made, the best one was bringing right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold in after almost three weeks out with a hamstring injury.His pass for Diaz to head into Mane’s path for the second goal was a thing of wonder, while the one he delivered for a strangely off-colour Mohamed Salah to race onto but shoot straight at goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos was almost as good.It was the first time Klopp had started the midfield trio of Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Naby Keita, with the latter impressing in attacking areas. vw,vw,px, px\"Naby Keita, left, impressed against Benfica In the opening  minutes the midfielder almost operated as a fourth forward, joining the attack to have four shots of his own before the break to underline the visitors’ dominance.That they only had a two-goal lead to their name was nothing short of criminal considering the opportunities which fell to Keita, Diaz, Salah – three times – and Alexander-Arnold.Konate eventually made the crucial th-minute breakthrough when Diaz won a corner which Andy Robertson swung to the far post, where the defender easily out-jumped Everton to beat the goalkeeper with a downward header.But better was still to come as Alexander-Arnold’s crossfield ball was laid on a plate for Diaz to nod into Mane’s path and the Senegal international could not miss from close range, going past Steven Gerrard’s total of  Champions League goals. vw,vw,px, px\"Sadio Mane, right, scores Liverpool’s second goal Half-time brought another club record as Liverpool went  matches without conceding a first-half goal, although they had barely been troubled with Everton coming closest with a shot into the side-netting.Four minutes into the second half that all changed after Konate’s calamity trying to deal with Rafa Silva’s low cross.The goal altered the mood in the stadium and the momentum on the pitch and Klopp’s triple change of Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota and Jordan Henderson for Mane, Salah and Thiago attempted to restore control.🎼 \"EU AMO O BENFICA, LA LA LA…\" ❤🤍#EPluribusUnum #SLBLIV #UCL pic JBaHoEQlu— SL BenficaApril , Further Konate misjudgements caused more problems with Alisson Becker first having to parry Everton’s low shot and then, after the defender went chasing a ball he could never win, Nunez had a penalty claim rejected after tumbling under Virgil Van Dijk’s challenge.The pressure seemed to be getting to even the best, with Van Dijk’s air-kick in the centre-circle a brief moment of concern while Alisson also duffed a couple of clearances.But just when it looked like frustration would get the better of them, Keita’s perfect through-ball allowed Diaz to round the goalkeeper and slot home an angled shot.On the last two occasions the teams met in the quarter-finals of this competition, in  and , Liverpool went on to lt the trophy and Diaz’s goal put them well on their way to the last four this time."},{"url":null,"title":"jurgen-klopp-insists-liverpool-should-scored-more-win-benfica  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Good teams tend to use that.“The game was slightly more open then we wished but in the end we scored and I think everyone in the room would agree we could have scored more goals and should have.“We would have wished we didn’t give them the opportunity to come back in the game.“It was an away game in the Champions League quarter-final andthat was easy something would be wrong with the competition.” vw,vw,px, px\"Benfica fans created an intense atmosphere in Lisbon Victory equalled a club record of five successive away wins in the competition first set in , but also matched in  when the club played three Champions League qualiers.However, Klopp will not take theleg for granted as his side’s quest for an unprecedented quadruple took another step forward.“We were two goals up at half-time today and we knew it was not easy,” he added.“Benfica really wanted to go for it. Now they come to Anfield and we have to use that.”Klopp made six changes for the game, resting the likes of Joel Matip ahead of Sunday’s top-of-the-table trip to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.But the manager said that match had not been in his thoughts in Portugal.“I didn’t think a second until now about the City game, so I couldn’t make changes for the game,” he said.A good result to take back to Anfield. The focus now turns to Sunday.. pic RcyhGAuAv— Virgil van DijkApril , Benfica caretaker coach Nelson Verissimo knows the concession of that late goal has made their task much more dficult.“The tie is not over. We are aware it is harder now,” he said.“We suffered from a corner but felt at half-time the game was not over.“I tried to inject some confidence into my players as we wanted to score a goal to get ourselves back in it and the second half started like we wanted.“In they end they scored again and that makes our task all that much harder but not impossible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"exhibition-celebrating-british-pop-culture-launch-manchester  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

It’s one of our biggest cultural exports.”She added: “People outside of Britain,you talk to them about pop music or the music they like, they will often talk about British music.“And in terms of TV and film too, I think we have unique stories to tell there.“British TV is famous throughout the world so it’s that sense of the importance of British popular culture as a particularly unique export.Mat Bancroft, curator of the British Pop Archive, said: “We launch the British Pop Archive with a Manchester-focused exhibition full of unique and unseen artefacts. These materials tell the story of a vibrant city with art, culture and music at its heart.”The exhibition will explore elements of the highly recognisable Manchester pop scene with items relating to The Hacienda nightclub, the Factory Records record label, and some of the city’s most memorable bands including Joy Division and The Smiths. vw,vw,px, px\"From Manchester With Love poster designed in  “We even have a pair of trainers in one of the archives,” said Ms Barker.She added: “It’s in Kevin Cumming’s archive – he’s a rock photographer and he has a pair of Hacienda trainers, unworn, in the original box.”The archive will subsequently be expanded to become a national collection, and create a comprehensive representation of British popular culture.Ms Barker credited the idea for the project to the death of Buzzcocks singer Pete Shelley and The Fall vocalist Mark E Smith, and wondering whether the musicians had archives and what would become of them.As part of the creation of the archive, conversations were had with iniduals who were heavily involved in development of the British pop culture scene during the s and ’s including The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr.Ms Barker told PA: “One of our biggest supporters is Johnny Marr, so I got to meet him and talk about the project and I got to talk to other people and the family members of people involved.”She added: “People are often really keen to ensure that that things stay in public hands, because a lot of this stuff is the sort of thing that could easily be sold on auction sites.“So it’s great to be able to keep records of businesses or inidual lives publicly available.”– Collection, launching the British Pop Archive will run from May  until January   at the John Rylands Research Institute and Library at the University of Manchester."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-290-april-5-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649069162491.jpg--housing_provider_choice_and_trussell_trust_support_ni_families_in_need.jpg?1649069171000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220404newshousing provider choice and trussell trust support ni families in need","story":"Local housing association, Choice Housing has partnered with the Trussell Trust to provide food parcels to families in need across Northern Ireland. With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by.

The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.

Convicted of “harming by magical means” they narrowly avoided a death sentence.“Research suggests that Mary Dunbar’s symptoms of bewitchment were demonic possession: fits, swearing, throwing Bibles, vomiting household objects and trances.”The accused women were also alleged to have attacked her in spirit form, but there are strong suspicions Dunbar was faking her possession.“Being possessed allowed her to misbehave without consequence, move from invisibility to notoriety within her community and attack her elders at will,” Dr Sneddon continued.“Dunbar chose to blame her possession on the witchcraft of the Presbyterian Islandmagee women because they had reputations locally as witches and failed to meet contemporary standards of female behaviour and beauty.“Some were physically disabled, others swore and drank alcohol. All were poor. The local male authorities believed Dunbar’s version of events because she was beautul, educated and from a respected family. The accusations were also used to further local political goals at a time of intense party political conflict between the two main political parties of the day, the Whigs and the Tories.“From a modern perspective we might see the conviction as unjust, but from a historical point of view, there was nothing unjust about it. The women were tried under a law, according to due legal process and convicted by a jury,” he said.“We have a timeless fascination with witches and witchcraft,” he added. “It’s easy to forget that it was a crime in most places in Europe until the th century, when an accusation of witchcraft could have terrible consequences.”Dr McCollum, a leading authority on the use of creative arts and modern media to bring history to le, said the project showcases the importance of visual arts and how it complements the understanding, commemorating and recording of historical events.“We decided that a visual verbal format could enrich the public’s understanding of iniduals weighed down and destroyed by the past: the graphic novel is well placed to open our eyes to erased chapters from our past,” she said.Supported by a website, video game, original score, and virtual reality experience, the project brings an important part of Ireland’s cultural heritage to le.The website acts as a gateway to an online game, where the user takes the role of a witch-finder and explores the moral choices involved in accusing someone of witchcraft in .Related topicsUniversity of UlsterMore On University of Ulster PremiumTaoiseach gives terror threats short shrt during low-key trip across borderDerry Girls creator Lisa McGee honoured at Ulster University ceremony PremiumBlackout: What would a full-scale cyber attack on Northern Ireland look like  PremiumJon TongeOpinionBurnham and Rotheram united Manchester and Liverpool, so anything’s possible for Belfast PremiumViewpointOpinionNot much help with cost of living crisisMost ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilLatest EducationTaoiseach: We must do better to create a fairer education system in Northern Ireland’s schoolsJon TongeOpinionUniversities fail to make the grade on tackling outdated traditionsViewpointOpinionIntegrated schools failure shames NINI schools facing drop in psychological support servicesNorthern Ireland schools are ‘too afraid’ to promote Covid jabsLatestFootball rumours: PSG make offer to Manchester United’s Paul PogbaFundraiser and D-Day hero Harry dies aged Rosalind SkillenOpinionFashion must not become something that costs the earthSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claimsAlex KaneOpinionAlex Kane: Rallies have yet to explain why protocol has had such an impact on unionists,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One candidate is standing and he has as much hope of getting elected as Michelle O’Neill has of securing the leadership of the DUP.“It’s the last throw of the dice for Northern Ireland Conservatives. They’re about to become an extinct species. The party’s failure to deal with the isive and obnoxious Northern Ireland Protocol is to blame forelectoral demise.“My former party has driven a coach and four through UK sovereignty. They’ve uncoupled Northern Ireland from the rest of the kingdom and have failed to grasp the enormity of their actions.”Mr Dunlop said it was time for political change: “What Northern Ireland needs is a middle ground party that is unashamedly pro-Union — and no, that’s not the Alliance Party — that’s prepared to work without tribal affiliation for all our people.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Tens of thousands of people don’t bother to vote any longer and we have to ask why. They want something that is relevant and meaningful that meets their needs.“They couldn’t care less about a border poll or the colour of flags. They want to get on with their lives and do the best they can for their families. They want change, meaningful change that gives them the space to be whatever they want to be within the Union.”Mr Dunlop quit the party last October claiming that locally it was “run more like a supper club than a properly organised political machine”.He accused the Tories nationally of failing to enthusiastically back the operation here because the leadership didn’t want to upset the political status quo.A fortnight ago, selected Conservative candidate Gary Hynds resigned over his party’s stance on the Irish Sea border. He is now contesting Lagan Valley as an independent.The Lisburn-based businessman claimed the protocol had “done more to edge Northern Ireland out of the Union than  years of republican terrorism”.Mr Hynds said: “Northern Ireland Conservatives are schizophrenic on what is a fundamental point. Some seem to think you can half oppose and half support it, depending on which constituency you find yourself in.“They are asking the electorate to buy into a dangerous mixed message. The damage the protocol is doing has to be recognised.“It has undermined Northern Ireland’s place within the Union and needs to be jettisoned.“The party locally doesn’t see it that way and thinks it can play politics with something that strikes at the very heart of our Britishness.“The Conservatives are a beaten docket here. They have no credibility and, in my view, are beyond the point of recovery.

Now I’m hitting nearly k and it is mental.”Around five years ago, Zara started rearing her own flock of Beltex sheep, which according to the Beltex Sheep Society, “is a terminal sire breed which is sought after for its double-muscle and the hindquarters which are its outstanding feature”.She does this with the help of her nine-year-old sister Leah, and in , she won the overall prize for butchers’ lambs at the Ulster Beef and Lamb Championships, which led to UTV asking her and her family to star in their hit farming series, Rare Breed.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It [sheep farming] was just sort of a way of le.

It’s not easy with lambing and everything, but we get there!”The -year-old added that TikTok has been a great way to highlight the benefits of farming to a new audience, and brands such as luxury British country clothing store Fairfax  Favor have even asked Zara to collaborate to promote their products on her TikTok page. “When I go out, people look to get photos with me and I’ve actually had a farm in New Zealand contacting me about bloodlines within the sheep.“They would like to go down our bloodlines because they’ve seen me on TikTok!”Most ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilLatest Northern IrelandSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claimsFormer PO employee sues company for unfair dismissal and discriminationLocal Tories ‘on brink of extinction’ as party fields a single runnerArmagh athlete Eoin Duffy fights ban on competing as a paralympianSmash Hits magazine back after  years with a one-off special to mark theof Derry GirlsLatestExhibition celebrating British pop culture to launch in ManchesterRussia launches new attacks as investigators gather evidence of ‘war crimes’Rapper Tory Lanez jailed again in Megan Thee Stallion shooting caseFootball rumours: PSG make offer to Manchester United’s Paul PogbaFundraiser and D-Day hero Harry dies aged ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These figures will allow residents to judge town hall bosses for themselves and hold their local councils to account,” he said.All  NI councils were asked to comment on the report. A BCC spokesperson said the salaries for the chief executives of the councils were set independently during local government reforms in  and the salary takes into account the fact that the council is the largest.“It is also benchmarked against other comparable posts in the public sector. The salaries of directors in Belfast City Council were also set after an independent evaluation of the job roles and the scale of the s the directors are responsible for in a city authority,” the spokesperson added.Antrim and Newtownabbey also said salaries are in line with the salary banding agreed for local government here.Derry City and Strabane District Council said its chief executive’s pay is in line with the appropriate local government salary scale for the post.Ards and North Down Borough Council added: “[Salaries] are benchmarked against other comparable public sector posts and are proportionately lower than in England, Scotland and Wales.’Causeway Coast and Glen Borough Council said: “Council senior officer salaries are set at a national level in England, therefore the council has little influence on these rates of pay.”Related topicsBelfast City CouncilDerry City and Strabane District CouncilMid and East Antrim Borough CouncilCauseway Coast and Glens Borough CouncilLisburn and Castlereagh City CouncilNewry, Mourne and Down District CouncilAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough CouncilArds and North Down Borough CouncilFermanagh and Omagh District CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilBelfast City Council looking to establish Poverty Commission amid cost of living crisisOverflowing bins leading to ‘health crisis’ for residents in HolylandBelfast to hold annual Troubles reflection day on June Ulster Unionist Dr John Kyle in call for Belfast to become a ‘City of Sanctuary’ for refugees and asylum seekersBelfast City Council to host ‘Day of Reflection’ to acknowledge pain and hurt caused by the TroublesMost ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilLatest Northern IrelandNI teenager Zara Preston promotes farming to a new generation on TikTokDevice discovered during Belfast security alertSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claimsFormer PO employee sues company for unfair dismissal and discriminationLocal Tories ‘on brink of extinction’ as party fields a single runnerLatestNI teenager Zara Preston promotes farming to a new generation on TikTokDevice discovered during Belfast security alertExhibition celebrating British pop culture to launch in ManchesterRussia launches new attacks as investigators gather evidence of ‘war crimes’Rapper Tory Lanez jailed again in Megan Thee Stallion shooting case,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Mark CondrenPól Ó ConghaileApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDublin Airport says the queuing issues that have plagued travellers in recent days improved last weekend, but it has now advised passengers to arrive three and-a-half hours before flights.If parking a car, allow a further  minutes,” the airport says. That means travellers flying even short-haul journeys at peak times, such as the early morning rush hour period, weekends or over the Easter holidays, may have to plan on arriving up to four hours before departure.“The weekend just gone saw a much-improved situation in terms of security times in both terminals at Dublin Airport,” Graeme McQueen, Media Relations Manager with the DAA, told Independent.ie. “While passenger numbers over the weekend were up on the previous weekend, the time it took passengers to get through security was manageable, with a maximum time of around  minutes in T on both Saturday and Sunday, and around  minutes in T on both days.”This was aided by the rollout of a staff taskforce, the airport says, “which is seeing all DAA staff picking up shts in customer-facing roles within the terminals”.This all-hands-to-pump approach is seeing staff fulfil tasks such as queue management, the giving out of general customer service advice, tray replacement at security and much more.”Read MoreDublin Airport:  tips for tackling the security queues – from ‘evening before’ check-in to a ‘VIP terminal’Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Live security times have also been ed to its dublinairport website, and will follow on the app in an update later this week, it says. It follows a period of y security delays for passengers in both terminals, caused by a shortage of security staff, Covid-related absences and a rebound in travel that has exceeded DAA expectations y pc, or , passengers a day, according to CEO Dalton Philips.The results have seen queues lasting hours in some cases, with some passengers reporting missed flights. The airport has also temporarily suspended its Fast Track system, and says demand for car parks is “very high and “likely to sell out” on certain days. A perfect storm,” Mr Philips has called it.Staff have been working in stressful conditions. One passenger spat in the face of a security staff member and was arrested, The Sunday Independent reported. Lots of businesses are experiencing hiring issues and Covid-related shortages, and UK airports like Heathrow and Manchester experienced similar delays this weekend, while easyJet was forced to cancel over  flights on foot of staffing issues.However, Dublin Airport’s contracts – which only guarantees a -hour week and € wage for new security hires – have also been cited as a factor, as has its failure to predict passenger numbers when it had clear sight of recently introduced summer schedules.Previously, Dublin Airport’s rule of thumb was to advise passengers to arrive two hours before short-haul flights, and three hours before long-haul departures. As air travel picks up and the Easter holidays approach, however, the airport is only going to get busier. April  is expected to be “peak day” of the Easter period. Ryanair has begun to roll out what it says is its largest ever summer schedule for Dublin this year, while Aer Lingus is ramping up its transatlantic routes. This Thursday, its flights to Philadelphia resume, for example, with a second flight to Chicago taking off from April . It is really important that passengers using Dublin Airport continue to heed our advice to arrive at the airport a minimum of . hours prior to their flight,” McQueen says.Ryanair has also advised passengers to arrive . hours before flights, and last week called on the Government to draft in  army personnel to help deal with the security delays. The Department of Transport says it has established a daily crisis management meeting to tackle the issue.The DAA has put several additional measures in place to try and alleviate the situation, from stepping up a recruitment drive to add some  security staff to its existing team of , to introducing additional overtime and redeploying staff to support queue management and customer service.This week, it will carry out over  interviews with prospective candidates and says it will add new hires to the frontline “as soon as possible”.Vetting and training typically takes five to six weeks, however.As demand for travel picks back up, and countries continue to ease Covid-related travel restrictions, the airport now estimates that passenger numbers in the summer “are likely to reach around pc of  levels”.Pre-pandemic, that was a record year – it welcomed  million passengers.Most ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilLatest Republic of IrelandFormer PO employee sues company for unfair dismissal and discriminationZelensky to make historic address to Irish ParliamentDublin Airport:  tips for tackling the security queues – from ‘evening before’ check-in to a ‘VIP terminal’Russian plea for help as Irish embassy faces fuel shortageIrish government ‘keeping open mind’ on further expulsions of Russian officialsLatestRapper Tory Lanez jailed again in Megan Thee Stallion shooting caseFootball rumours: PSG make offer to Manchester United’s Paul PogbaFundraiser and D-Day hero Harry dies aged Rosalind SkillenOpinionFashion must not become something that costs the earthSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claims,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I hope all of my children will, in time, become young farmers, get their Green Certs and we’ll be able to pass them on a reasonable quantity of land, whether they want to farm it or not at that stage. It will be up to them.”Both his grandparents and parents farmed and some of his young family are showing an interest.As for inheriting the land, he says he’s a “firm believer in Warren Buffett’s maxim – you should leave your children enough so they can do anything, but not enough that they can do nothing”.“But we are determined that the kids are not going to inherit a bundle of money. But I would like them to think thatwe’re in the fortunate position that we would be able to pass them on a nice house and they could inherit a farm of land and then they can decide what they want to do with it or not.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up His eldest son is studying Ag Science at school, something O’Leary says he’s “extremely proud” of.As to whether or not he would encourage them to go into farming, he says he would like them all to go to college and get a third-level qualication.“And then I would like them to at least have the option of going into farmingthey want or follow [another] professional career. I wouldn’t want to prejudge what they do. But I would certainly like... when I die, they would all inherit or get  acres of land or  acres of land and then they can decide what to do with it. They can set it, they can sell it or they can work it themselves.”Mr O’Leary’s current contract with Ryanair will expire in , but the group CEOsays he has no plans to step down.“No, I’ve no intention of retiring. I’m sure I’ll be having a discussion with the board over whether they want me to continue on for another contract. And as long as we can agree on reasonable payment terms, I’d be very happy to work on here for another couple of years,” he says.Askedhe will ever retire, he replies: “I hope not. I wouldn’t want to retire.“I don’t fancy myself retiring. We’re building a new management team in Ryanair... so we have very good managers coming along underneath me. I will probably not work as hard in Ryanair in the next five or  years as I’ve done in the last  years, but it will hopefully need less of my time anyway.”Despite rising inflation, he says people can still afford to fly “with Ryanair, because we’ve got the lowest airfare”, but he acknowledges that airfares are set to rise.“What we’re seeing at the moment is prices are slightly lower than they were in , pre-Covid, through March, April and May. They’re somewhere between pc and pc higher at the moment through June, July, August and September. I think they’re going to be higher priced in peak summer months this year for a couple of reasons.“Asia is still essentially closed and the Asians are not travelling to Europe. So more and more people are going to be holidaying on the beaches of Spain and Portugal, Italy and Greece this summer. So there’s more demand and probably pc fewer seats and that’s going to result in forward bookings being stronger and fares being slightly higher.“I think fares will be up this year in the peak summer months by between pc and pc. They’re not going to go pc or pc. And partly, that’s because we’re adding another  aircraft this year.“So we’re adding another  million seats into the market. So partly, we’ll keep prices down by growing so strongly.”And while the era of cheap flights is not over, he warns there are threats ahead.“Our tourism industry is also heavily dependent upon having low-cost air access in from Europe, so we can bring the Germans and the Italians and the French and the Spanish here.“Our Government needs to fight against environmental taxes because environmental taxes will be very damaging for peripheral countries.”Most ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilLatest Republic of IrelandFormer PO employee sues company for unfair dismissal and discriminationZelensky to make historic address to Irish ParliamentDublin Airport:  tips for tackling the security queues – from ‘evening before’ check-in to a ‘VIP terminal’Russian plea for help as Irish embassy faces fuel shortageIrish government ‘keeping open mind’ on further expulsions of Russian officialsLatestRapper Tory Lanez jailed again in Megan Thee Stallion shooting caseFootball rumours: PSG make offer to Manchester United’s Paul PogbaRosalind SkillenOpinionFashion must not become something that costs the earthSinn Fein running away from public statements on border poll, Donaldson claimsFundraiser and D-Day hero Harry dies aged ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them.

McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may,

going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

Parish Reader Lucy Cullen led the service alongside Bishop McClay. Father Ciaraacuten Dallat, Parish Priest of St Macartanrsquos, Loughinisland, read the gospel and representatives of other local churches were also present.The two mosaics feature an image of the Lamb of God atop the world and the dove of the Holy Spirit descending from heaven, both of whose halos contain  carat gold leaf covered by a thin hand blown layer of crystal.Artist Maeve King spoke of the atmosphere of serenity this project afforded as she worked on the pieces during the pandemic.The service also featured the premier of a short setting of the Angus Dei composed by Maeve Kingrsquos cousin, Jason McKinstry, and inspired by her mosaics. Mathew Forde, from Seaforde, wrote a potted history of the parish for inclusion in the order of service and read a lesson.Speaking after the service, the Rev Adrian Dorrian, Vicar of LAMP with responsibility for Seaforde, said: ldquoIt is a true blessing, after over two years of delayed plans, to have been able to come together to celebrate three centuries of worship in the Church here in Seaforde, although Loughinisland Parish has an even longer history.ldquoWe were able to look back with thanksgiving mdash some of the communion plate used during the service dates from its opening  years ago mdash and look forward with hope and confidence by dedicating these stunning mosaics to the glory of God and pray that they will bless people in future generations.Mr Dorrian added: ldquoAcross over  years of Godrsquos people worshipping in this place, and especially during the past two years of pandemic, he has been faithful.

A hereditary head of state is a peculiar form of hierarchy that few new states would choose to adopt. Butyou have a successful existing such system, as Britain does, then it can work very well.The throne then passes from one monarch to his or her heir on death, and so on, indefinitely.The Prince of Wales can be a controversial and political figure but few people would dispute that he has demonstrated keen awareness of the duty that comes with being a king-in-waiting. Prince Charles is now in his early s, but shows the sort of energy levels that his own parents did past retirement age, as evident in his recent visit to Northern Ireland. He has been next in line to the throne for  years and has more than proven his suitability for that role.The Prince of Wales has good reason to be proud of his own heir, William, but the conscientious younger prince’s time will come, and there is no need to hasten it.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe owner of Coaltown Coffee was still just a teenager when he started up his business – then called Roasted Joe’s – in  after leaving secondary school with no qualications.Nearly a decade after dad Gordon helped him build his first roaster, Coaltown’s products are being savoured around the world and the company is continuing to go from strength to strength.With the support of Gordon and mum Jennine, Scott has made a big mark on his hometown of Ammanford, with their Foundry Road roastery popular among locals and those from further afield.Given that his parents used to run their own café and older generations of the family were grocers and restaurateurs, it is perhaps no surprise that the coffee industry has been Scott’s calling.Great-grandfather Ben, a miner in the former coal town, inspired the rebranding of the company, and Scott hasn’t looked back since ditching the Roasted Joe’s name.“The mining industry was a big part of everyday le in this area and that’s gone, it’s been completely wiped out,” he told the Welsh Business Heroes webinar.“It was really impactful, and the idea of that industry that’s no longer here was very much the inspiration behind what we wanted to do with the brand, which is where the name came from.“We were doing some research into the mining industry and one of the terms for what they called coal was ‘black gold’.“Coal gave a massive amount of employment and industry to the area, and, when you look at coffee, black gold is the same term used for coffee growing regions.“They are two very dferent worlds but are tied together through black gold.”In , Coaltown became one of the first coffee companies in the UK to be B Corp certied, meaning they are committed to prioritising the environment and society in how they do business..removeAnd that ethical approach to doing things has, according to Scott, always been at the forefront of his mind as an entrepreneur.“We went on a trip to New York to see my favourite roasteries,” he said.“I can’t stress enough how massively influential that trip was. You really do need to go somewhere and soak it all in because it just inspires you and makes you have a completely dferent approach to what you do.“That’s where I first encountered Square as a brand before they opened in the UK, and it was also where I first encountered B Corp.“It’s a universally adopted accreditation which allows you to implement a lot of sustainability ethics into one brand.“B Corp is a really good thing for giving you a general overview of everything you do as a business.“What B Corp means is that you are putting your planet before profit and your business as a force for good and change before anything .“I don’t think any business opening as a fresh start-up today can open without that in mind. It’s not a tradable landscape for you to be able to grow within.“You have to have that ethical approach to everything you do.“B Corp, as a brand, really summed up everything we were as a business “We were awarded that in December  and announced it in late January , and we were the first specialty roastery in UK to get it so we were very proud of that.“It was a big feat because we were up against some really big players in the UK.“We all have the ambition to be ethical and do the best we can, but to get that certication first was a really big thing for us.“It’s looking at how you run your business from the ground up.“As a brand, we’ve been purpose driven, so it’s about how we can bring a new industry to our hometown, and now post-industrial towns across the UK.“It has always been our intention to have an ethical brand.“Essentially, the coal industry is the opposite of what we are, we’re trying to be the opposite of what the coal industry was with fossil fuels and bad carbon.”Watch the Welsh Business Heroes episode featuring Scott James of Coaltown Coffee in its entirety here - www.youtube watch vKZFsjhVei article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe former Porto star, signed in January, was booed relentlessly but he responded perfectly in the th minute to spare the blushes of Ibrahima Konate, whose mistake just over half an hour after scoring his first goal for the club had gted the hosts a goal they had barely deserved.Jurgen Klopp’s side had been coasting at half-time in the Estadio da Luz after Sadio Mane’s goal doubled the advantage given to them by their centre-back’s header but having squandered numerous chances, Konate’s legs got tangled as he tried to make a clearance early in the second half and Darwin Nunez capitalised.Luis Díaz. That is all. 🙌 pic DrxwpfqNO— Liverpool FCApril , It was a goal which signicantly changed the game for a long period, as Benfica suddenly looked the better side with Liverpool completely out of sorts, but Diaz had the final word to make thelook slightly more comfortable than it had done.Victory saw Liverpool, who had lost on their last three visits here, equal a club record of five successive away victories in Europe.The omens had not been great for Benfica, third in Portugal’s Primeira Liga  points behind leaders Porto – whom Liverpool had hammered - and - in the group stages this season.Of the six changes Klopp made, the best one was bringing right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold in after almost three weeks out with a hamstring injury.His pass for Diaz to head into Mane’s path for the second goal was a thing of wonder, while the one he delivered for a strangely off-colour Mohamed Salah to race onto but shoot straight at goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos was almost as good.It was the first time Klopp had started the midfield trio of Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Naby Keita, with the latter impressing in attacking areas..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Naby Keita, left, impressed against Benfica In the opening  minutes the midfielder almost operated as a fourth forward, joining the attack to have four shots of his own before the break to underline the visitors’ dominance.That they only had a two-goal lead to their name was nothing short of criminal considering the opportunities which fell to Keita, Diaz, Salah – three times – and Alexander-Arnold.Konate eventually made the crucial th-minute breakthrough when Diaz won a corner which Andy Robertson swung to the far post, where the defender easily out-jumped Everton to beat the goalkeeper with a downward header.But better was still to come as Alexander-Arnold’s crossfield ball was laid on a plate for Diaz to nod into Mane’s path and the Senegal international could not miss from close range, going past Steven Gerrard’s total of  Champions League goals. vw,vw,px, px\"Sadio Mane, right, scores Liverpool’s second goal Half-time brought another club record as Liverpool went  matches without conceding a first-half goal, although they had barely been troubled with Everton coming closest with a shot into the side-netting.Four minutes into the second half that all changed after Konate’s calamity trying to deal with Rafa Silva’s low cross.The goal altered the mood in the stadium and the momentum on the pitch and Klopp’s triple change of Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota and Jordan Henderson for Mane, Salah and Thiago attempted to restore control.🎼 \"EU AMO O BENFICA, LA LA LA…\" ❤🤍#EPluribusUnum #SLBLIV #UCL pic JBaHoEQlu— SL BenficaApril , Further Konate misjudgements caused more problems with Alisson Becker first having to parry Everton’s low shot and then, after the defender went chasing a ball he could never win, Nunez had a penalty claim rejected after tumbling under Virgil Van Dijk’s challenge.The pressure seemed to be getting to even the best, with Van Dijk’s air-kick in the centre-circle a brief moment of concern while Alisson also duffed a couple of clearances.But just when it looked like frustration would get the better of them, Keita’s perfect through-ball allowed Diaz to round the goalkeeper and slot home an angled shot.On the last two occasions the teams met in the quarter-finals of this competition, in  and , Liverpool went on to lt the trophy and Diaz’s goal put them well on their way to the last four this time..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Liverpool take - first-leg lead over Benfica after late Luis Diaz strike article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Good teams tend to use that.“The game was slightly more open then we wished but in the end we scored and I think everyone in the room would agree we could have scored more goals and should have.“We would have wished we didn’t give them the opportunity to come back in the game.“It was an away game in the Champions League quarter-final andthat was easy something would be wrong with the competition.” vw,vw,px, px\"Benfica fans created an intense atmosphere in Lisbon Victory equalled a club record of five successive away wins in the competition first set in , but also matched in  when the club played three Champions League qualiers..removeHowever, Klopp will not take theleg for granted as his side’s quest for an unprecedented quadruple took another step forward.“We were two goals up at half-time today and we knew it was not easy,” he added.“Benfica really wanted to go for it.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe British Pop Archive, created at the The John Rylands Research Institute and Library at the University of Manchester, aims to celebrate and preserve British popular music and other aspects of popular culture, including UK television, youth culture and counter-culture from the mid-th century to the present day.The collection will initially focus on Manchester and the British pop culture to have come out of the city.The archive will include Joy Division and New Order’s manager Rob Gretton’s original written vision for the band and Ian Curtis’s handwritten lyrics to Joy Division classics such as She’s Lost Control and Atmosphere.. vw,vw,px, px\"Handwritten lyrics to She’s Lost Control, by Ian Curtis, c It also features original posters for Sex Pistols gigs at The Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester and important works by designer Peter Saville that set the visual template for Factory Records.The complete corporate archive of Granada Television is also included.The archive’s creator, Hannah Barker, told the PA news agency: “British popular culture is unique. It’s one of our biggest cultural exports.”She added: “People outside of Britain,you talk to them about pop music or the music they like, they will often talk about British music.“And in terms of TV and film too, I think we have unique stories to tell there.“British TV is famous throughout the world so it’s that sense of the importance of British popular culture as a particularly unique export.Mat Bancroft, curator of the British Pop Archive, said: “We launch the British Pop Archive with a Manchester-focused exhibition full of unique and unseen artefacts. These materials tell the story of a vibrant city with art, culture and music at its heart.”The exhibition will explore elements of the highly recognisable Manchester pop scene with items relating to The Hacienda nightclub, the Factory Records record label, and some of the city’s most memorable bands including Joy Division and The Smiths..remove vw,vw,px, px\"From Manchester With Love poster designed in  “We even have a pair of trainers in one of the archives,” said Ms Barker.She added: “It’s in Kevin Cumming’s archive – he’s a rock photographer and he has a pair of Hacienda trainers, unworn, in the original box.”The archive will subsequently be expanded to become a national collection, and create a comprehensive representation of British popular culture.Ms Barker credited the idea for the project to the death of Buzzcocks singer Pete Shelley and The Fall vocalist Mark E Smith, and wondering whether the musicians had archives and what would become of them.As part of the creation of the archive, conversations were had with iniduals who were heavily involved in development of the British pop culture scene during the s and ’s including The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr.Ms Barker told PA: “One of our biggest supporters is Johnny Marr, so I got to meet him and talk about the project and I got to talk to other people and the family members of people involved.”She added: “People are often really keen to ensure that that things stay in public hands, because a lot of this stuff is the sort of thing that could easily be sold on auction sites.“So it’s great to be able to keep records of businesses or inidual lives publicly available.”– Collection, launching the British Pop Archive will run from May  until January   at the John Rylands Research Institute and Library at the University of Manchester."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/community_news/resources/images/13647463.jpg","title":"community news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Their creative and inspirational designs will help create a good first impression among international visitors coming to the area to experience the Game of Thrones Studio Tour.“I am looking forward to seeing further regeneration work get underway in Banbridge as part of our Arrivals Project - all of which will create a high quality environment and support the town’s long-term economic and social prosperity.” Irish-Singaporean illustrator and muralist Holly Pereira was inspired by the area’s unique connection to the Brontë family. Her hand-painted ‘Welcome to Banbridge’ mural in Newry Street celebrates the Brontë link to the area using typography inspired by the world’s most famous literary family.Artist Friz pays homage to the town’s most famous landmark and Europe’s first ever flyover, Downshire Bridge. The mural of Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton at Bridge Street. Picture: Edward Byrne PhotographyHer mural in Downshire Place depicts an old woman who used to sell apples on the bridge and jingle the money in her pocket, giving it the affectionate local nickname Jingler’s Bridge. Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"proposal to use dunluce centre sale proceeds for parker avenue pitch upgrade ","story":"Boystabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan   Murder suspect arrested after PSNI stop car on dual-carriagewayNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPoliticsCouncilProposal to use Dunluce Centre sale proceeds for Parker Avenue pitch upgradeA Portrush youth football team are hoping that the sale of the Dunluce Centre will help their calls for upgraded facilities at their pitch.By Una CulkinThursday, st March , : am  \"       \"  Cllr John McAuleyPortrush Youths FC said they were forced to halt training in February of this year due to the condition of playing facilities at the Council-run Parker Avenue site.Speaking at the time, club Chairman Jason Quigley compared the pitch to a ‘swamp’ and added: “We face the same issue every winter and nothing is ever done about it and we are paying for the privilege of playing on this.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by. Choice also manage a Financial Inclusion programme, through which they are supporting tenants to improve their money management, ensuring they can maximise their income. In the last year this programme helped tenants access pound. million in financial gains, and specialised staff at Choice are continuing to help tenants with benefits, debt, and budgeting advice.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abfdcfbefdbfc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cddafdacfcefba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649166321462.jpg--ulster_fry_index_at_its_highest_since_2014.jpg?164916632200","title":"ulster fry index at its highest since  ","story":"Farmers and consumers alike can expect food, fuel, and energy prices to increase as a new cost of living crisis continues to put pressure on Northern Ireland households. The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.
