The pair met and became friends through the Royal Berkshire Polo ClubOf Charles, with whom she\u0027s played polo at the Royal Berkshire club on several occasions over the years, Powers said: \u0027I think he\u0027s a much undermined and maligned person. He is a very knowledgeable man about many, many areas. \u0027He\u0027s very concerned about the environment and about architecture. He feels strongly about things that he is obliged not to say anything about because of his public position. \u0027I think he deserves a great more deal more credit than he is given. He\u0027s lovely, witty. \u0027I think the general impression, because of Diana, was thumbs down for him and thumbs up for her. \u0027That\u0027s what the public does—makes black and white judgments without knowing anything. The public doesn\u0027t know who he is.She concluded: \u0027He will make a good king, I think, in spite of the fact he probably doesn\u0027t want it—who knows? He has very big shoes to fill.

The actor, now 89, was named a person of interest in Wood\u0027s death in February 2018.  Asked whether she thinks Wagner is innocent, Powers said: \u0027I won\u0027t comment about that. \u0027I won\u0027t even bring it up as an issue. It doesn’t bear discussion. It is a non-issue. \u0027What happened happened, and the rehashing of it is generally done by people who wish to get some money from it.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Apprentice star Lottie Lion 20 claims infamous Gandhi text taken context","story":"Share this article A spokesperson from The Apprentice says: ‘Every show is a fair and balanced representation of events.

It left finalists Carina and recruitment company owner Scarlett Allen Horton, 32, to battle it out for Lord Sugar’s £250,000 investment.Lottie was, at least, afforded a gracious exit. ‘It didn’t show this on-screen, but Lord Sugar told me that he felt I had taken part in the process five years too early and I think he was right,’ she says.Little chance of her going back for more, of course — those bridges are well and truly burned. Instead, she is trying to focus on moving forward with her business plan — and focusing on the positive. ‘Love it or loathe it, the Lottie Lion brand is pretty well known now,’ she says.Few could argue with that.

A whistleblower has told  Money that a “disastrous” management reorganisation has left the service in disarray, with the public waiting as long as two years to get justice.The whistleblower, a senior staff member at the FOS who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that:• Consumers sending complex complaints to FOS can wait 10 months before a file is even picked up and examined.• The waiting time for pension disputes is seven months.• Wronged consumers can wait up to two years until their claims are finally adjudicated.• The number of unresolved general claims (non-PPI) that remain unresolved a year after being received now stands at 15,551.• Managers expected case handlers to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, but the real figure is 1.7.Documents shown to Money by the whistleblower indicate that a consumer with a complex dispute with their mortgage company or home insurer faces a wait of about 10 months before the file is even picked up and looked for the first time.The service was set up to help consumers get fair treatment from the banks, insurers, pension and other financial services providers. Staff act as independent adjudicators over disputes, and their findings are binding on the companies concerned. It’s free for consumers to use, but the company concerned must pay £550.However, the service has been beset with problems in recent years. In 2018, an undercover reporter for Channel 4’s Dispatches found that staff with inadequate training or financial competence were judging cases – sometimes without, it claimed, properly reading case files.Several staff have since turned whistleblower in a bid to get the Financial Conduct Authority to take action. Their comments chime with complaints to Money from readers who, having been through the arbitration process, claim the service is not fit for purpose.According to the latest whistleblower, things are even worse now than a year ago. A 2016 reorganisation changed the way cases are distributed, he says. Instead of using expert adjudicators to deal solely with disputes in their specialist areas, new investigators were expected to work across all areas of finance. The result, he says, has been a huge drop in the service’s performance in what it calls its “general cases”, leaving a growing list of people awaiting what can be life-changing sums of money.Complaints are initially judged by an“investigator” and only escalated to the experienced ombudsmen if either party appeals against the first decision.The queue of complaints waiting for an ombudsman’s decision has increased dramatically in recent years and now stands at 15,592.“Managers believed their changes would enable investigators to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, which turned out to be a gross misjudgment. The system has never delivered more than 2.6 case closures per week and the current output is now 1.7,” he says.“The organisation is facing problems beyond simply the backlogs. The resolved complaints per investigator per week is less than half of what it was claimed would be achieved.And the cost of resolving each complaint now exceeds £1,100 – placing the long-term sustainability of the organisation in doubt.”The end of the tsunami of PPI claims that swamped the service was set to be an opportunity to start clearing the backlog in complaints. However, improved service times have not emerged, he says.“This year we intended to resolve 50,000 more complaints than we received – 510,000 versus 460,000 – to deal with the large backlog of cases which had developed, particularly in general casework as a result of the failed restructure. We have just learned that the target has been cut to 310,000.”The delays are particularly hard on those with buildings insurance complaints, including subsidence and high-value claims that are taking 10 months before anyone starts to look at the complaint.“The queue for an ombudsman’s decision is, if anything, worse than the queue at the front end of the process. In areas such as buildings insurance and pensions, complainants are now regularly having to wait over a year from the time they request an ombudsman’s decision. Putting the two queues together, it can be seen that if one were to complain today about, for example, a buildings insurance claim for subsidence, it is likely to be over two years before a decision is issued. The complainant just has to hope their house hasn’t fallen down in the meantime,” he says.A spokeswoman for the FOS said: “Last year an independent review of the Financial Ombudsman Service concluded that we provided an ‘effective and essential service’. We have come off the back of our busiest year for five years and are working to get people answers on their cases as quickly as possible. Our team work hard to make sure every complaint we handle is investigated thoroughly, to ensure we reach a fair result for people and businesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1c25340386445632106ddb6b69a8117666a1e7/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aabff8a1f67041a06fd1ba524a8033b6","title":"around the world in a day without leaving shenzhen a photo essay","story":"For Chinese tourists who cannot travel, the Window of the World theme park offers versions of 130 global attractions. Photojournalist Anthony Micallef took a whistlestop tour More than 3 million visitors a year flock to the Window of the World theme park in the megacity of Shenzhen to see 130 copies of the world’s largest tourist sites gathered in a single place.For Chinese tourists who may not be able to travel out of the country this is their only chance of seeing the New York skyline, the pyramids of Giza or the Taj Mahal – or smaller replicas of them, at least.The visit typically begins at the metro station, modelled in the shape of the Louvre pyramid in Paris, designed by Chinese-American architect IM Pei. Most tourists then head for the nearby splendours of European architecture: the Acropolis of Athens, the Palace of Versailles, Buckingham Palace and Tower Bridge from London, or Italy’s Leaning Tower of Pisa.Moving to Asia, the Angkor Wat temple is always popular with visitors. The Hindu temple complex in Cambodia is the largest religious monument in the world, although the copy here is somewhat smaller. Mount Fuji and the Iranian city of Persepolis are also packed with visitors. A few hundred metres further on, Sydney Opera House is a step or two from the sacred sandstone rock of Uluru.Next up is the Manhattan skyline, Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer statue, and the monumental stone figures of Easter Island – all without ever leaving Shenzhen.Many visitors buy a fake passport which the theme park hostesses will stamp with as many foreign visas as you want.The theme park also offers boat trips down the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, and a cable car ride across the Amazon rain forest. If you want to cool down there is a climate-controlled indoor ski centre with 4,000 sq m of artificial snow slopes.If you look closely, many of the reproductions appear a little kitsch and the decor outdated. Some visitors complain a few need a new paint job, or even a total rebuild.But putting aside aesthetic disappointments, the park does allow the visitor to learn a lot about the real sites and their histories. I emerge knowing that the Moscow Kremlin was first a residence of the tsars, then of the leaders of the USSR, and is nowadays the official residence of Russia’s President Putin.I learn that the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption of Pisa is located in Piazza dei Miracoli, which is a Unesco world heritage site that includes the famous leaning tower. Finally, we learn that the gate of Ishtar in Iraq was one of the eight gates of Babylon, built in 580BC on the orders of King Nebuchadnezzar II and dedicated to the goddess Ishtar.Many tourists at the Shenzhen park come from modest backgrounds. Some cannot afford international travel and others are forbidden to leave the country because their “citizen score” is too low. Often they are seeing representations of these monuments for the first time.The park is unrealistic to say the least: in truth the presidents on Mount Rushmore, for example, look out on to South Dakota, but at Window of the World they overlook Washington’s Capitol Building, some 1,600km away. The Shenzhen Eiffel Tower rises to a third of its real size (108m instead of 324m), but you can climb it and admire the view of the pyramids of Giza in Egypt.On the other hand, the park allows visitors an opening to a world that would otherwise be inaccessible and unknown to them.The ability to eat Mexican food while walking in the Cambodian temple of Angkor Wat is the novel offer of a park which slashes both distance and time. By the end of the visit, the landmarks are blurred: we toured the planet by jumping over continents and centuries.

Since 2014 she has been writing about the role of big data and commercial surveillance in the digital era. Last year she published her third book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, which became a bestseller and has been described by Zadie Smith as “easily the most important book to be published this century”.This is a powerful compilation of rap music featuring a range of amazing artists: people like Nas, Ghostface Killah, De La Soul. Many of the songs take aim at what I have called “surveillance capitalism” and its power to influence, degrade and control our feelings and behaviours. Many lyrics blaze with insight and the righteous outrage crucial to public awakening. The album names these hidden forces, assuring us that our sense of menace is not paranoia, but recognition of “our generation’s form of nuclear power”. As one rap counsels, “How we deal with this will be the stuff of history.”During a recent week in Paris we were dazzled by many beautiful dinners. But best of all was an afternoon roaming the Jewish Quarter in the Marais, where my son Jake and I collected golden crepes with butter and sugar and massive pittas stuffed with falafel. Sacha Finkelsztajn is a bright yellow-fronted delicatessen, and we laid out our treasures and ordered more: empanadas, pastrami, pastries filled with sweet poppy seed paste. Powered by mugs of hot coffee, we smiled, laughed, and ate joyously for an hour.This extraordinary exhibition of over 200 paintings, drawings and prints follows the journey of Dürer’s life and his otherworldly mastery. You can see his genius building as painstaking studies of hands, fingers, leaves, wings, flowers are reborn in large, complex compositions. There are some revered pieces, like Young Hare, and others rarely on display. The palpable force of his commitment to the world as it is, his uncanny insight and his breathtaking technical skill moved me deeply. The centuries that separate our existences seemed to melt away, leaving only the human struggle that we share.I find it impossible to live without the presence of trees: they focus me on what is most enduring. This Pulitzer-winning novel unfurls from the point of view of trees, creatures that grow stronger with age and die only when attacked from without – just the opposite of humans. Powers’s exquisite and soul-wrenching work is a tragic exploration of the wisdom and generosity of an Earth now doomed by modernity’s perverse refusal to embrace the non-human orders of life upon which everything depends, including now our very survival. This novel left me feeling sanctified, even as each page drove me mad.Earlier this year I saw a revival of this Lanford Wilson play about grief, how it undoes us and remakes us. Adam Driver plays a character whose younger brother is revealed to him only after his sudden death. Driver’s performance was Shakespearean: one of the most extraordinary experiences of theatre I’ve had. It reminded me that a single actor, on stage as in life, can have a transformational effect. Driver gave body and soul with an incandescent ferocity that taught me and changed me – something I didn’t anticipate and will never forget.I am moved by the seriousness with which Berlin memorialises the Holocaust, such as with Track 17 at Grunewald train station, where Jewish families were sent to their murder or the Wall of Mirrors, where ordinary people see only their own reflections. In Schöneberg, panels hang from lampposts displaying the edicts from 1933 onward that deprived Jewish people of their rights. A week later my children and I stood on Normandy’s Omaha Beach and wept for the young men who gave their lives to end such evil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_193_5232_3140/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba20842861e32d04c8de02f5a01e0d","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

Such terms are deliberately misleading, as are many claims.”That piece of commentary attracted the usual round of applause from pundits certain they knew better than climate scientists. Where once ignoring scientists and experts would result in a failing subject grade, in some sectors it’s now considered an “opt-in” belief.The following stories appeared over the same duration that News Corp publications were putting out articles (in the hundreds) about climate change, including warnings from scientists about the need for action, glaciers melting and criticisms of Australia’s policies.Bushfires blind alarmists in media to climate reality – the Australian, 24 NovemberHysterical efforts to blame the fires on climate change continue, even though we have always faced this threat and always will ... Tinder-dry conditions on the eastern seaboard this year are attributable to drought but as I have reported before, according to the head of the UNSW centre for climate extremes, Professor Andy Pitman, there is insufficient evidence to directly link the drought to climate change. Much media ignores the history of worse conditions and fires, and the lack of long-term rainfall trends, and runs hard on climate causal links.SA bushfires prove where warmist beliefs fall down – the Herald Sun, 25 November… True, the world has warmed slightly as it rebounds from the little ice age that stretched from 1300 to around 1870, but can we cool it on this panic?But, above all, can we drop our incredible arrogance in thinking man now has the power to change the climate? That just a few Australian politicians could do what we once believed would test even God?One-eyed ABC loses sight of wider, more erse picture of Australia – the Australian, 30 November… The ABC is, indeed, notorious for presenting only one side of the picture on many big issues, whether it be climate change, immigration, asylum-seekers, gay marriage, the Palestinians or the unspeakable Donald Trump … Have you ever heard an ABC interviewer stoutly cross-examine a refugee lawyer or put a climate change advocate through their paces?Therese Rein goes wild: Scott Morrison caused fires – the Herald Sun, 30 NovemberThis is nuts. Therese Rein, wife of Kevin Rudd, thinks prime minister Scott Morrison could have stopped fires in NSW by changing the world’s climate.Wow. That’s religion talking, not science.This global warming hysteria is totally off the dial.ABC reporters the real climate deniers – the Australian, 2 DecemberAndrew Bolt told his viewers on Tuesday night that he had again complained to the ABC about the latest Media Watch segment. If you follow Bolt’s many writings about climate it is obvious he does accept the temperature is rising. It has risen one degree since the start of the 20th century.But Bolt also reports scientists from other disciplines who question parts of the science. Many say climate models are not yet sophisticated enough to account for the effective regulation of atmospheric CO2 by the deep oceans, forests and soils. Bolt and others criticised by Media Watch often point to effects from solar activity. Many writers, like many climate scientists, say CO2 is not the most important greenhouse gas, pointing to water vapour and methane. These are all facts.Greta Thunberg’s invincible ignorance has infected our smartest – the Herald Sun, 8 DecemberThe science is clear: Morrison can do nothing to change the world’s climate and stop fires. Australia is just too small to make a difference.Is there any point in also showing that the fires aren’t caused by global warming, and that a recent Nasa study shows fires are now burning less land, not more?No, facts have lost their power ever since postmodernism conquered our universities and reassured the stupid they were mere social constructs. Even conspiracies.To mention facts now is no longer to bring light into darkness, but to set fire to your reputation.Logic Crimes of the New York Times – the Daily , 9 DecemberFormerly a newspaper of record, the New York Times has in recent decades has become a newspaper of leftist causes. Name any fashionable political trend and the New York Times is all over it.Climate change is of particular interest to the Times, which in 2014 ran this headline: ‘The End of Snow?’But five years later the same paper reported: ‘A powerful winter storm socked much of Montana with a wave of heavy snowfall on Sunday, with weekend totals climbing to 40 inches in some places, and breaking century-long daily records.’Unable to get things right in the US, the Times now turns to NSW and our bushfires.‘In some countries, such widespread environmental effects have led to changes in policy,’ the Times notes.‘In Australia, however – where the air in Sydney was ranked among the worst in the world last month – prime minister Scott Morrison has resisted.’What is he meant to do? Pass a law against bushfire smoke?Turnbull and Q\u0026ampA deceive viewers again on climate – the Herald Sun, 10 DecemberTony Jones in his final Q\u0026ampA as full-time host produces yet another anti-Liberal pack-attack, with nobody on the panel challenging Malcolm Turnbull’s wild global warming falsehoods:‘We have to recognise we have a hotter and drier climate. That’s the consequence of global warming. That will mean more fires and hotter fires.’Fact: this drought is not caused by global warming.Fact: fires around the world now burn less area.And the twist is that Turnbull, having just misled people so badly on the science, promptly accuses his critics instead of not following the facts:‘On the right, they are treating what should be a question of physics and science and economics and engineering as though it were an issue of religion and belief. And it’s nuts.’When it comes to global warming, it seems it’s now virtuous to tell untruths and evil to counter them with facts. And the ABC is on the side of untruth.Jane Fonda leads the world into the grip of anti-human hysteria over climate change – the Daily , 10 DecemberEnvironmental extremists like Fonda also refuse to acknowledge that the science of climate change is far from settled. In the scientific world the links between climate change and man-made fossil fuels is far from unanimous.Not only do many scientists argue carbon is an essential part of the atmosphere ensuring plant growth but they also argue such is the complexity involved in analysing cause and effect that it is simplistic and wrong to only focus on one cause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96545f22217ecf75ceb2365071b9e42d35791374/0_114_3432_2059/master/3432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc1699e14c0e7800095bbe5f40d2aec","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, from an illuminated giraffe to an elusive southern elephant seal"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/517fc1e9b07995a1d827c1ea43fbd41ad3df464d/1040_286_5945_3567/master/5945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cbc4e03a423ad5a3d1787fe86038c57","title":"puffer jackets green credentials","story":"The padded jacket is now as ubiquitous on high streets as cracked pavement slabs and Greggs. Billed as an effective way to stay in your duvet all day, it is, however, less forgiving when it comes to its ethical credentials. Many puffers are made from petroleum-based fabrics and filled with duck and goose down from dubious sources.But alternatives are now appearing. One option for the outer shell is recycled polyester, which is used in jackets by EcoAlf and Katherine Hamnett. New York-based Colovos has made a jacket from water-resistant merino wool, and Gap uses discarded plastic bottles. Moncler last week launched a down jacket made from plant-based fabrics, and Pangaia features a jacket made with dried wildflowers and a biopolymer.North Face and Patagonia prohibit force feeding and live plucking of birds. Recycled down such as Re:Down, as used by Everlane and Arket, consists of “down and feathers extracted from post-consumer goods”.Wilby said that the environmental damage caused by the polyester outer layer of padded jackets was also underestimated by consumers.

Perfect for hangovers.” It looks like a substantial plateful for £7, perfectly engineered for a surfeit of booze: chicken or beef sausages, eggs, ackee and saltfish, fried dumpling, plantain and beans. “But get here too late in the morning and you’d never find a table,” he says.That’s not a problem these days, not now he’s traded Michael for Stormzy. He may have moved from South Norwood to leafy Kingston in southwest London. He may be the most famous former pupil of Stanley Tech, a man who has played the world’s biggest stages. But he still returns to Bluejay to eat. There’s a table reserved for us, up against a wall plastered with photographs of their regulars, of which he is one. So no, not a standard review. They knew both of us were coming. Instead it’s a snapshot of a particular slice of south London culture the culture which made him.Joy and Dave Blake, both of whose families are Jamaican, opened Bluejay Café in 2008. Places like this are familiar to me I’ve lived a couple of miles up the road in Brixton for almost 30 years, which has its own version, their windows steamed, the air crackling with easy chatter. They’re much more than just restaurants. They are a focus for community a way of reasserting cultural identity, one heaving plateful of the familiar at a time. Rarely do they shout about themselves. They don’t need to because their customers know exactly where they are. They are an extension of the domestic, which means they can be unfairly overlooked and underestimated. The other customers here at Bluejay today are almost entirely black British, though you make assumptions about where their families are from, at your peril.“South London communities are seriously complicated,” Stormzy says. “I’m very Ghanaian, very West African.” At home his mum cooked jollof rice and okra stew and peanut soup. “As a kid I don’t ever remember eating vegetables. It was always big carbs – rice or yam or fufu – and then a stew.” But the Jamaican food here at Bluejay roots him, too. “If you’re African around here you know so much about Jamaican culture, and if you’re Jamaican you know so much about African culture.”He orders us both a fizzing glass of Mighty Malt. It is dark, and batters you around the head with huge caramel flavours. It’s like cola, in knuckle dusters. I admit that, despite three decades living around here, I’ve never before had one. “It’s an acquired taste,” he says. “And, you know, good after a heavy night out.” I leave him in charge of over-ordering. We start with golden fingers of salt fish fritter, both crisp and soft, sliced up into batons to be eaten with our hands.I ask him about food on tour. “Back in the early days,” he says, “it was a shit-show. Come off stage at 11pm and go for a McDonald’s. Get up the next morning and have a fry-up.” Eventually he concluded it was slowing him down for his full-on performance. “During my 2017 tour we had catering. We looked after ourselves.” And then there was the diet he went on ahead of his headline spot at this year’s Glastonbury. “It was 12 weeks, working with a nutritionist and a trainer. A lot of fish. There was mackerel and spinach in the morning, then I’d carb up until 5pm, then just protein and vegetables. It was gruelling. I was hungry all the time.” I ask if that was how he came to be so ripped when he performed with his top off at Glastonbury? He grins. “Yeah, that was it.” I tell him I’m relieved that I thought he was just built like that.Joy starts delivering the food. First up a bowl of glossy oxtail stew, in a deep sauce made rich from the melting gelatine, after many, many hours of heat and care. It is sweet and salty and rich and sustaining on an afternoon with more than a hint of winter about it. You tug at the meat with knife and fork and then set about the bones with your hands. There’s also a bowl of curry goat (never goat curry). It is an earthy yellow, presumably from turmeric, and has a powerful kick of allspice and Scotch bonnet. “Don’t drop that down your shirt,” Stormzy says, as if he’s my mum. “You’ll never get the stain out.” These are the ingredients others might leave behind, pushed firmly to the centre of the stage. Naturally enough there is rice and peas.He also orders a bowl of jerk chicken broken into penne pasta. It feels like a nostalgic act, a reminder of the younger man in search of food to soak up the excesses of the night before. It’s not a subtle bowlful, under its overcoat of waxy melted cheese, but it’s easy to see how it would do the job. I get a single piece of jerk chicken, which comes sauced and properly grilled. Each summer the Lambeth Country Show is held in Brockwell Park just to the south of Brixton. It’s a cross between a classic country show, with flower-arranging tents and sheep shearing demonstrations, and a Caribbean festival. A haze of grill smoke settles across the fields from the many brilliant jerk stands. The jerk chicken here is a reminder of that.To finish we have apple crumble. Would we like custard with that? Yes, we would. What’s the point of crumble without custard? I wonder aloud whether they take credit cards here. Stormzy turns to one of his mates, who arrived with him and is sitting at another table. “Do they?” His friend says no. “But there’s a cashpoint over there,” he says, pointing across the road to the post office. After a full-on night out, they always needed to know where the nearest cashpoint is.Our lunch is done. We’ve run up a bill of £32, but only by over-ordering. Stormzy works his way around the room, leaning his enormously tall frame into eager groups, some of whom he knows, some of whom he doesn’t. Selfies are snapped, friends embraced. Joy takes a kiss on each cheek. And then he’s gone. The car? It’s a Lamborghini SUV, since you asked. Well of course it is.Half Jamaican chef James Cochrane, who has worked at both the Ledbury and Harwood Arms, pulls irreverently on that heritage at his restaurant 1251 in London’s Islington. Try his buttermilk jerk spiced chicken with Scotch bonnet jam or the slow braised kid goat belly with radish and tarragon. Alongside the Caribbean influences, Cochrane playfully works in touches from all over. Hake comes with cod’s roe, XO sauce and nori and a sweetcorn dish is flavoured with miso (1251).The big must-have bakery good this Christmas? It’s the Terry’s Chocolate Orange muffin from Costa, which the coffee shop chain says has been selling at the rate of six a second. Each muffin comes topped with a chocolate orange segment. Apparently, Terry’s was unable to supply inidual segments so the company making the muffins has had to buy in, tap and unwrap tens of thousands of chocolate oranges by hand.Self-described ‘healthy’ fast food chain Leon, is to open two more sites at Motorway services on both the M40 at Beaconsfield and the M25 at Cobham.

Festive drinks are followed by little teasers, a few bites to whet the appetite, but not too much: you need to leave room for the main act. Cheeseboards are, for me, a thing of the past, if only for the fact that I can’t help but go back for more, so now I replace the cheese with just a few rich snacks (you’ll note butter features everywhere this week) to kick-start the party with just the right degree of plenty. This year, I’m making salty anchovy crostinis and the most indulgent hush puppies, and later, because even dessert needs a pre-dessert, a chocolate salami for the final, dramatic close.This is a great little festive snack to hand around at a party, together with your favourite sparkling wine. The butter is quite rich, so two soldiers per person are more than enough.Prep 15 minCook 10 minMakes 12, to serve 67 anchovy fillets, drained and roughly chopped1 small garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped½ green chilli, seeds and pith removed, finely chopped 75g unsalted butter, well-softened to room temperature1 lime – zest finely grated, to get 1½ tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tsp 3 slices sourdough bread, well toasted or grilled Olive oil, for drizzling ½ tbsp parsley leaves, finely chopped, to serveBlack pepperPut the first four ingredients into the small bowl of a food processor with the lime juice and a teaspoon of the zest. Blitz until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times as you go. Refrigerate if not using straight away you’ll need to bring it back up to room temperature when using.Cut the toast into 12 6cm-long x 2cm-wide soldiers. Spread each soldier with about 10g of the butter mix, drizzle with a little oil and finish with the parsley, the remaining lime zest and some freshly ground black pepper.Hush puppies are tasty bites of fried cornbread batter from the American South. They’re made with everything you’d find in cornbread, but they are fried instead of baked so are wonderfully crisp. The maple butter gives these a sweetsalty edge, but if that’s not your thing, serve them with melted salted butter and hot sauce instead.Prep 10 minCook 25 minMakes 24, to serve 6-8 as a snack170g coarse polenta (not quick-cook) 65g plain flour1 tbsp caster sugar1½ tsp baking powder¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda1 tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar½ tsp chilli flakes1 tsp flaked salt 120g plain yoghurt2 large eggs10g fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped120g stilton, roughly crumbled700ml sunflower oil, for deep-fryingFor the maple butter80ml maple syrupFlaked salt120g unsalted butter, fridge-cold, cut into 1½cm cubesPut the first eight ingredients in a large bowl and whisk to combine. In a small bowl, whisk the yoghurt, eggs and fresh coriander, then stir into the large bowl with the cheese until just combined. Do not over-mix.Heat the oil in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, form ping-pong-ball-sized balls of the mixture (each weighing roughly 25g), making about 24 in total. Drop six or seven balls one by one into the hot oil, and fry for two to three minutes, or until golden all over and cooked through. Transfer to a tray lined with kitchen paper and keep warm while you cook the remaining two or three batches (turn down the heat a little if they brown too quickly). While you’re frying the hush puppies, make the maple butter. Put the maple syrup and a pinch of flaked salt in a small saucepan on medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat to low and add a quarter of the cold butter cubes. Whisk to incorporate, then repeat until all the butter is used up. Don’t let the sauce boil at all, or it’s likely to split. Set aside until ready to serve.Serve the hush puppies warm with the butter alongside, for dipping.This chocolate salami won’t stick around for long – one bite leads to another, and the rest is history.

Fold in the biscuits and nuts, then transfer to the fridge for 25 minutes, until cooled but not set.Get ready a large sheet of greaseproof paper, and spoon the cooled chocolate mix on to it. Use the paper to help you roll out the chocolate into a 30cm-long x 6cm-wide log or salami shape. Twist the ends of the paper to enclose the chocolate mix, then put on a tray and refrigerate until set – about five hours. Remove from the fridge a few times during that period, and roll the salami again in its paper wrapping, so it keeps its rounded shape.Sift half the icing sugar on to a large piece of greaseproof paper, then unwrap the log directly on to it.

Offensively so, according to my mother, who has left her slice uneaten on the side of her plate. My father has, miraculously, gone back for seconds. He will regret this later.“I just think the flavour is all right,” he says. “You just have to get over the fact that the texture feels like it’s raw, and feels like you’re eating playdough – which I haven’t done for some time.”Forcing my parents to trial three different versions of vegan ham was probably unkind. When we were children, my sister and I were not allowed to refuse to eat something until we had at least tried it, leading to one long afternoon at the dining table spent waiting for us to eat some pâté on a biscuit – a particularly middle-class form of child torture.Were those memories at the fore when I devised this experiment? Possibly. Revenge is a dish best served 25 years late and made of vital wheat gluten.The purpose of the vegan ham experiment – or vam-off, if you will – was to determine which of three vegan “ham” recipes would be the best porcine replacement at a meat-free Christmas dinner.The verdict, by universal agreement from two omnivorous boomers (mum and dad) and one vegetarian millennial (me), was: none of them.The options were: a glazed tofu roast the bright orange “vegan ham” seitan loaf and a pre-prepared Field Roast Celebration Roast, also made of seitan and flavoured like turkey stuffing. Watermelon ham was left off the list by virtue of already being proved terrible.With the exception of the celebration roast, which I fashioned into a chia pet with fresh herbs then roasted as per packet instructions, I cooked the ham alternatives from scratch and take full responsibility for their utter failure.Saturday night was spent pressing and marinating the tofu and wrestling with the seitan. Seitan is essentially a dense glutinous bread. Unlike with regular bread, the aim is to make it as tough and heavy as possible. To this end, the recipe recommended using a standing mixer (which I don’t have) and a tight foil wrap during baking, which it escaped.Despite being flavoured almost entirely by tomato paste and vegetable stock, it has a curiously penetrative scent: when I wake on Sunday my face smells like vegan ham. I wash it again. The smell remains.On Sunday evening, the tofu is baked for an hour, glazed, covered in far too many cloves and baked again for 30 minutes. The seitan-vam – glazed with a combination of tomato paste, maple syrup and yet more liquid smoke – also gets another 30 minutes in the oven.Like every game of make-believe, much hinges on the willing suspension of belief. If you are familiar with the look but not the taste of glazed ham, and you really want to believe this is an acceptable substitute for ham, then you could possibly make that claim. But it’s a bit like eating wax fruit and claiming it tastes like an apple.If the aim is to create something that looks slightly like a leg of ham, and definitely looks impressively complicated, then seitan is the winner.Both the vam and the tofu have produced a crackling-like crust. At this point, I am feeling smug. Dad is carefully angling them near the window and climbing on the bench to take photos. This has been a success.My smugness lasts as long as it takes for dad to take his first bite. The vegan ham, he says, is like “uncooked pizza dough”.The celebration roast is fine – it tastes like commercial turkey stuffing and is filled with enough salt to keep a family dehydrated for three days – and by universal agreement is the most palatable of the three.The tofu is flavourless apart from acrid spears sent down by the cloves. Mum says it’s “inoffensive”. Dad thinks it is worse than the seitan loaf but he has never been fond of tofu – he once said tofu was not his favourite food, which in our family is akin to Darryl Kerrigan saying he doesn’t like his wife’s rissoles. Everything is Dad’s favourite.He is fascinated by the seitan, which manages to taste raw despite being baked for 90 minutes. “The playdough one at least looks a bit like ham, doesn’t it?” he says. “I’m going to eat the bum end of it and see what that’s like.”The bum is no better.Mum ranks the seitan “a very poor 57th”, saying it has “an odd flavour and it’s texturally unpleasant”.That uncooked texture would possibly be resolved if I had any idea what I was doing, but the central problem remains. It is a substance produced by the starship Heart of Gold: almost, but not quite, entirely unlike ham. Failure is writ into the very concept: if you want to eat ham, then eat ham. No amount of manipulation will make plant matter come close.Nobody wants the leftovers. The dog already has digestive issues, so we decide not to risk it. My parents happily point out that vegan food is at least compostable, and then wonder if the vegan ham will be like the old doormat, which moved house four times in the compost bin before finally breaking down.I receive permission to make a vegan dish for family Christmas, but only if I don’t attempt to make any part of it in any way resemble meat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb31b56b4534c944ea56db555a12c0427e94654/0_158_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=743b0f9182b4decab2fd32addcc0835e","title":"chelsea bournemouth premier league match report","story":"First the delay, then the wild, disbelieving celebrations. As the wait went on Bournemouth began to sense the VAR check was going to fall in their favour. Dan Gosling, more alert than anyone in a Chelsea shirt when his big opportunity arrived, had a feeling the linesman was wrong to flag him offside. The midfielder ran towards the big screen that was signalling his disallowed goal was being reviewed and before long he was being mobbed by his jubilant teammates, whose spirit and fearlessness ensured that Eddie Howe’s gameplan worked perfectly.While Howe beamed on the touchline, Frank Lampard watched helplessly. No wonder Chelsea’s manager wants to bring in greater quality up front. This was another uninspired, disjointed performance on home soil from Chelsea’s attackers and it will convince Lampard of the need to address his inconsistent team’s creativity deficit during the January transfer window.Chelsea, whose hold on fourth place looks increasingly uncertain after four defeats in five league games, were out of ideas long before the end and they are developing an unfortunate habit of stumbling against teams in crisis. A fortnight ago it was a home defeat against West Ham, last week it was Everton and this time it was a Bournemouth side missing their first-choice centre-backs, a host of wingers and their main forward.Bournemouth rose four points above the bottom three after halting a five-match losing run with their first win since 2 November. They were impressive for a team supposedly on the slide. Ryan Fraser was a scurrying presence on the left, running at César Azpilicueta and testing Kepa Arrizabalaga with a low drive in the third minute. Jefferson Lerma cut off the supply lines to Mason Mount, Chelsea’s No 10. Gosling never stopped running on his first start this season and Joshua King, who was a doubt with a hamstring injury, was an energetic menace in the second half.“We needed it,” Howe said. “Today has been the best we have fought, the best we’ve competed, the most desire I have seen from the group. I don’t feel there has been a lack of effort but when things have gone against us there has been a feeling of everything conspiring to try to break us. We never had those moments and were able to build the other way.”Chelsea looked weary after reaching the last 16 of the Champions League during the week and Lampard was unhappy with his side’s slow passing. “If you’re transferring the ball transfer it quickly,” he said. “If you’re playing through the lines get it through the lines. If you’re an attacking player get at people, don’t play safe.”There were flickers from Chelsea. After eight minutes Jorginho released Mount, whose dinked effort was saved by Aaron Ramsdale, and Tammy Abraham clipped an early chance wide. Yet there was a sterile feel to Chelsea’s territorial dominance. Willian’s deliveries from the right were predictable and Christian Pulisic never shook off Jack Stacey, Bournemouth’s diligent right-back.It should have not been such a slog. Bournemouth’s defence was shorn of Steve Cook and the hamstrung Nathan Aké, a £40m target for Chelsea, but Simon Francis and Chris Mepham shackled Abraham. Bournemouth also showed belief on the ball, even though they were without Callum Wilson up front.A soporific first half fitted the pattern of Chelsea’s home games this season. They have scored 11 goals in the league at Stamford Bridge and another failure to seize the initiative against a deep defence left Lampard questioning his players’ personality.“I don’t know about fear but in front of our own fans it’s clear now we aren’t playing well enough and getting enough results,” he said. “Up until now I think a lot of it was we’re not taking enough chances because we’re creating a lot and we’re giving away some silly goals. Today wasn’t a ‘We’re creating loads of chances day’. We just didn’t get the fans excited enough. The fans shouldn’t be excited if we’re going to play 10 balls across our back four. That’s not the team I want to manage.”Nothing worked for Chelsea, even after the introduction of Callum Hudson-Odoi and Mateo Kovacic. Willian’s corners kept hitting the first man and Bournemouth were lively on the break after the interval. King broke Chelsea’s offside trap three times. All that was missing was a touch of composure from the striker, typified by the moment when he failed to give Gosling a tap-in.Chelsea almost snatched the points when Ramsdale repelled Emerson Palmieri’s header. It would have been undeserved and Bournemouth took the lead when Gosling, onside by a yard, collected a header back into the area and hooked the ball over Arrizabalaga. Azpilicueta’s effort to clear off the line was in vain and Bournemouth had triumphed here for the third time in five visits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958fe4054dcfb6293e0753cbb26f93ffce25ae7c/0_218_3722_2233/master/3722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d85a3633b2a18255514076fc50675f1","title":"jurgen klopp champions league liverpool","story":"Jürgen Klopp has condemned plans to expand the Champions League group stage as “absolute bollocks” and Fifa’s organisation of the Club World Cup, as Liverpool prepare to participate in the tournament.The leading Premier League clubs, including Liverpool, are reported to support proposals to turn the group stage of the Champions League into a 32-team league from the 2024-25 season.

It is no surprise that the notion, never entirely convincing given Liverpool’s steely excellence, of another title-winning fairytale has come to seem too far-fetched but they might have expected the dream to perpetuate for at least another week. Instead their winning run was halted by a Norwich side who completely deserved their draw and arguably had the better opportunities to win, retaining a threat even when Leicester found some sort of stride after half-time.Norwich had taken the lead through Teemu Pukki’s latest ice-cool finish and, in a strange way, even the manner of the home side’s equaliser spoke to their afternoon’s frustration. Jamie Vardy had scored in eight consecutive league games, a burst of form in line with that streak of Leicester victories, and thought he had made it nine when he met James Maddison’s corner and saw his header flash into the net via Tim Krul’s hand. But the Norwich keeper had actually made the crucial touch, erting the ball goalwards when it had been heading wide, and Vardy’s hopes of nearing his 11-game record from 2015-16 disappeared despite a number of subsequent efforts.“It’s not something we’ve ever spoken about,” Brendan Rodgers said when asked about the receding prospect of challenging Liverpool, now 10 points clear, for first place. “I think everyone else has. The players have been brilliant it says everything that we’ve drawn a game and everyone’s disappointed. We weren’t quite at our level today but we’ve still managed to get a point.”They were so far short in the first half that by the interval Rodgers had ripped up his gameplan and turned a narrow 4-3-1-2 formation into a 4-3-3. Norwich were much the better side over the first half-hour, once they had got over an early scare in which Krul fumbled Youri Tielemans’ shot against an upright, and they should have scored when Pukki could not quite make decisive contact with Max Aarons’ delivery after a slick move had sliced Leicester open.Pukki did get it right in the 26th minute although Rodgers will have been perplexed by the way a simple pass from Tom Trybull cut through their entire midfield, giving Emi Buendía all the space he needed in front of the back four. His slide-rule ball for Pukki was a peach, weighted just well enough to meet the striker’s run past Caglar Soyuncu. The finish, rolled across a rooted Kasper Schmeichel, was customarily outstanding.It turned out Pukki, who could have scored a winner in the dying minutes had Soyuncu and Ricardo Pereira not made last-ditch challenges when he twice got away, finished the game nursing a broken toe. “He’s from Finland so I’m not too concerned,” said Daniel Farke, who does not expect Pukki to miss any matches and cannot afford him to. Pukki has nine Premier League goals this season and it is hardly outlandish to suggest his smart runs and precise shooting may be the difference between relegation and a successful campaign.Norwich may need him less if they could kick their habit of undoing so much work with maddeningly simple concessions. Maddison, their former player, may be an outstanding operator at set-plays but his delivery and Vardy’s peeled run were hardly intricate stuff and at that point it seemed Leicester would clear their heads and push on. Immediately after the equaliser Rodgers replaced Kelechi Iheanacho, abruptly ending the forward’s mini-renaissance, and introduced Demarai Gray. Being hauled off in the first half is never a good look and Rodgers insisted it was a tactical move, to facilitate the formation switch, rather than a response to a flashpoint that occurred shortly before Vardy scored.Norwich felt entitled to receive the ball back when Tom Trybull, aware Buendía was down, knocked it out for a Leicester throw-in. But Iheanacho, failing to get the memo on receiving possession, surged towards the penalty area and was halted only by Christoph Zimmermann’s foul.Now that the danger had passed, half of Norwich’s players piled in furiously on Iheanacho. The mêlée took some resolving, with VAR eventually being deployed to adjudge that Todd Cantwell, who had bent down menacingly towards his prone opponent and appeared to grab at him, did not deserve a red card. Both managers agreed Iheanacho had, as Rodgers said, “totally misread the situation” and it arguably had the effect of stalling Norwich’s dominance.Vardy hit an upright from the tightest of angles early in the second period but, after threatening to build up a head of steam, Leicester never created enough. They found Norwich resolute, with Ben Godfrey imperious at the back, and Farke could bask in what he felt was their best performance of the season. In his opinion Norwich need to show the initiative of “hoover salesmen” in their fight to stay up and this, he said, counted as one successful transaction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7f5c3dd5eadea66b650c232ce2949f96fd6bf1/0_77_2253_1351/master/2253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33d91ae322cc5f8074a3b853a7b6b328","title":"southampton west ham premier league match report","story":"Whether this precious victory is sufficient for Manuel Pellegrini to hold on to his job remains to be seen but West Ham held their nerve to record a second win since September. Sébastien Haller scored his first goal since October to hoist West Ham up to 15th, six points below fifth-placed Sheffield United. West Ham, who have been sounding out potential candidates to replace Pellegrini, could still dispense with the Chilean before Christmas.That would seem cruel given the way West Ham performed here, dominating until a wobble late on when they survived a Southampton onslaught to seal victory. Asked whether he expected to be in charge against Crystal Palace on Boxing Day, Pellegrini was diplomatic. “You never know, you never know,” he said. “I don’t think that your job depends on whether you win or you lose, I think it depends on the trust of the owners of the club and I’m absolutely sure that they trust in what we do, but I cannot answer that question.”After Haller scored he ran to celebrate with the substitute Issa Diop while his manager punched the air. “I don’t know exactly if the word is relief,” Pellegrini said. “I’m always talking with the players that we must play the same way we work every day of the week, we must try to be a solid team and score goals and I think we are able to do it better. We lost three important games at home, games which maybe are the difference between a very good season and a bad season that we are doing.”Festive cheer has been in short supply at West Ham but this victory may bring Pellegrini a slice of respite. Pellegrini had pointed to his team’s performance in victory at Chelsea a fortnight ago as evidence that his players retain faith in his methods and it was difficult to argue against that defence after an encouraging display here. Michael Antonio, who spent a season on loan at Southampton a decade ago, was outstanding up front alongside Haller, who returned to the starting lineup in place of Felipe Anderson, who was absent through illness. Haller would have doubled his and West Ham’s advantage in the second half but for a fine stop by Alex McCarthy and Antonio, who bullied Southampton’s backline throughout, had a goal ruled out by the video assistant referee, Jon Moss, after replays showed the forward handled in the buildup.Jan Bednarek and Jack Stephens never got to grips with Antonio. He displayed the kind of hunger that was lacking in Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side and, when Haller struck, it was no surprise that his partner proved the catalyst. Antonio burst beyond Bednarek before laying the ball off for Robert Snodgrass, whose sweeping first-time cross found Pablo Fornals at the back post. Fornals cushioned a header into the path of Haller, whose scruffy volley bounced in off McCarthy’s left post. “I think playing with Antonio works better for him, Antonio had a lot of pace and created space and movement,” Pellegrini said.Southampton were painfully slow out of the blocks and ultimately punished for a slovenly performance. Shane Long was guilty of squandering the best opening, failing to tuck home the rebound from an acute angle after Danny Ings rattled the crossbar. Moments later Ings curled a beautiful shot into the corner but the referee, Martin Atkinson, had blown his whistle for a generous foul on the substitute Andriy Yarmolenko.Jack Stephens, who had roamed forward from defence, equally passed up a golden opportunity after the captain Pierre-Emile Højbjerg cut the ball back inside the box. West Ham’s defending became more fraught as the game drew to a frenetic climaxbut they clung on to leave Southampton bruised.“It was a tough game. We were fighting, investing a lot but in the end we were not able to take something,” Hasenhüttl said. “We know that the relegation goes until May and, like last season, it’s about battling for staying in. Everybody knows that. We know what it’s about to stay in the league and we know that it’s a tough fight until the end and we will take this fight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d8e15498a41fe79d8e9b7085af2d74f6e97ab31/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3c2f677fb6d02dd21691b2344d4c21f","title":"blind date savannah tim","story":"What were you hoping for?As someone who hates fish, not a fish restaurant.First impressions?Well, this fish restaurant really does smell like fish.What did you talk about?The Middle East, Northern Ireland, spooning Boris Johnson, past relationships, Savannah’s musical gift, our jobs, and how I could get her fired if I write the wrong thing here.Any awkward moments?Plenty.

Thankfully, as many health experts – and a 2017 “Love Potatoes” campaign from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board – have pointed out, this staple of British cuisine is low in fat, high in fibre and a great source of energy. Bonus points if you eat the vitamin-packed skin.But making an effort not to bin the peel isn’t going to solve the problem of food waste alone. The potato has long been a contributor to the more than £1bn of produce thrown away every year before it even reaches a supermarket.“Potato growing is not precision agriculture. You’re much more at the whim of Mother Nature than with some other vegetables. From year to year, exactly what’s coming at us has quite a lot of variation to it,” explains James Truscott, managing director of Branston.Branston is nearing its 30th anniversary with Tesco, for whom it processes over a third of a million tonnes of potatoes annually. That’s a lot of spuds.To ensure supermarket success, the produce must meet the expectations of customers – some of whom are swayed by appearance. While food-waste-reducing efforts such as “wonky veg bags”, including Tesco’s Perfectly Imperfect range, have emerged in recent years, Truscott points out that we need to be realistic about what sells.“There is an increasing number of consumers who have food waste much higher up their priority list than they might have done a few years ago, which is great. And things like “wonky veg” have real resonance for some customers. But the reality is, great-looking produce sells better.”However, oversized or undersized potatoes are attractive to ready meal manufacturers, something Tesco recognised five years ago when it was trying to find ways to reduce food waste across its business – part of its commitment that no food fit to eat should go to waste across its entire UK operations.Branston, in turn, was able to invest in state-of-the-art peelers that can cope with the wonky veg.“We now take a really big proportion of those secondary potatoes, peel them and then send them off to Samworths to become the mash on the top of a cottage pie,” says Truscott. “Finding other routes to market for the crop is key. We can offer a product customers want and still find a really good added-value home for the rest of it.”Branston sends 350 tonnes of product a week to Samworths from its potato-peeling unit, which means that ready meal we grab when we’re too tired to cook may be more sustainable than we think.But that’s not all. Keen to further stamp out food waste, Branston and Tesco are embracing state-of-the-art technology, an investment that has been helped by a five-year contract to supply Tesco with most of its fresh potatoes. Introducing the “digital potato”, which predicts how likely the crop is to get damaged during harvesting, washing and sorting.“It looks like a potato, but it’s bright orange and blue,” says Truscott. “It’s basically got a load of sensors in it. You plant it in the field, and then harvest it and see how much damage happens on the harvester. You can put it through washes and graders on the production lines too to see if there are particular points of impact, so that we can address those with a smarter design.”And just when you thought the potato couldn’t get more high-tech, Truscott reveals that the company has launched a new system that started life as a 3D camera from an Xbox.“We will mount it on harvesters and it will count and size all of the potatoes on the harvest bed, so we know exactly what’s coming at us,” he explains.“Right now, growers go into a potato field with a fork, dig up a few potato plants and measure them. It’s a method that’s been used for centuries, but it’s a tiny snapshot and statistically not a very good view as to what’s coming.”The camera will enable growers to see the size profile and expected yield of crop for every field. This information will hopefully generate fewer potatoes that would have otherwise gone to waste.“We’re really excited about technology, because it’ll help growers get better at what they do in the field, and therefore be more sustainable,” says Truscott. “But it’ll also allow us to plan really, really well.”Tesco’s long-term partnerships with its suppliers means they can then invest in new technology, such as Branston’s major investment in handling and packing tech, and work together to cut food waste.Giving potatoes a new lease of life is not the only way that Tesco is working with its suppliers to reduce the impact producing food has on the environment. Tesco and WWF are working together to halve the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket, partnering with suppliers to drive innovation and tackle sustainability challenges across their supply chains, starting with some of the most popular products in the modern basket, like potatoes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac848d224c9fb92853df841e80551ad4d7156e4/0_55_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd665bce9a0c3e342df6a089a1e181f","title":"we feed 2000 children turning surplus food into free school meals in kenya","story":"One international grower has found an ingenious way to use up surplus produce – while also benefiting its local communitySome pupils at Maua school in Naivasha, Kenya, were so hungry that they’d skip school to search the bushes for wild fruit. Others who didn’t cut class would steal from nearby shops so they’d have something to eat for lunch.Headteacher Rosalin Wafula was growing concerned with the high levels of truancy and signs of poor concentration in the 850 students she looks after.“Some children had food some did not. In a school, we should have equality. But many would feel out of place because they didn’t have anything to eat,” she says.But thanks to a new scheme that turns surplus food from local packhouses into free meals for children, Wafula has seen a big improvement in attendance and classroom participation.Stevenage-based Flamingo Produce has been supplying vegetables such as green beans, baby corn and broccoli from Kenya to Tesco in the UK since 1994, and was looking for ways to reduce food waste and benefit the community at the same time.“In Kenya, we end up with a lot of green beans that are too curly. In the UK, you may have the opportunity to sell them as part of Tesco’s ‘perfectly imperfect’ veg range. But we’re 6,000 miles away and flying such a product is not environmentally, or economically, very wise,” managing director Ian Michell explains.Flamingo had already taken small steps to tackle food waste, such as no longer trimming green beans before they are transported and sold. But Michell knew more could be done.Working with Tesco, he came up with the idea of setting up kitchens in the Kenya packhouse to make soup from the leftover vegetables to give to children at lunchtime. The scheme is based on the supermarket’s Community Food Connection programme in the UK, where leftover food from stores is donated to local charities. To date, Tesco has donated more than 150m meals from surplus food to local charities worldwide.“We’re now feeding 2,000 children a day,” Michell says.It wasn’t as simple as it sounds, though, recalls HR manager Tabitha Ngaywa. Soup isn’t a particularly common meal in Kenya. She was worried the kids wouldn’t actually want to eat it. Luckily, Flamingo Produce’s canteen manager was able to work with pupils and their parents to create a hot meal that the community could enjoy.“We don’t really appreciate soup in Kenya. So when the idea came to us it was a little bit difficult for us to imagine how it would be done,” Ngaywa reveals.Parents, pupils and teachers were brought on board to test the dish. Once feedback was positive, Flamingo Produce went ahead with the pilot in March, recruiting extra staff to help prepare and transport the meals.According to Wafula, Ngaywa needn’t have worried – children often ask for second helpings. She’s seen a great improvement in the quality of their work and attitude in the classroom, too.“Some of these children might not have had dinner the night before, or a proper breakfast in the morning. Their concentration was very low. But now they are very eager to learn. They are able to stay in class and participate. So they love it.”The scheme is in place across two schools in Naivasha now, and Flamingo Produce plans to roll it out to the company’s packhouses in Peru, Guatemala and Morocco soon.“Tesco’s help and funding will allow us to scale this into different regions all over the world. My target is 2m school meals in the year 2020,” says Michell. “We also hope to take a lot more of our products and make them into nutritious meals with long shelf lives. This will help us transport the product anywhere in the world to low-income families.”As Wafula points out, the promise of a free, nutritious meal each day can have a positive impact on mental wellbeing.“Every child should have that sense of belonging. And now, everyone feels equal because they all have something to eat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84a5de75748cc5cdb93ec6a1e7cfb1acd5e26a2c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d49dade6cbc00fa9479805afb7ad849c","title":"keith flint remembered by richard russell","story":"The passion Keith brought to everything was immense, and so was his kindness. He was the embodiment of countercultural values, but he was unlike many musicians who adopt a stance of rebellion, because it wasn’t a pose. He knew who he was. That allowed him to be relaxed and fun, and kind to people. What James Blunt tweeted about him after he died speaks volumes. Everyone felt included when Keith was around. He knew there was no need for rudeness he was a gentleman.I first met Keith around 1990. He’d left Essex in his late teens, and had been travelling across Europe and the Middle East. He had long hair back then as he was a bit of a hippy – a hippy crossed with a punk. He embodied ideals from both of those worlds.When he came back to Britain, he heard about the rave scene through a friend, so went to one, and that was that – he was in. He became friends with Liam Howlett, really encouraged him to do more of his music, and that’s how the Prodigy began. Keith became one of the Prodigy’s dancers, and that’s what he did for the first five years. He was a joyful, natural dancer.He understood the freedom music represented to people, and how they yearned and lived for that at the end of the working week. Keith was the embodiment of that feeling of freedom to me. That’s why his passing feels so massive.Keith’s first vocal for the Prodigy was for Firestarter. I remember seeing him on stage around that time, and being genuinely in awe. He was a very different kind of frontman. He was uncontrived, untethered. He’d go to places on stage no one else could go. He dissolved the barrier between audience and performer, and people connected with him from all kinds of musical backgrounds because of that: not just dance music but hip-hop, punk and metal.At the start of this year my daughter was looking at a celebrity birthday site, and I noticed that Keith’s birthday was on 17 September, and that he was turning 50. I remember getting my diary out straightaway, making a note, thinking: “I’ve got to do something for Keith for that.” But he never got there. I doubt he’d agree with me, but I think he would have been an amazing old man.Keith’s funeral will stay with me for ever. Most funerals are buttoned-down, but his was full of the most authentic expressions of love. Lots of people came just to rave outside – Keith would have loved that. It was such a celebration of his life, as it deserved to be. So many people loved him so much.• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

It is a pointed rhetorical flourish from a man who mostly wears the mantle of street poet-king like a tracksuit made of fine silk.It was, arguably, only a matter of time before grime threw up its true crossover star. That the genre should have found one as analytical, mould-breaking and assured as Stormzy is a particular thrill. His second album continues seamlessly on from 2017’s landmark No 1 Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer. If anything, Heavy Is the Head grandstands harder, sings more sweetly and examines the rapper’s own conscience even more attentively than before.First and foremost, this is a hyper-confident return – top-heavy on front, stats and burns. Joining Wiley Flow and Vossi Bop – two of four strong pre-album tracks – are just shy of half a dozen more cocky tracks, all of which re-establish Stormzy’s verbal pre-eminence with panache. Rather than building a career purely from party rap, songs for “the ladies” or postcode beef, Stormzy has risen largely through the old-school medium of witty bragging – a combination of menace and humour that remains on point here. He does a fine line in pique, his brow furrowed in aggrieved disbelief. “Ah man, the audacity!” he actually growls on the standout Audacity, taking on unnamed pretenders (“ashy youths”) and false friends (“wolves in sheepskin”).Performance statistics abound on Stormzy’s battle raps, as he tots up venue capacities around the country, or boasts about chart positions and units sold – somewhere between a company CEO, Jay Z (his declared role model) and a directeur sportif. Of course, Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr is “young, black, fly and handsome” too (Handsome), as photogenic on the cover of GQ as he is on the cover of Time magazine, being profiled as a Next Generation Leader. On the unapologetic Pop Boy, Stormzy notes that he has become a London “top boy” without actually having to become a gangland supremo.That top boy reference now works internationally too, thanks to the recent Netflix reboot of the Channel 4 crime saga of that name. If Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer enabled Stormzy to headline Glastonbury, Heavy Is the Head makes a bid for Stateside attention too: never before has UK hip-hop had such traction there.The spaciousness, punch and depth of these productions is telling, but it is a mark of the album’s artistic integrity that Stormzy manages to transcend genre (again) without sacrificing his core griminess, or losing too much in the way of accent, word choice, content or theme. There are no obvious North American rapper hook-ups the Hand of Drake is absent.HER is one well-chosen US guest vocalist on One Second, an emotive plea to take time and calculate one’s wellbeing, just as Afrobeats superstar Burna Boy is an apposite, timely guest on Own It – this album’s sole, sultry come-hither.The brassy fanfares that open and close Big Michael, though, are played by London jazz players. Grime’s favourite insult – “suck your mum” – recurs a handful of times, and the busily polyrhythmic Superheroes works as an extended shout out to black British talent, name-checking Malorie Blackman and Dave.But pugnacious localism is only part of Stormzy’s appeal. Heavy Is the Head once again highlights the personal downsides of recognition. Weariness is nothing new in hip-hop – rappers have been counting the cost of being the boss for decades. Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, too, made it clear that Michael Omari felt ambivalent about the noblesse oblige of starriness.Stormzy, though, manages to keep this tired trope fresh. His regrets are legion: the friends for whom he was not there, the street pain from which he is now just a little removed, “the little things”.“They’re sayin’ I’m the voice of young black youth, I say ‘yeah, cool’ and bun my zoot,” he eye-rolls on Crown. While many artists spark up as an act of hedonism or rebellion, Stormzy often smokes his weed in an act of self-medication. There are repeated pleas throughout the album for self-care – to take time out, to remember to breathe, not to let one’s dreams disrupt one’s sleep too much. Exasperation at being misunderstood or misrepresented is never far away, though. “I’m not the poster boy for mental health!” Stormzy exclaims at one point. Another track seethes at the flak Stormzy received for starting a Cambridge scholarship for BAME students (“it’s not anti-white it’s pro-black,” he points out).For all that Stormzy is well able to carry the weight of representing not just south London, British blackness and now the UK creative industries as well, his game does drop sharply on one key track. It is tempting to hear Lessons as an extended apology to Stormzy’s ex, the broadcaster Maya Jama – the two split up earlier this year amid rumours of his infidelity. (That narrative seems borne out by lines like “You gave me the world and I gave you disrespect”.) But Stormzy can only muster sentimental prose here, rather than memorable poetry – a common problem when aggressive rhymers find themselves out of water, floundering in their “feels”. Still: we sorely need better flows about love, not strings of cliches.Bum notes are relatively few, however. The 50-odd minutes of Heavy Is the Head passes in a blur of street status and lyrical power, tempered by nuanced considerations of sacrifice. One reason the crown feels so heavy on Stormzy’s head is that he is acutely aware of the shoulders on which he stands, of the timing that is one aspect to his success. So many previous MCs enjoyed chart heat without becoming national treasures. Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Lethal Bizzle, Skepta and Kano have all made bids for the crown at one time or another, all too often with the club-grime hybrids that marked the decade where MCs could not perform live due to the politan police’s notorious, now defunct Form 696 policy.Ours is an often bewildering era, but that grime is now an export, and that Stormzy is the country’s unofficial poet laureate, is a particularly shiny silver lining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612f404239c45a47cebc6506906bb8a15d326472/0_73_5336_3202/master/5336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d72fd11af58c5ac624a3803184dff414","title":"traviata royal opera house 25 years richard eyre revival","story":"Director Richard Eyre explains why his take on Verdi’s story of heartache and betrayal is still thrilling Covent Garden after a quarter of a centuryThe director Richard Eyre doesn’t boast about his own productions but two in particular make him cry. One is Mary Poppins, the bestselling musical currently back in the West End. “I always weep at the end,” admits this giant of British theatre, former director of the National Theatre, with countless stage and screen credits to his name. “When Mary flies up over the audience I find myself looking up through a veil of tears.” The other is Verdi’s La Traviata, the impassioned tale of the beautiful, doomed Violetta, one of the most popular tear-jerker operas of all time.Eyre’s magnificent 1994 staging opens at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on Tuesday, the 25th anniversary of the production. By the end of this latest run, a total of 34 different sopranos will have sung Violetta, the tragic “fallen woman” of the title. Her nickname, the “lady of the camellias”, is from the novel by Alexandre Dumas fils on which the opera is based. She suffers the ravages and red-cheeked pallor of consumption: the “white death” – pulmonary tuberculosis – which still had no medical identity and no cure when Verdi wrote his opera in 1853. So what makes us love this story of betrayal and heartbreak so much?“Sex and death,” Eyre says bluntly. “A beautiful woman. A callow man. Romantic love. An interfering father. Moral choices. Sickness. Loneliness. It’s got everything.” His ROH production, with sumptuous belle époque designs by Bob Crowley, ranks as one of the company’s top blockbusters. With lavish costumes, architecturally magnificent sets and a grand champagne party, a casino scene, tumbling, dancing and big choruses, Eyre and Crowley have maximised every detail of the drama. “I’ve sent a lot of people who don’t know any opera to La Traviata,” Eyre says. “And they’ve come away amazed, transformed by the power of story and music.”Given the popularity of La Traviata – 900 performances in various productions around the world last year alone – a music critic sees as many Traviatas in a career as a theatre critic might see Romeo and Juliet. After at least a dozen encounters with the Royal Opera’s, I haven’t tired of it. Nor has Oliver Mears, the ROH’s director of opera, who keeps a sharp eye on the quality and validity of each revival.Longstanding productions of favourite operas are nothing new. Two Puccini favourites, La Bohème (by John Copley) and Tosca (by Franco Zeffirelli) each ran for four decades at the Royal Opera before being retired. The same composer’s Turandot, from a 1984 production by Andrei Serban, was still going strong in 2017 and will surely return (not just because of the Nessun dorma aria).“Opera is a living, breathing art form, not a museum,” says Mears. “We can’t just place dusty artefacts on the stage, year after year. Each time I see this Traviata I ask myself, is it holding up, is it still alive? I can say, hand on heart, it absolutely is. The clarity of the staging, the exquisite designs still work their magic. And it provides a showcase for the best singing in the world.”An evergreen revival like La Traviata is vital to the Royal Opera’s coffers. Sets and costumes already exist. The chorus and orchestra know the music. The chief expense is the soloist and conductor. “A big hitter like Traviata helps offset the costs of less familiar or more experimental work,” Mears says, citing new productions, in spring 2020, of Janácek’s Jenůfa and Gerald Barry’s Alice’s Adventures Under Ground.A quarter of a century ago this Traviata production nearly didn’t happen. It was Eyre’s first operatic venture. He was invited by Georg Solti, the internationally revered conductor “who had seen my Guys and Dolls at the National”. Eyre wasn’t keen. He disliked opera. “I had an unreasonable prejudice against the art form. I thought the truth of theatre was in the spoken word – in which I’d invested my working life. I was running the National! The logic was that opera seemed to me wholly, preposterously untruthful.”He soon changed his mind. “And as I worked on Traviata I came to realise what a ridiculous view that was, like blaming tennis for not being football, or an orange for not being a lemon. Opera has its own truths, its own glories, and of course the most extraordinary, fabulous music. To my astonishment, and his shame, Solti had never conducted the work. He told me he had always thought of Traviata as ‘not first-rate Verdi’ and he wanted to apologise to Verdi for this terrible misjudgment – quite rightly, I think.”Eyre insisted on having a “great-looking woman with a lively, wonderful voice” for Violetta. The unknown Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu, who created the role in this production, became an overnight superstar. The BBC cleared its schedules to broadcast the opera. In addition to Eyre and Solti, the “clincher”, according to Peter Maniura, the BBC TV director at the time, was Gheorghiu. Would Eyre make such specifications about his choice of singer now? Would he get away with it? Body shaming is a highly sensitive issue in opera.“You mean asking for a fabulous-looking woman? Well, we’re talking about someone who made her living through selling her body. Sex for cash. I’m not saying it’s an admirable thing for a society to do, but it’s what she did. Dumas’s La dame aux Camélias was based on a real woman, Marie Duplessis. She was sold to a man when she was 12 and went to Paris when she was 15, and became a grande horizontale – a courtesan. She died, like Violetta, of tuberculosis, when she 23, having been admired, and kept, by countless very rich men. She was clearly infinitely desirable.”The sopranos who have sung Violetta for this staging so far reads like a roll call of world opera, Renée Fleming and Anna Netrebko among them. One who, like Gheorghiu, became am overnight sensation was Ermonela Jaho, now in demand worldwide. All but unheard of, she jumped in for an indisposed Netrebko and had to sing with the world’s leading tenor, Jonas Kaufmann, as her lover Alfredo. “I had come on an overnight flight from New York,” Jaho says. “I was trying to catch up on sleep when the call from the ROH came saying I was on in a few hours. I hadn’t even seen the sets until I walked on stage.”As a teenager growing up in communist Albania, Jaho decide to make singing her career specifically having seen La Traviata. “I was 14. It was the first opera I’d ever been to. I went with my brother. It was like falling in love with this passionate, volcanic music. I said to him, I’m absolutely and certainly going to die if I don’t sing La Traviata in my life.” Since that ROH debut, and now with a worldwide following, she has sung about 300 Violettas.“I wonder how much more to sing the role,” Jaho asks herself. “You pour all your experience, all your life’s pain, into Violetta’s story. It’s universal, it’s about human feeling, it’s about connecting with one another. We need this today more than ever. I have dug deep, and sung the end, when she is so ill, with such feeling that I have not always been able to control my emotions.” Currently busy singing Desdemona in another Verdi opera, the Royal Opera’s Otello, her next Traviata is in Munich in February. Five sopranos will sing Violetta at the ROH between now and March, in 21 performances with four different casts: the Armenian Hrachuhí Bassénz, the Azerbaijani Dinara Alieva (making her Royal Opera debut), the Russian Kristina Mkhitaryan, the Polish Aleksandra Kurzak and another Russian, Vlada Borovko. Who will best convey the psychological strength and physical vulnerability of this most challenging of roles? All eyes and ears, especially, will be on 31-year old Borovko, a former ROH Jette Parker Young Artist. She sang the role for the company, stepping in at an hour’s notice, in 2016. Now she’s up there with prime billing.And that weepy moment for Richard Eyre? “The bass drum signals Violetta’s death. Against this darkest of music her voice soars up brilliantly, passionately. It’s like witnessing the agonies of a dying bird. This piece speaks for a profound need in people for open-hearted emotion.” He blinks hard as he speaks. “ Don’t we all enjoy a good cry?”La Traviata is at the Royal Opera House from 17 December until 23 March 2020. Tickets are available from £11 to £225."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7679c932ee4d1c93b3633b4b97422fff893d117/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45cb25ef66ab724e8a25b203c1e1430f","title":"election 2019 john crace on the lowlights and the gaffes","story":"’s political sketch writer, John Crace, runs through the highs and the many, many lows of the 2019 general election campaign.

The question is how can we succeed in future where we didn’t this time?”As the recriminations continued within the party, and potential successors began laying out their stalls, Corbyn’s closest political ally, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said he would be stepping down from the shadow cabinet.McDonnell said that while “Jeremy was the right leader”, it was time for the party to move on under new leadership. “We will all go now. The new leader will come in place and appoint a shadow cabinet. I won’t be part of the shadow cabinet. I’ve done my bit. We need to move on at that stage with that new leader,” he told BBC News.It is understood that Corbyn’s chief supporters will give their backing to McDonnell’s protege, the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, who they hope will carry the torch for the left.Corbyn says the Tories’ central message – to “get Brexit done” – was dishonest and a con. “In towns where the steelworks have closed, politics as a whole wasn’t trusted. But Boris Johnson’s promise to get Brexit done – sold as a blow to the system – was. Sadly that slogan will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is, shattering trust even further.”He also savages the media for its criticism of Labour under his leadership and says the party must do more “to meet this billionaire-owned and influenced hostility head-on”.But as Labour tried to come to terms with its heaviest election defeat since 1935, an increasing number of MPs and candidates who lost their seats tore into Corbyn and his inner circle of advisers.Harriet Harman, responding on Twitter to Corbyn’s Observer article, called on him to step down immediately. “This shows no willingness to understand why @UKLabour suffered this catastrophic defeat,” she tweeted.Peter Kyle, who held on to Hove and Portslade, said Corbyn and his allies could not depart the stage soon enough.“They’ve been waging an ideological and personal war for decades and must now leave others to build a movement fit for the future, rooted in the future, and capable of carrying Labour to power in order to shape the future,” Kyle writes in the Observer.“Voters also said we needed to look more competent, questioning how a party that can’t manage antisemitism out of its own party could possibly run the Home Office.” Wes Streeting, who retained Ilford North, said it was necessary that Corbyn and his allies should “own the defeat” and be held fully responsible for it.But he stressed the need to find a successor as fast as possible. “The urgency arises from local elections next May. If we give the impression that it is business as usual, then decent, hard-working Labour councillors will suffer the same fate as Labour candidates did on Thursday and we cannot allow that to happen.”Today in the Observer two likely candidates in the battle to succeed Corbyn, Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy, spell out their ideas on how Labour can rebuild trust and become more open to ideas from all wings of the party.A spokesman for Corbyn said a timetable for the leadership contest would be decided by the national executive committee, possibly as early as this week. The contest is not expected to start until next month. “There is a feeling that we don’t really want to be starting a leadership contest over Christmas,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa12d8c0a5ff5bbe8fb1a58c177d04fe09fc3c96/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9aca37b4ae15f3e8864240e1d1b8b8cd","title":"election in the media evasion lies good journalism is all we have","story":"Political manipulators in the UK proved they have learnt from the US how to blur truth, but one local paper points to the antidoteIn his first 1,000 days in office Donald Trump made 13,435 false or misleading claims, according to the good folk at the Washington Post who painstakingly monitor the president’s habit of bending the truth. How we Brits have smiled at this con man’s Teflon gift. Could never happen here.But consider the lessons political managers around the world might have learned about our election and how we struggled to negotiate the increasingly blurred lines between truth and falsehood facts and propaganda openness and stealth accountability and impunity clarity and confusion news and opinion.It rather looks as if one or two skilled backroom manipulators (we can guess) studied Trump’s ability to persuade enough people that black is white and, rather than recoil in disgust, came to the opposite conclusion: it works.One far off day we will discover whether 40 new hospitals will be built, and whether 20,000 new police officers will materialise along with 50,000 “new” nurses. It won’t be long before we learn whether we’ve now finally got Brexit “done” or whether this is just the start of a long and painful process of negotiating our future trading relationships with a greatly weakened hand.We’ll learn the reality of whether there is to be frictionless trade between the mainland of Britain and the island of Ireland. We will read the truth about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum … and much more. But by then life will have moved on, and maybe many of us will have forgotten the promises, evasions and outright lies of late 2019.Lessons learned? That, in an age of information chaos, you can get away with almost any amount of misleading. You can doctor videos suppress information avoid challenging interviews – but only after your opponents have been thoroughly grilled. You can expel dissenting journalists from the press pack or hide in a fridge. You can rebrand a fake “fact-checking” website. In the end, none of it matters.Coin one unforgettable message and stick to it. “Get Brexit done” was brilliant, never mind that the meaning of “Brexit” and “done” was far from clear: this is an age of simplicity, not complexity. Even the so-called mainstream media will do far more to amplify that slogan rather than question it. Try this stunt: slap the words on a JCB digger and drive it through a pile of polystyrene bricks ... and watch as news editors obligingly clear their front pages for the image. They are making posters, not doing journalism.And remember that in most countries, governments have unusual power over public service broadcasters. So, in the event that television journalists seem to be getting too big for their boots, it is often useful to drop a heavy hint there will be a price to pay. Maybe Channel 4 has outlived its usefulness? Possibly it’s time to privatise the BBC? That should do the trick.Old-fashioned press conferences should be kept to the minimum. A manifesto should say almost nothing. Gaffe-prone colleagues should be “disappeared”. If in real trouble, make things up. You’ll be amazed how readily even the best journalists will repeat unattributable fictions (see the “row” over the four-year-old boy in Leeds General Infirmary and what “happened” during the subsequent visit of health secretary Matt Hancock). By the time the journalists have corrected themselves and Twitter has spent 24 hours arguing about the truth, the world will have moved on.So, as Trump has discovered, the liars, myth-makers and manipulators are in the ascendancy – and however valiantly inidual journalists attempt to hold them to account (and many, especially at a local level, have tried magnificently) the dice are loaded against them.The one over-riding thought is that for many years I looked at US newspapers and pitied colleagues there who “just” ran the newsroom, leaving comment pages to others. Pity has turned to envy. I now think it would be cleansing for all British national newspapers to split the responsibility for news and comment. It’s simply too hard for the average reader – especially, but not only online – to tell the difference.And a hero? After the Yorkshire Evening Post‘s reporting of the Leeds story was questioned, its editor in chief, James Mitchinson, wrote a long and considered reply to a reader who, on the basis of something she read on social media, thought the story was fake. Mitchinson’s reply courteously asks the reader why she would believe the word of a total stranger (who might not even exist) over a newspaper she had read for many years in good faith.The fact the paper knew the story to be true was, said Mitchinson, down to “bog-standard journalism”. It was a powerful statement of why good journalism – independent and decently crafted – should matter. So let’s hear it for bog-standard journalism. There’s too little of it. It may not be enough, but it’s all we have.Alan Rusbridger is chair of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001f8f1801a1eda9a946cb61d3d4564da7a2375d/0_0_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4882af592ff3858c39c3d0a4f7101f3c","title":"housing charities and food banks report spike in donations after tory win","story":"Organisations protecting the vulnerable such as Shelter, Refuge, the Trussell Trust and the Biscuit Fund welcomed contributionsCharities helping the most vulnerable in society have reported an increase in support after the Conservative victory in the general election.Shelter, Refuge, the Trussell Trust and the Biscuit Fund have all confirmed they have seen a sharp increase in donations andor registered supporters as a result of the election outcome.While unable to give exact numbers, the UK homelessness and housing charity Shelter said it had seen an increase in the number of people signing up as supporters since the result.The Biscuit Fund, which raises money to provide in-need families with supplies ranging from fridges to food hampers amid welfare cuts, said it had also had a considerable boost in support. Between Friday and Saturday, the charity has received almost £3,000 in donations – a number that a spokesperson has described as “significant and very welcome”.The UK’s largest food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, said it had been “overwhelmed” following a huge uplift in donations. While it could not yet give an exact figure, a spokesperson confirmed that hundreds of people have got in touch to set up a monthly donation or make a one-off payment.The boost in support comes as many across the country have expressed despair at the Conservatives, who have overseen nearly a decade of deep cuts to public services since they came to power in 2010, winning the election.Emma Revie, the chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said: “We’re overwhelmed by the wave of support we’ve seen. Thank you so much to everyone who has been donating – we’re incredibly grateful. We know we can reach a future where no one needs a food bank, but we can’t do it alone. We must work together – this can change.”Sandra Horley CBE, the chief executive of Refuge, said: “Now that the general election is behind us, we implore the incoming Conservative government to work on addressing violence against women and girls. The government needs to make this a priority and commit funds and resources to doing so.“Survivors have waited too long already. The domestic abuse bill, which was lost due to the snap election, needs to be quickly reinstated and strengthened to be a truly transformative piece of legislation.“We need an immediate commitment to new funds for refuges, which face closure up and down the country. No woman or child should be turned away when they seek help, survivors need to know that help and support is there for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da2b2985284b9124fde2cc3c5a1c2e39e882ccef/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d4b439959fa31f387394edf603a290a","title":"labour meltdown change america europe left radical candidates","story":"British voters’ ruthless rejection of Jeremy Corbyn and his radical socialist project reads like a cautionary tale for leftwing political leaders and parties in the US and Europe. Will Labour’s crushing defeat dim their ardour, or will they double down on revolution?The general election outcome will embolden Democratic party critics of Bernie Sanders, a 2020 US presidential hopeful whose outlook has often been likened to Corbyn’s. Both men are veteran hard-left campaigners with strong appeal among younger, post-crash voters.Sanders is currently running well behind Joe Biden, the main centrist candidate, in most Democratic primary polls, and is vying for second place with another leftwinger, Elizabeth Warren. That has led to speculation about a combined Sanders-Warren leftist “dream ticket”. Yet national surveys of voting intentions show Sanders beating Donald Trump in November next year by an average of 8.4 points. Biden’s equivalent predicted winning margin is 9.8 points. Warren could win, too, the polls suggest. At present, Sanders has no reason to bow out.Sceptics argue that despite these figures, Sanders cannot win next year. Once voters take a close look at his and Warren’s ideas about universal, NHS-style healthcare provision, business taxes, immigration and workers’ rights, the critics say, they will shy away, as was the case with Corbyn.Supporters of Sanders and Warren insist the opposite is the case. Corbyn-like, they say they offer voters a chance to change a system that is “rigged” against ordinary working families. Sanders calls this “democratic socialism”. Detractors call it “welfarism”.Corbyn’s relative success in Britain’s 2017 election was seen as inspirational by some on the American left. Writing in the Nation in April, Robert Borosage was full of optimism about the year ahead. “The coming British and US elections could mark not simply a change of the party in power but the end of the 40-year conservative era and the beginning of a reform era,” Borosage wrote in a commentary headlined: “Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn might create a Revolution”.That fantasy is punctured now. Even before Labour’s meltdown, the palpable fear in Democrat circles was that by offering radical reform, rather than simply a safe, mainstream replacement for Trump, the party could forfeit a historic opportunity – and let Trump back in. Labour faced the same dilemma – and missed an open goal.The grassroots Democratic party, like Labour, has moved further left in recent years. Hillary Clinton’s narrow loss in 2016 was seen on the left as a defeat for discredited notions about where the political centre really lies, and what people really want.This ideological battle may intensify following the decision of Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, to enter the race. Biden was quick to wade in on Friday, saying: “Look what happens when the Labour party moves so, so far to the left.”While Trump would probably relish a one-on-one fight with Sanders or Warren, Republicans worry that Biden and potentially Bloomberg could more easily win over the white, working-class voters on whom the election will hinge and who in Britain defected to the Tories in decisive numbers.As they reflect on Labour’s failure, European leftwing parties are likely to draw a distinction between Corbyn and his policy platform. Anecdotal evidence suggests personal dislike and distrust of Corbyn on the economy, national security and Brexit were big negative factors.In contrast, Labour activists insist Corbyn’s ideas about a fairer, more equal society serving “the many not the few”, the ending of austerity, and new funding for health, social care and education were popular on the doorstep. These issues resonate across post-2008 Europe, too.But while Europe’s social democrats have made a comeback in 2019, finding an unabashedly socialist party that enjoys sole power is a big ask in Europe these days. Europe’s rightwing populists– Italy’s Matteo Salvini, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France, Germany’s AfD, and the ruling parties in Poland and Hungary – will meanwhile enjoy the British left’s electoral debacle. The hard right did not do as well as it hoped in last summer’s EU parliamentary elections. But at national and regional level, it is formidable and gaining.Germany’s Social Democrats face a particular dilemma. With support at record lows, the party recently picked two leftwingers as joint leaders in a bid to renew itself. Now the SDP must be wondering if it has voted for extinction.The EU itself is maintaining its usual, lofty neutrality. But centrist leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel will be concerned by the example set by Johnson’s brazenly populist campaign, and what a buoyant rightwing government in London will mean not only for Brexit but for overall future relations.The stand-out success of the SNP, presaging a possible constitutional clash with Westminster over a second referendum on Scottish independence, is another potential worry for the EU. An independent Scotland seeking instant membership would be an embarrassment. And Brussels certainly does not want another Catalonia.Crowing and self-congratulation on the right has already started in the US, with suggestions that Johnson has provided a signpost to a Trump second term, in part by persuading long-standing opposition voters to switch sides.“For the US, the British results are profoundly encouraging,” said Fox News commentator Theodore Bromund. “Britain should now be able to get Brexit done by the new deadline of 31 January. This, in turn, means that Britain and the US will be able to negotiate a free trade area in the near future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1106fc022e80a8ff834bb256fad4f947ffe45615/0_113_4524_2715/master/4524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f18177db7ad2158d638cfcdfd22ef8a5","title":"sturgeon scotland wants different future from rest of uk","story":"SNP leader says election results made clear Scottish voters don’t want a Boris Johnson government or BrexitBoris Johnson cannot “bludgeon” Scotland into seeing the world in the same way that he does, Nicola Sturgeon has said after telling the new prime minister that the election results made it clear that Scots want a different future to the rest of the UK.Speaking at the V\u0026ampA museum in Dundee on Saturday where she joined the Scottish National party’s newly elected MPs, Sturgeon insisted it is unsustainable for the Tories to keep saying no to a fresh vote. While the Conservatives gained a large Commons majority, the SNP took 48 of the 59 Scottish seats.“I wasn’t sure how much he’d had a chance to catch up with the Scottish results,” Sturgeon said of her conversation with Johnson on Friday.“I pointed out to him, politely of course after I congratulated him, that the Scottish Tories, having fought the election on the single issue of opposition to an independence referendum, had lost – lost vote share, lost more than half of their seats.“It was a watershed election on Thursday and it’s very clear that Scotland wants a different future to the one chosen by much of the rest of the UK.“Scotland showed its opposition to Boris Johnson and the Tories, said no again to Brexit, and made very clear that we want the future of Scotland, whatever that turns out to be, to be decided by people who live here.“You can’t bludgeon a nation into accepting your view of the world when it is made very clear that it doesn’t have that view of the world.“It couldn’t really be any clearer from the results of this election that Scotland doesn’t want a Boris Johnson government, it doesn’t want to leave the European Union, and it wants to be able to determine its own future, whatever that future turns out to be.”The UK could only continue to exist by consent, Sturgeon said, adding that if Johnson has confidence in his case for continuing the union then he should let the people decide, “because he won’t get away with just saying no and trying to bludgeon the nation of Scotland into seeing the world as he does, which most of us don’t”.Many in the country were worried about the prospect of five years of Tory government led by Johnson, Sturgeon said. Such a “grim reality”, she said, “makes that case for Scotland being able to choose something different all the more urgent and all the more important.”Sturgeon’s comments came as one of Scotland’s leading Labour politicians, Alison Evison, the president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), called for a second referendum on Scotland’s independence and said democracy had become “fragile”.Writing on Twitter, Evison, who is a Labour councillor in Aberdeenshire, said: “It’s straightforward to me: democracy must be at the core of all we do. Recently it has become fragile and we must strengthen it again. We can strengthen it by enabling the voice of Scotland to be heard through its formal processes \u0026amp that must mean a referendum on independence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6de793d8431bdc6adab80ec0cdd982e4761478ec/0_140_4261_2556/master/4261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a6f49e565e1810687ad1e71918c3c3a","title":"tactical voting what went wrong general election 2019","story":"In the end, fears of a Corbyn government and disdain for Jo Swinson’s election campaign combined to defeat tactical voting. Over the past four weeks, the Observer has reported on constituency polls designed to assist voters wanting to oppose the Conservatives and stop Brexit. Last Sunday, we recommended candidates in 50 seats. Our results were not great. Non-Conservatives won only 13 of these seats of these, nine were SNP gains in Scotland. In England, our preferred candidates triumphed in only four seats: Putney and Portsmouth South (Labour) and Richmond Park and St Albans (Liberal Democrat).Why so few successes? It was not the fault of Deltapoll’s data. Almost everywhere, they identified the correct challenger. Most dramatically, they showed rightly that the Liberal Democrats were snapping at Dominic Raab’s heels, despite the foreign secretary’s apparently impregnable 23,000 majority.In a number of our 50 seats, the candidate we showed running third saw their vote squeezed. Examples were Labour in Wimbledon and the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Lib Dems in Putney and Hendon. In some places, isions in the tactical voting community helped the Conservatives.Three high-profile defectors to the Lib Dems suffered from local voters receiving conflicting, and sometimes changing, advice: Luciana Berger (in Finchley and Golders Green), Chuka Umunna (Cities of London and Westminster) and Sam Gyimah (Kensington).In Kensington, judgement was particularly tricky. We backed Gyimah when our survey showed him well-placed to win. A later survey by the same pollster showed Emma Dent Coad, who gained the seat for Labour in 2017, overtaking Gyimah. This trend proved to be more powerful than the contested tactical advice: Gyimah ended up third, and Dent Coad lost the seat narrowly.Deltapoll’s data showed what tactical voting was up against. Lib Dem supporters were reluctant to help Corbyn become prime minister. Likewise, Tory Remainers feared voting for a badly led Lib Dem party that might support Corbyn. These Tories preferred a Brexit Britain governed by Johnson to a stop-Brexit government led by Corbyn.The big lesson is that tactical voting needs not just a common enemy, but a broadly common vision, shared by the Labour and Lib Dem leaders. This was the case with Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown in 1997 it was not with Corbyn and Swinson last week.In all this, one success deserves to be recognised. Seven of the 11 national eve-of election surveys, including Opinium, the Observer’s Britain-wide pollsters, predicted the support for every party to within two percentage points. One cannot reasonably ask for a better performance.Peter Kellner is a polling expert and former president of YouGov"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cba75c944af766095b267684b5dce074c18df1f/182_277_2869_1721/master/2869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b377e8d46a3e285dd34b390f4c2f6a","title":"we won the argument but i regret we didnt convert that into a majority for change","story":"We must now ensure that the working class, in all its ersity, is the driving force within our partyWe are living in highly volatile times. Two-and-a-half years ago, in the first general election I contested as Labour leader, our party increased its share of the popular vote by 10 percentage points. On Thursday, on a desperately disappointing night, we fell back eight points.I have called for a period of reflection in the party, and there is no shortage of things to consider. I don’t believe these two contrasting election results can be understood in isolation.The last few years have seen a series of political upheavals: the Scottish independence campaign, Labour’s transformation, Brexit, the Labour electoral surge, and now Johnson’s “Get Brexit Done” victory. None of that is a coincidence.The political system is volatile because it is failing to generate stable support for the status quo following the financial crash of 2008. As Labour leader I’ve made a point of travelling to all parts of our country and listening to people, and I’ve been continually struck how far trust has broken down in politics.The gap between the richest and the rest has widened. Everyone can see that the economic and political system is not fair, does not deliver justice, and is stacked against the majority.That has provided an opening for a more radical and hopeful politics that insists it doesn’t have to be like this, and that another world is possible. But it has also fuelled cynicism among many people who know things aren’t working for them, but don’t believe that can change.I saw that most clearly in the former industrial areas of England and Wales where the wilful destruction of jobs and communities over 40 years has taken a heavy toll. It is no wonder that these areas provided the strongest backlash in the 2016 referendum and, regrettably for Labour, in the general election on Thursday.In towns where the steelworks have closed, politics as a whole wasn’t trusted, but Boris Johnson’s promise to “get Brexit done” – sold as a blow to the system – was. Sadly that slogan will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is, shattering trust even further.Despite our best efforts, and our attempts to make clear this would be a turning point for the whole direction of our country, the election became mainly about Brexit.A Conservative party prepared to exploit isions capitalised on the frustration created by its own failure to deliver on the referendum result – to the cost of a Labour party seeking to bring our country together to face the future.The polarisation in the country over Brexit made it more difficult for a party with strong electoral support on both sides. I believe we paid a price for being seen by some as trying to straddle that ide or re-run the referendum.We now need to listen to the voices of those in Stoke and Scunthorpe, Blyth and Bridgend, Grimsby and Glasgow, who didn’t support Labour. Our country has fundamentally changed since the financial crash and any political project that pretends otherwise is an indulgence.Progress does not come in a simple straight line. Even though we lost seats heavily on Thursday, I believe the manifesto of 2019 and the movement behind it will be seen as historically important – a real attempt at building a force powerful enough to transform society for the many, not the few. For the first time in decades, many people have had hope for a better future.That experience, shared by hundreds of thousands of people, cannot be erased. Our task as a movement, and a party that has more than doubled in size, is not over: it now has the urgent task of defending the communities that will come under sustained assault from Boris Johnson’s government and the toxic deal he wants with Donald Trump.And it must set about ensuring that sense of hope spreads and deepens. As socialists we seek to raise people’s expectations. People in our country deserve so much more – and they can have it, if we work together to achieve it.I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate. But I regret that we did not succeed in converting that into a parliamentary majority for change.There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions. The question is, how can we succeed in future where we didn’t this time?There is no quick fix to overcome the distrust of many voters. Patronising them will not win them over. Labour has to earn their trust. That means the patient work of listening and standing with communities, especially as the government steps up its assault. And it means ensuring that the working class, in all its ersity, is the driving force within our party.The media attacks on the Labour party for the last four and a half years were more ferocious than ever – and of course that has an impact on the outcome of elections. Anyone who stands up for real change will be met by the full force of media opposition.The party needs a more robust strategy to meet this billionaire-owned and influenced hostility head-on and, where possible, turn it to our advantage.We have suffered a heavy defeat, and I take my responsibility for it. Labour will soon have a new leader. But whoever that will be, our movement will continue to work for a more equal and just society, and a sustainable and peaceful world.I’ve spent my life campaigning for those goals, and will continue to do so. The politics of hope must prevail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bbd70692293f199ef101354c48277fc535d0b96/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43bd9ad3fa4f625643a74168f4b80e84","title":"woman likely to lead labour jostling to succeed jeremy corbyn begins","story":"Six of the seven probable challengers are female, and all will be keen to connect with traditional party supportersThe battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn and shape the future direction of the Labour party is under way as potential successors set out their leadership stalls for the first time, amid bitter recriminations after the party’s worst general election defeat since 1935.Two of the likely candidates in what will be a 12-week contest that is expected to begin in January – Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy – break cover with articles in the Observer, expressing their anger and dismay at the party’s crushing defeat, and calling for a far-reaching post-mortem to ensure Labour reconnects with the millions of working people who rejected it.Seven MPs, six of them women – Phillips, Nandy, Emily Thornberry, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner and Yvette Cooper – are understood to be thinking of joining the contest, making it likely that Labour will for the first time elect a female leader. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is also likely to join the race.In the early hours of Friday, when the scale of Labour’s defeat was known, Corbyn announced that he would not lead Labour into another election but would stay to allow the party a period of “reflection” until a new leader was elected.While many MPs have attacked him for refusing to go sooner, and for his initial refusal to apologise personally for the crushing loss, others argue that the party should avoid a bitter blame game.In what appears to be a pitch for the top job, Phillips argues that the party must broaden its appeal so it can once again attract a coalition of support from both the working class and middle classes. But she goes out of her way to insist that she is not advocating a return to the approach of New Labour.“Some call me a Blairite because I’m evangelical about the difference Sure Start and tax credits made to my life. But I marched against Iraq, I didn’t even become an MP until eight years after he’d left parliament, so how does that fit?”She is severely critical of the way Corbyn and his supporters have seized control of the party machine and excluded those with different views. “The truth is there are corners of our party that have become too intolerant of challenge and debate,” she writes. “There is a clique who don’t care if our appeal has narrowed as long as they have control of the institutions and ideas of the party.“We’ve all got to discover the courage to ask the difficult questions about the future of our party and the future of the working class communities who need a Labour government.” Nandy also argues that the party has “lost touch with the day-to-day lived experience of many of the people we want to represent” and must reconnect with them by listening and becoming more “rooted in our communities”. Only that way could Labour understand the practical needs of working people and respond to them.Also writing in the Observer today, Corbyn says there is “no doubt” about the popularity of Labour’s policies. However, Nandy says that some of the manifesto made little sense. “Nationalising rail is a good, sound policy, but should we have staked so much of our campaign on that policy when so many of the towns we lost have no train station and rely on buses anyway? Should we really be rejecting nuclear power when it is one of the best sources of good jobs outside of London?”On Saturday senior Labour figures said that Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was already being promoted by the Corbyn circle as his favoured successor.Sharp differences of view were expressed over whether Corbyn should continue as leader for the next few months or go sooner.But , also writing in this paper, Labour MPs Lucy Powell and Shabana Mahmood, who held their seats of Manchester Central and Birmingham Ladywood, urge the party not to indulge in a bitter blame game, and instead to work together to learn the lessons for the long term.“Our starting point for a Labour recovery can’t be to pick the things we like and blame the things that we don’t. Some want to say our defeat was all about Jeremy Corbyn, others that it was only Brexit. Both are wrong. It’s clear that our losses were about both and much, much more.“We must now undertake a real and meaningful review with everything on the table, and no no-go areas. It must start from a place of humility which acknowledges Labour got it wrong rather than the voters, with a process that involves the whole of our movement, and those who feel we’ve left them behind.”Angela Eagle, who retained the Merseyside seat of Wallasey, said there were many people at the top of the party, including senior officials and advisers, who needed to think seriously about whether it was credible for them to carry on after the election disaster. “There are a lot of people who need to reflect and consider their positions, not just the leadership in parliament.”Corbyn will face a difficult few days after parliament returns on Tuesday. He is expected to address a meeting of the parliamentary party that day, then taking part in prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, before accompanying Johnson on the traditional walk from Commons to Lords on Thursday for the Queen’s speech."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efda27ed512666555449ec15c4243e808a756e87/0_72_2685_1611/master/2685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f78a348bf42277de4e9d3860029bdbc","title":"saracens munster champions cup match report","story":"There are bigger issues on Saracens’ minds these days but they remain just about in contention for one competition, at least, of which they are the champions. An ugly, bad-tempered win over Munster keeps them on the shoulders of the Irishmen in Pool Four, albeit seven adrift of Racing 92. Two tries in the last quarter did for the province, who for most of the match had resisted manfully a rather lacklustre Saracens.Lacklustre, that is, until a brawl broke out involving virtually every player on the pitch 10 minutes into the second half. The Munster doctor is alleged to have made a comment regarding Jamie George’s weight. Whatever it was, the normally jovial George really did not like it. All hell broke loose. This may not be the last to be heard of the incident, with Sarries considering whether to make a formal complaint.“I think we need to decide what we are going to do,” said Mark McCall. “From what I know something pretty bad was said to Jamie. Clearly it shouldn’t happen. I don’t think what was said was good at all.”Owen Farrell, captain for the day, engaged with particular feeling, squaring off with his fellow Lions half-back Conor Murray. Should Farrell suffer from a persecution complex, it would have deepened, as he was penalised for the incident. He had a one-in-30 chance. But the desired effect of a more energised home team was achieved. “I think the team we were in the last 25 minutes is the team we want to be,” said McCall.They should keep the Munster doctor’s comment on a loop because they needed the hurry-up, despite a more familiar line-up for the home return of this double-header against Munster. After the alternative line-up Saracens fielded in Limerick last week, they elected to go more or less full bore here. There was no Maro Itoje or Brad Barritt but otherwise the usual suspects were in attendance.Not that there was any noticeable uplift in performance until that final quarter. Saracens are used to shaking off defenders more easily than against this well-organised and feisty Munster team. They rode the loss of their captain, Peter O’Mahony, in the warm-up. Then they lost Tadhg Beirne to a horrible-looking leg injury after only 10 minutes and John Ryan followed him down the tunnel, limping but on his feet at least, before half-time.A penalty apiece from Farrell and JJ Hanrahan was all the scoreboard had to show for the opening 40, both following attacking lineouts. Breakthroughs, otherwise, were hard to come by. A flat Farrell pass put Max Malins, looking lively at full-back, half through. He was tackled metres short but Saracens could not finish. Malins turned defender for Munster’s closest encounter with the line, hauling down Andrew Conway. Munster could not finish either but their penalty followed in short order. Farrell even missed one. It was shaping up to be that kind of day.Then the temperature rose early in the second half with that brawl. Hanrahan had edged Munster in front with a penalty a few minutes in, whereupon George started raging. One of the more impassioned brawls of modern times broke out, players crashing over the hoardings in each other’s arms. French referees tend to be more tolerant of this sort of thing than the rest. Monsieur Gaüzère merely picked on Farrell, who had run in from around 10 yards to join the seething throng, for a penalty only. In keeping with the hint of farce Hanrahan missed it.Saracens emerged from the chaos energised at last, the Vunipola brothers rediscovering themselves. Suddenly, there was a more familiar snap to their game. With quarter of an hour to go they scrummed a series of penalties. Billy Vunipola was held up from the first. Then he knocked on as he charged from the next before, from the third scrum, shrugging through three Munster defenders to release Sean Maitland to the corner for try number one.His brother was key to the second. Mako stood in between some fine interplay between Farrell and Malins, looking every inch as much the fly-half as either, and Vincent Koch was away, then Nick Tompkins. Vunipola resumed in a more appropriate role when he finished from point-blank range for the try that broke Munster’s resistance.The quarter-finals remain a long shot but, if Saracens can win their remaining pool matches in January, away at Ospreys and home to Racing, they will be in with a chance for a runners-up spot if Munster drop any points. No pool winner would fancy that visit, all doctors under a strict gagging order."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed1447a249dac20e5c7d2b3a93b7afb45bbcac6/164_234_1143_686/master/1143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d04b6e75db1d17b1887989b9436fe6b","title":"twenty tech trends for 2020 tesla cybertruck iphone 12 5g nintendo vr ai amazon","story":"From new gaming consoles to activism at Apple, we predict the things you will – or won’t – see in tech this yearThis is an easy prediction to make, because even Tesla isn’t claiming that its eye-catching angular steel beast will be available for sale in 2020. The company’s own pitch is that production won’t even begin until 2021, with owners receiving their first shipments in 2022. But the gap is relevant to Tesla’s future: where the company was once genuinely ahead of the curve, in making beautiful electric cars that people wanted to buy, it has increasingly relied on beating its competitors to announcements, rather than actually shipping. The list of Elon Musk’s as-yet-unfulfilled promises grows every year – but the electric fleets of BMW, Ford, General Motors and others grow faster.One of the most impressive, and futuristic, products to have come from Google in recent years, Duplex is an AI assistant that can make calls to local businesses on your behalf to do things like book appointments and find out opening times. The tool was criticised when the company first revealed it, for being so good that its use could plausibly be described as “deceptive”: the AI assistant even injects “um” and “er” into speech to sound more human. That, combined with the difficulties of gaining consent for receiving an automated cold call, means that GDPR might well keep the technology from European shores for years to come.For Brits, 5G is technically here already, with multiple networks offering the ultrafast mobile standard in denser urban areas. But there are few devices that support the new standard yet – and fewer still that are acceptable to the gadget-obsessed early adopters who would otherwise be first on board, since the flagship devices from manufacturers such as Samsung, Google and Apple continue to be 4G only. That will change in 2020, when you can expect hardware like the Pixel 5, iPhone 12 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S11 to support the faster connections.It’s been years since any consumer app broke through into the mainstream – with an honourable exception for TikTok among the under-25s – and that trend shows no real sign of curving upwards in 2020. Between the dominance of default apps from Apple and Google, and the ability of the major platforms to acquire, clone or kill upstart competitors, it’s a hard time to be a consumer software company. Harder still to become one of the 28 who get a coveted spot on a typical user’s homescreen, rather than being buried in a folder.It was always hubristic for Facebook to release an Echo competitor. The company had no real expertise in building hardware, nor an obvious strategy for getting its products to market: it may own the world’s most valuable advertising real estate, but it’s not a store. Then Cambridge Analytica broke, and Portal went from a bold idea to a bad one. Who would want to put an always-on microphone connected directly to Menlo Park in their homes? The answer, it seems, is “not many people”, because Portal sales have reportedly been minuscule. A second iteration was squeezed out earlier this year don’t expect a third.Virtual reality has been the “next big thing” for five years, and has been a big thing for precisely none of those. But just when it was on its way out, there’s the potential for one last flurry of attention, thanks to the work of PC gaming company Valve. The company announced a new edition of its beloved Half-Life series, the first since 2007, would be exclusive to its VR headset. There have been few titles that can encourage non-believers to spend the thousands required to get high-quality VR at home, but Half-Life: Alyx is one. Whether it sparks a lasting resurgence, or just a final flash in the pan, remains to be seen.Alexa has been coming to new products at an impressive clip. Amazon has incorporated its voice assistant into almost every gadget it makes, and a good few it doesn’t. But, even though voice assistants remain popular among their devotees, privacy concerns are only growing among the cohort of refuseniks who want nothing to do with always-on microphones. If Ford, for instance, starts losing out on sales because of an overly ambitious plan to put Alexa in everything, you can be certain they’ll reassess that integration rapidly.The two worst-kept secrets in technology are Apple’s biggest experimental projects: a pair of augmented-reality glasses and a self-driving car, both being developed in Cupertino. The glasses have a path to release, and references to them in the code for Apple products have started showing up in beta tests and other leaks. The car, for now, has no existence outside of a few offices in Sunnyvale and some suspicious hires from companies like Tesla. But, at the earliest, the glasses won’t hit shelves until 2021, and Apple is always wary about pre-announcing things.Video gaming has been quiet for the past few years. With Xbox Ones and PlayStation 4s in houses across the nation, Microsoft and Sony turned their attention to intra-generational upgrades and cheaper models designed to be a second console. Nintendo took a different path, releasing the Switch and upending what a home console could be. And Fortnite rendered the whole thing moot anyway, as the most popular game in the world worked on every console, PCs, and even mobile phones. But 2020 will see the launch of a new Xbox, a new Playstation, a new Halo and a new Last of Us – and the return to playgrounds nationwide of tiresome debates about which is better.While the European Union was hammering out the details of 2019’s copyright directive, Google began one of its largest lobbying efforts to date. The company was incensed by two proposals – articles 13 and 15 of the draft bill – which it dubbed the “upload filter” and the “link tax”. Passage of the directive, it implied, could result in the end of YouTube in Europe for good. It mobilised thousands of YouTubers in opposition, and sparked group hysteria among tween fandoms on Instagram and elsewhere. While inidual nations ratify the legislation, expect more protest and legal challenges, but ultimately Google may gain from article 13: after all, they are well placed to build and license the content filters required to police copyrighted material.Simon Shooter, a partner at law firm Bird \u0026amp Bird, predicts that 2020 will see “the escalation of the cyberwar, with AI in use on both sides of the ide”. Hackers have long been experimenting with automatic tools for breaking into and exploiting corporate and government networks, but the need to stay undetectable has limited the use of AI in practice. As the cyber cold war heats up, however, that could change.The rise of TikTok may have concerned the adults in the room, who see the company’s role in exporting Beijing’s censorship and slow adoption of child protection standards as reasons for caution. But among the younger generation, it could have the opposite effect, cementing a perception of China as the home of cool products and services. Who would win if that happened? “The success of TikTok will not have gone unnoticed by Tencent, which owns WeChat,” says Tamara Littleton, CEO at social media agency the Social Element. “It has struggled to gain traction in other countries… but I predict they will make a play for the UK and US audience with a slightly tailored version.”The only people with the power to change how Silicon Valley works are inside Silicon Valley. Employee activism burst through in a big way in 2018, with Google workers walking out over sexual harassment and plans to open up a censored search engine in China, Microsoft workers campaigning against working with the US Department of Defense and Amazon workers joining in protests against working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Apple, the largest of them all, has so far kept its staff from expressing public dissent. Whether that’s through the carrot or the stick is unknown – but with the company coming under increasing pressure for its craven stance towards both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, it surely cannot last.Both Apple and Google launched their screen time controls in 2018, and upgraded them this year. Ross Sleight, chief strategy officer at tech accelerator Somo, thinks this trend will continue – and will start to impact on regulation. “Many people are now very aware of their addictive habits and are trying to disengage,” he says. “A shared responsibility for wellbeing falls on to each one of us: the companies designing applications and user interfaces that play on our psychology, but also on policy makers.” How that would look in practice is likely to be the result of years of legal wrangling – but watch the proposals bubble up over the next year.Loot boxes, treasure crates, card packs – whatever they’re called, the practice of offering randomised rewards for real money has gained an increasingly bad reputation. Stories of children spending hundreds of pounds of their parents money – and adults spending thousands of pounds of their own – back up the perception of the offerings as closer to unregulated gambling than a fun aspect of video games in the 21st century. Self-regulation might be on the cards if the industry showed the slightest interest in doing it, but the billions it rakes in from the practice (Fifa loot boxes resulted in more than half of EA’s 2017 revenue from game add-ons) makes a voluntary change unlikely.In the past decade, hundreds of small sites were launched with venture capital cash, riding a wave of social media distribution and programmatic adverts to a peak of bubbly excess, before it burst in 2016 and they dropped like flies. In the US, consolidation has seen some outlets close, others merge, and still more lay off hundreds of employees in total, and the trend shows no sign of abating. The biggest scalps have already been claimed, but 2020 could be a time when smaller sites start to lose out, like the hyper-partisan news outlets that so shaped the 2017 election, or the few remaining independent blogs that have eked out a living on reader support and savings.The smartphone industry seems to be following the trend set by Gillette and one-upping itself on an annual basis. Other phones already have four cameras, so why not Apple? The company would have a good reason for adding another lens: while the iPhone 11 Pro is perhaps the best smartphone camera on the market, it falls far short in one specific area, with just a 2x optical zoom at the highest level. So a bigger zoom lens would be well received by any users who like shooting big things far away or small things nearby.The online harms white paper, revealed in a blaze of publicity in the summer of 2019, has gone nowhere. The prime minister who commissioned it is out, as is the culture secretary who launched it. Whoever sits at the head of cabinet in 2020 is unlikely to want to progress this odd legislation, assembled as it is from a mishmash of -pleasing statements about harmful but not illegal speech. And they’re unlikely to have the parliamentary time to do so even if they did want to. So instead, everyone will continue to talk about how much we need to update our laws, while doing nothing of the sort.

New Year’s Day, 11pm, BBC TwoA Christmas CarolPeaky Blinders writer Steven Knight gives Dickens’s parable a pitch-dark psychological backstory and lashings of starkly unfestive language, in a confrontational three-part rendering. Guy Pearce is Ebenezer Scrooge, a chillingly recognisable picture of a soul ingrained with meanness and cruelty. Andy Serkis is one of the admonishing spirits, with Stephen Graham as the avenging ghost of Marley. Viewers expecting a cosy Yuletide story could be in for a shock.

Saturday 28 December, 9.20pm, BBC TwoThe Repair Shop at ChristmasGoodness, this show is lovely enough without it being Christmas as well.

Christmas Day, 7.30am, 8pm, 4.20am, Sky Cinema PremiereFinding DoryAnother animated undersea search for a lost fish? This sequel is pretty much a rerun of Finding Nemo, but it is done with such vibrant beauty and soppy charm that it can easily be forgiven. Here, the amnesiac Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) sets out on a quest to find her family, while chums Nemo and Marlin in turn go looking for her. Christmas Day, 3.10pm, BBC OneThe OthersA distinctly chilly and unsettling horror story, this.

We followed every moment of Strictly’s sparkling Saturday night spectacularAnd that’s the end of another Strictly – it’s been great fun, and as always made all the better by the incredible community in the comments. It’s been many years in the making with newcomers joining every year, and it feels like a very special corner of the internet. You are all amazing, and I hugely appreciate your wit and wisdom every week. A massive thank you to everyone. That’s me done with liveblogging for 2019, but as usual we’ll open a blog on Christmas Day for the Strictly Christmas Special so you can put the comment box to good use. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you’d like to swing by and say hello (or goodbye).Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy 2020 – see you next September for another spin around the Strictly dancefloor. Keeeeeep dancing!The series plays out to ‘We Are Family’ with Kelvin on Graziano’s shoulders, which is a workout he may regret later. Everyone’s crying, there’s flooding in Elstree. Aside from Kelvin am delighted for Oti, a glitterball win has been a long time coming. Oh thank goodness it’s time for the results. So much tension. And the winners of this year’s Strictly Come Dancing are…KELVIN AND OTI.Well, I don’t think that’s a huge surprise, and on the night they were my favourite. But all tonight’s performances were pretty special, my favourite final in years.Time for a final word from our judges, featuring a montage (drink). FOR THE LOVE OF DANCE JUST CROWN A WINNER. Love Claudia to Dev: ‘You left too soon and we’re still grumpy about it’. YES WE ARE. Time for a final dance from our Strictly stars – James Cracknell literally stands there with an arm out, human canoe 4eva. Nice to see Dev back, and Johannes and Catherine were good times. Great to see Will back on the dancefloor, with everyone dancing round him holding table tennis bats. Out comes Michelle for some final vogueing, and Saffron is giving it all the hair. Chris and Karen do a final bit of Uptown Funk, and that was all rather joyful. What a fab line-up this year, I’ve really enjoyed this series. If this montage goes on much longer we’ll be seeing in the New Year. The voting is closed! Time for a montage from all this year’s competitors, including the ones we’ve all forgotten about. DRINK. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of megastar pop royalty Taylor Swift. She’s singing ‘Lover’ from her number one album, wearing one of Tess’s bacofoil cast-offs. It’s a Christmas song, but it’s really quiet. Maybe that’s how Tay likes her Christmas. On the upside, no out-of-time audience clapping. I like to think Taylor demanded it in the contract. Dance-wise, it’s Aljaz and Janette looking dreamy, accompanied by AJ and Dianne and Graziano and Luba. Graziano’s trousers are unfeasibly tight. The dancing is over but there are still 40 minutes to go, so it’s time to wheel out the filler. First up, the general public and a recap of their favourite bits. DRINK.Also spot the famouses, just spotted the lovely Marian Keyes saying nice things about Motsi, and Mel Giedroyc loved Michelle’s Blackpool Vogue. Scores: 9,10,10,10 – a total of 39 for Kelvin and Oti. But none of this matters, because the judges’ scores mean NOTHING this evening. Shirley is speechless, there are no bits of Kelvin’s body that don’t move. Bruno thought Kelvin’s bum and hips were mesmerising, it was the crowning glory of a great night. Craig had a small problem with the bounce, but it was a brave choice to dance a Rumba and a Samba in the final and Kelvin smashed it. Motsi points out that this series has been death by Samba, but Kelvin put his heart on the dancefloor.

papers detail us dysfunction we did not know what we were doing","story":"A key theme of the trove of documents published this week was the lack of coherence in Washington’s approach to Afghanistan from the outsetIn the midst of Barack Obama’s much-vaunted military surge against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2010, Hayam Mohammed, an elder from Panjwai near the Pakistani border confronted an officer from the US 101st Airborne who had come into his village.That surge, which like so many other initiatives in Afghanistan’s long war was celebrated as a huge success, today serves only as a grim reminder of the deception and failure revealed in the explosive Afghanistan papers published by the Washington Post this week.Like that secret history, the Afghanistan Papers’ accumulated oral history depicts a war mired in failure – in sharp contrast to the “misleading” story told to the US and British publics by officials in massaged figures and over-optimistic assessments.But even if that deception has been the main focus of reporting, the hundreds of interviews – with senior generals and Afghan governors, with ambassadors, aid officials and policy advisers – also tell another story: how successive presidents from Bush through Obama to Donald Trump, publicly rejected “nation-building” but created a violent, corrupt and dysfunctional state only barely propped up by US arms.They detail too how – like the Soviet Union before them – the US and its allies came so badly unstuck in Afghanistan through a combination of hubris and ignorance, and with a political leadership – both under Obama and Bush – more concerned with domestic politics than the impact of their decisions on Afghanistan.Reading at times like an extended exercise in blame, the interviews trace a widespread desire among participants to nail down an original sin for the failures in Afghanistan even to seek an exculpation for a conflict that has cost $1tn and the lives of tens of thousands over almost 20 years.From the shortcomings of the US military’s newly rewritten counter-insurgency doctrine – described by one interviewee as “colonial” in its conceit – to a tolerance of widespread corruption and “warlordism” blamed for fueling the resurgence of the Taliban, a key theme of many of those who spoke to Sigar was the lack of coherence in Washington’s approach to Afghanistan from the outset.From the very beginning, as Richard Haas – the former US government policy coordinator for Afghanistan – confided in his interview, there was little enthusiasm in George W Bush’s White House for the country once the Taliban was driven out in 2001.Other interviewee subjects, however, place the initial failure even further back: with the original decision to elide the Taliban with Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida in the wake of the September 11 attacks.Among people like Jeffrey Eggers, a former US Navy Seal and staffer on the National Security Council in the George Bush and Obama administrations, this the key point.For Richard Boucher, assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs between 2006 and 2009, the contradictions in the aims framed a mission that appeared founded on impossibility.“If we think our exit strategy is to either beat the Taliban – which can’t be done given the local, regional, and cross border circumstances – or to establish an Afghan government that is capable of delivering good government to its citizens using American tools and methods, then we do not have an exit strategy because both of those are impossible.”His summation, however, was even more scathing: “We did not know what we were doing.”The lack of vision at the war’s start, which left the US and its allies racing to catch up as US attention turned quickly to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was only exacerbated by the decisions that would belatedly get made in response to the rapidly resurgent Taliban in the middle of the last decade.“Every nation was in charge of protecting an area larger than they had forces to do so with, and if you don’t have enough forces to protect what you’re trying to do, stabilization can’t be done.”“No inidual is to blame,” he added bleakly: “The system let everyone down.”But if there is one issue with the Afghanistan papers, however, it is that they represent the views of a selection of insiders who were at one time or another invested in the success of the war, often unable to step outside the sometimes arcane disagreements they were steeped in.Austin Wright, an academic who specialises in Afghanistan at the University of Chicago, and has made a study of the declassified military records of the war, offers an outsider’s perspective from his reading of the interviews.Wright notes that many in the media have picked up on the acknowledgment by the head of Sigar, John J Sopko, asserting the US public was “misled” consistently by official accounting of progress of the war. But he believes that focus misses the fact that many in leadership positions also misinterpreted their own data concerning the nature, intentions and capabilities of the Taliban at key points in the conflict in their desire to see signs of victory.Wright points to US military and Nato surveys that indicated that at key points, including after their initial defeat, the Taliban simply withdrew either to regroup or instill a false sense of progress, echoing the observation made by village elder Hayam Mohammed at the height of the 2010 surge.“The Taliban are strategic and patient,” says Wright. “They are also skillful at manipulating the information being seen in the field to maximise any political process.“What you see – during the Obama era handover of leadership to Afghan forces for example – is a significant reduction in violence across large areas where there are foreign forces. But what the survey data also showed was a continuing Taliban presence, not necessarily fighting but not going away.“Then, when you see the actual physical withdrawal of US troops, you see an increase in violence again. What that tells you is that they have been sitting it out to until the cost of re-intervention becomes too high.”The sense of overdue re-evaluation is not confined to just those interviewed by Sigar but shared by many who served in senior roles in Afghanistan.“I remember thinking at the time I was running around Helmand that we should be able to do this, whatever that thing was,” a former British diplomat who served in the region told the Observer.“But in retrospect, it was not realistic because while we were pissing into sand in Helmand you have to look at bigger picture.“And by the time people realised that the Taliban were coming back it was too late.”A very reasonable question was what would have happened if the international community had delivered the investment and committed the resources in 2003-04 that were delivered 2008-10.The diplomat responds to a point made by Gen Dan McNeill, the former US and Nato commander in Afghanistan, Dan McNeill, who in his interview with Sigar complained that even before his first deployment in 2002 he could not find anyone able to give him a definition of what “winning meant”.“If you can’t define ‘winnable’ how do you define if the war is lost. What is clear,” he added looking to the future, “is that there is going to be an ongoing low level of commitment for a long time to come in terms training and in terms of trying to prevent Afghanistan becoming a serious problem again.“You can argue that you are preventing Afghanistan being used as an operational base for the really bad guys, but then there are plenty of other options for them. In terms of what we were trying to achieve does that mean loss?” He thinks for a moment.“It probably does. Certainly we took a bloody nose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ec04569cf63769582aa6846a3056036f361dfa/0_45_4111_2467/master/4111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98360ba839cd497c15f28b9929fd1572","title":"wisconsin purge voter rolls judge ruling","story":"A Wisconsin judge’s order to boot more than 200,000 people from voter rolls in the battleground state spurred condemnation from Democrats, amid claims of voter suppression.If the decision stands, it could have an impact on the 2020 presidential election. In 2016, Donald Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes. Subsequent contests have also returned tight margins.“I won the race for governor by less than 30,000 votes,” tweeted Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat who beat the former Republican presidential hopeful Scott Walker last year.“This move pushed by Republicans to remove 200,000 Wisconsinites from the voter rolls is just another attempt at overriding the will of the people and stifling the democratic process.“Voting is a fundamental right, and we should be making it easier for folks to vote, not harder. It’s time for Republicans to move on from the election we had more than a year ago and start working on the pressing issues facing our state.”In October, the Wisconsin Elections Commission mailed a letter to 234,000 voters who it thought might have moved, requesting that they update registration information.As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, the Wisconsin Institute for Law \u0026amp Liberty (Will), a conservative group, then filed suit.The lawsuit said the voters contacted should have 30 days to confirm their addresses. If they did not do so, Will said, their registration status should be changed from “eligible” to “ineligible”.Will asked county circuit judge Paul Malloy to grant an injunction that would require election authorities to purge the rolls. In his ruling on Friday, Malloy identified a legal obligation to strip the rolls in 30 days.Will’s president, Rick Esenberg, said: “This case is about whether a state agency can ignore clearly written state law. Today’s court order requires the Wisconsin Elections Commission to follow state law, and we look forward to making the case that they must continue to follow state law.”Voting authorities and the League of Women Voters indicated they would fight the decision, which Malloy refused to stay pending appeals.Eric Holder, US attorney general under Barack Obama, commented on Twitter.“Here they go,” he said. “Voter purge in Wisconsin that disproportionately targets Democrats, people of color and those who voted for Hillary in 2016. The expected unfairness. Fight this Wisconsin! Fight for a fair election.”Ben Wikler, chair of the state Democratic party, criticized the decision and called for action, writing: “A rightwing lawsuit triggered a 200,000-voter purge in Wisconsin yesterday. But we still have same-day registration in this state. So now our job is to organize harder than they can suppress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75cf1910f6b4dbae980abf5a4a94cb6b01e7ec28/38_0_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18fd0500fefa6a4c9490a156e1021e73","title":"north korea test long range rocket site","story":"Pyongyang continues to pressurise Trump administration for concessionsNorth Korea has said it successfully performed another “crucial test” at its long-range rocket launch site that it claims will further strengthen its nuclear deterrent.The test may have included technologies to improve intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) which could potentially reach the continental US.The announcement, on Saturday, comes as North Korea continues to press the Trump administration for significant concessions as it approaches an end-of-year deadline set by its leader, Kim Jong-un, to salvage faltering nuclear negotiations.North Korea’s Academy of Defence Science did not specify what had been tested on Friday. Days earlier, the North said it had conducted a “very important test” at the site, on the country’s north-western coast, prompting speculation that it involved a new engine for either an ICBM or a space launch vehicle.The announcement suggests that the country is preparing to do something to provoke the US if Washington does not back down and make concessions to ease sanctions and pressure on Pyongyang in deadlocked nuclear negotiations.An unnamed spokesman for the academy said scientists received warm congratulations from members from the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea central committee which attended the test, carried out between 10.41 pm and 10.48pm on Friday at the Sohae satellite launching ground, where the North has conducted satellite launches and liquid-fuel missile engine tests in recent years.The spokesman said the successful outcome of the latest test, in addition to one on 7 December, would be applied “to further bolster up the reliable strategic nuclear deterrent of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”, referring to North Korea’s formal name.Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military officer and an analyst at Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the North mentioning its nuclear deterrent made it clear it had tested a new engine for an ICBM, not a satellite-launch vehicle. Kim said it was notable that North Korea announced the specific length of the test, which he said possibly signalled a larger, liquid-fuel ICBM engine.North Korea’s current ICBMs, including the Hwasong-15, are built with first stages powered by a pair of engines that experts say are modelled after Russian designs. When the North first tested the engine in 2016, it said the test lasted for 200 seconds and demonstrated a thrust of 80 tons-force.During a provocative run of weapons tests in 2017, Kim Jong-un conducted three flight tests of ICBMs that demonstrated potential range to reach deep into the US mainland, raising tensions and triggering verbal warfare with Donald Trump as they exchanged crude insults and threats of nuclear annihilation. Experts say the North still needs to improve the missiles, such as ensuring that their warheads survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry, for them to be considered a viable threat.Relations between Kim and Trump thawed in 2018 after Kim initiated diplomacy that led to their first summit in June that year in Singapore, where they issued a vague statement on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, without describing when or how it would occur.Negotiations faltered after the US rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief, in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities, at Kim’s second summit with Trump, in Vietnam, in February.Trump and Kim met for a third time in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. However, an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what Pyongyang described as Washington’s “old stance and attitude”.Kim, who unilaterally suspended nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests last year during talks with Washington and Seoul, has said North Korea could seek a “new path” if the US persisted with sanctions and pressure against the North.North Korea has also conducted 13 rounds of ballistic missile and rocket artillery tests since May, and has hinted at lifting its moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests if the Trump administration failed to make substantial concessions before the new year.Some experts doubt that Kim would revive the tensions of 2017 by restarting nuclear and ICBM tests, which would cross a metaphorical “red line” and risk shattering his hard-won diplomacy with Washington. They say Kim is likely to pressurise Trump with military activities that pose less of a direct threat to the US and by bolstering a united front with Beijing and Moscow. Both are the North’s allies and have called for the UN security council to consider easing sanctions on Pyongyang to help nuclear negotiations move forward."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4114663.1576255332!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says bare bones trade deal may replace no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar  in Brussels on Friday. The Taoiseach said Boris Johnson had a ‘very strong personal mandate. . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.’ Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said a “bare bones” trade agreement between the EU and the UK may be possible late next year if a full trade agreement cannot be negotiated in time, as most EU leaders expect.EU leaders attending the summit in Brussels acknowledged that the UK would now leave the EU in January, but most do not believe a trade agreement can be agreed before the transition period ends next December – raising the prospect of another “cliff edge” in 12 months’ time.However, speaking to journalists after the conclusion of the summit, Mr Varadkar said it “may be possible to put together some kind of bare bones agreement to cover some aspects of it”.He said this would “not be ‘no deal’ in the sense that we used to talk about no deal” because of the guarantees in the withdrawal agreement.Earlier, Mr Varadkar warned against moves towards a united Ireland in the wake of Northern Ireland result, which saw unionist losses and gains for nationalists and the Alliance Party.Mr Varadkar said while the “tectonic plates” were shifting in the North, the focus should be reviving the powersharing institutions, rather than pushing for a united Ireland.PowersharingHe said there was now “no unionist majority, no nationalist majority and an ever-expanding centre ground”.He added: “The one thing that hasn’t changed for Northern Ireland is that the best future for Northern Ireland is one based on powersharing and one based on reconciliation, one based on bringing all communities together. And the next step in that has to be getting the Executive and Assembly up and running before January 13th.”On Brexit, Mr Varadkar said that he agreed with French president Emmanuel Macron who told the council meeting there should be “no quotas, no tariffs and no dumping” – referring to the need for the UK to uphold European standards of worker protection and product standards if it was to benefit from open access to the European market.“That’s the kind of space we’re in as the European Union,” Mr Varadkar said.Asked “which Boris will turn up” at talks, Mr Varadkar said he had met Mr Johnson on a few occasions and they had spoken a lot on the phone “but I certainly can’t read his mind, nor do I know his mind”. “But if I had to guess, I think he is somebody who is an economic and social liberal. And he’s somebody who is going to want to have a close relationship with the European Union, and will want us to have a trade deal as close and also a future relationship that goes beyond trade into an economic partnership, citizens rights and also a political partnership too. But that all remains to be seen.”He added that Mr Johnson had a “very strong personal mandate . . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.”‘Absolute caveat’Mr Varadkar said Ireland would be an advocate in Europe for the UK to have a close economic and political relationship with the EU – “but with the absolute caveat that it can never undermine the European Union”.“We’re in a different place and we’re in a more vulnerable place in a lot of ways, so we need to maintain our place at the centre of the European Union – but also we need to maintain a close relationship with our nearest neighbour. So that’s going to be a challenge, but I think it’s one we can navigate,” he said. Mr Varadkar said EU leaders in their private discussions had stressed the importance of maintaining unity among the EU member states behind chef negotiator Michel Barnier’s task force.The Taoiseach said that would be difficult because the interests of EU countries would erge in the trade talks. “So we need to stick together and we need to maintain solidarity and unity, and that’s what we intend to do.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4115776.1576327921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar way to investigate dara murphy s attendance must be found","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar pictured on the RTÉ Radio 1’s Marian Finucane Show with Brendan O’Connor. Photograph: Andres PovedaRTÉTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said an independent person may be appointed to investigated Dara Murphy’s Dáil attendance record and expenses.“That’s something that isn’t entirely under my control if he was still a member of the house he could be investigated by the house ethics committee, apparently because he isn’t a member of the house, that can’t be done.”“We need to find an alternative option, we might be able to appoint an independent person to examine it,” he said.Mr Murphy has been criticised for claiming full parliamentary and travel allowances of €4,300 per month despite spending much of the last two years working in Brussels as campaign manager for the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping to which Fine Gael is aligned.Mr Murphy resigned as a TD on December 3rd, hours after the Government won a no-confidence vote in Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy.The former Cork North Central TD has taken up a new full-time post as deputy head of cabinet for Bulgarian EU commissioner Mariya Gabriel in December.The datelines of Mr Murphy’s tweets suggest he was in locations such as Malta, Warsaw, Brussels and Paris on days he signed in on the Dáil electronic fobbing system.This suggests he recorded his attendance on the fobbing system either after flying back from or before flying out to those destinations.Speaking on Saturday, Mr Varadkar said although he had been aware Mr Murphy had taken up a new role as campaign manager for the EPP, he did not officially sanction it.Mr Varadkar said “if it’s found he’s broken the rules, he should pay the money back”.Mr Varadkar also said Mr Murphy was not at the bottom of the list when it came to turning up for votes.Sincere apology The Taoiseach also criticised a controversial campaign video released by Verona Murphy, the Fine Gael candidate in last month’s Wexford by-election, which suggested she had been the victim of a campaign of character assassination by the media.Ms Murphy made, and then withdrew and apologised for, comments about asylum seekers being linked to Islamic State and suggested they may need “de-programming”.Asked why he had canvassed with Ms Murphy following these comments, Mr Varadkar said she had apologised and withdrawn them.However, he added: “What was done subsequently in terms of the video she did which sort of tried to imply the whole thing was a media character assassination attempt on her - I had a big problem with that because maybe it suggested to me that the apology and retraction wasn’t fully sincere.” He said Ms Murphy had been vetted prior to her selection as a candidate and would have had mock media interviews where questions on issues like direct provision would have been asked “and that wasn’t the answer given”.He said her future in the party was not yet decided and that a process would be followed, but added that lapses in ethical standards in Fine Gael had been punished before by removal from the ticket.Brexit The Taoiseach said he spoke to the recently re-elected UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, by phone Friday night, and the pair agreed that talks on the future of the Stormont executive should be restarted next week with a view to having an executive and assembly in place by the end of January.He said Mr Johnson is “is the guy you see on TV, witty and intelligent, on occasion a little bit eccentric, but somebody who at least so far is someone I felt I could meet and deal with and has been honourable in any agreements we have come to or any understandings we had”. The Taoiseach said he believed Brexit would happen on January 31st, and said the European Union would seek a close relationship with the UK, albeit not one that could lead to standards being undermined.“We must have common minimum standards . . . we’re not going to agree to that if you’re going to try and undercut us on health and safety, on labour rights, on environmental protections,” he said.He said now is not the time for a Border poll. “I think that’s the wrong approach now for Norther Ireland given there is not a nationalist majority in Northern Ireland . . . It would probably be defeated, it would probably be very isive.” Instead, he argued that all parties should recommit to the Belfast Agreement."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Anne Sacoolas, Harry Dunn crash suspect, pictured back behind the wheelStrictly Come Dancing 2019, grand final live: high-scoring, tear-stained finale sees favourites Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse lift glitterball trophyCaroline Flack\u0026#39s boyfriend Lewis Burton posts picture of them on Instagram after she was charged with assaultStrictly Come Dancing 2019: the Final - who danced it best?

There’s been other techniques to combine the two in the past but they don’t end up with pictures that are nice to look at.”Spectral Edge is the second acquisition of a UK startup\u0026nbspfor Apple this year, following the takeover of digital marketing startup DataTiger\u0026nbspin February.The technology giant will be hoping the latest buyout can offer a critical edge over competitors when it comes to camera performance, which has become one of the key differentiators between high-end smartphones in recent years.Apple is not expected to release a new iPhone until September 2020, meaning there is plenty of time to integrate Spectral Edge’s technology into its devices.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After crashing back down to $175, it then went on another positive run in 2017 that took it close to $20,000 by the end of that year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince then, bitcoin has tumbled once more, reaching below $4,000 at the start of 2019 before recovering to today’s price of around $7,000. (At the time of his arrest six years ago, the FBI seized 144,000 bitcoins from Silk Road and\u0026nbspUlbricht\u0026nbsp- worth just over $1 billion at current prices.)Ulbricht\u0026nbspclaims he predicted both of these waves from his prison cell and believes another one is already building – a prediction he says he is able to make without being swayed by day-to-day price movements and general market hubris his imprisonment shelters him from.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIn a six-part blog published from letters he wrote in\u0026nbspprison, Ulbricht\u0026nbspapplied a form of market analysis known as Elliott Wave Theory to predict new all-time highs for bitcoin.The theory forecasts the highs and lows in financial market cycles by identifying extremes in investor psychology, which in the case of bitcoin appear to be far more tempormental compared to traditional markets due to the nacency of the cryptocurrency.The principle posits that price movements in speculative markets are driven by investor expectation, which when combined with mass psychology can force prices artificially higher through a positive feedback loop of buyer optimism.Looking at the previous price waves of bitcoin, Ulbricht puts the next big wave reaching between $93,000 and $109,000 before the 17 February, 2021. He notes that his speculation should be considered with appropriate scepticism.“We have a price target... of ~$100,000 some time in or near 2020,” he wrote. “However, there is no rule that market moves have to be proportional. This is just a patter we see unfolding that may or may not continue.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Christmas special so wrong, it must be from comedians Porta dos Fundos.At the time of writing, 1,509,329 people have signed a petition against the programme.Created with Sketch.Best comedy shows on Netflix Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again. New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Trust has repeatedly criticised the five-week delay in first receiving benefits when people are moved onto the Universal Credit system in particular.When the Foodbank app was launched in 2014 it said 40 local foodbanks had signed up to take part, but it is not clear how many are using it today.The Foodbank app is not the only similar service available to local charities, and nor is it the only service which charges inidual foodbanks.Any foodbank which joins the Trussell Trust’s own network has to pay a joining fee of £1,500 and then £360 a year after that.The Trust says this helps towards the costs of delivering their services to foodbanks, including £1.3m-worth of funding in 2018.Ms Cates\u0026nbspand the Conservative Party did not respond to requests for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We can move to a fairer system, restoring trust in politics and building a better democracy at the same time.”Election analysis also shows more than half of voters backed pro-referendum parties at the polls.Nearly 52 per cent supported parties in favour of a second referendum, compared with 47 per cent who supported Brexit-backing parties, such as the Tories, the DUP and Mr Farage’s outfit.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Let’s see what happens to the Labour Party now.”If Labour does not learn the lessons from the rejection of Corbyn’s left-wing agenda by the electorate, Lib Dems will be ready to offer “that centre-left reformist party which people who believe in social justice and public service and internationalist politics can feel comfortable in joining”, he said.And he said that Johnson’s willingness to risk economic prosperity and the future of the UK for the sake of Brexit meant Lib Dems can hope to attract more of the traditional Tory voters who took them close to taking seats like Esher and Walton on Thursday.“Given what Johnson is about to inflict on our country, there are still lots of people in commerce, in business, in finance in the Tory heartlands who can’t believe the Tory Party is now anti-business, anti-free trade, anti-market,” he said. “A lot of them will want to look to us.”He dismissed Mr Johnson’s promise to pursue a “One Nation” agenda at the head of a majority Tory government.“I don’t believe anything our prime minister says,” said Sir Ed. “I wish that wasn’t the case. I have respected and felt able to believe prime ministers from other parties throughout my life, but I can’t believe anything this prime minister says.“He talks about One Nation, but he has a deal which puts a border down the Irish Sea and he is pursuing policies which alienate Scottish people. If it is one nation Toryism to put the Union of the United Kingdom under threat, then we are in trouble.“I want to keep the UK together, but Brexit puts this amazing country in peril, and that’s what I fear more than anything.”Sir Ed – energy secretary in the coalition government of 2010-15 – said that as 2020 becomes mired in arguments over future trade and security relations with Europe, voters will quickly come to realise that Mr Johnson’s central election promise to “get Brexit done” was hollow.“Getting Brexit done isn’t about the withdrawal agreement, it’s about all the many other things which are yet to be done,” he said. “I think he is not going to be able to deliver on his promise.“Brexit could still implode. The prime minister has made a whole load of promises that are inconsistent, incoherent and probably undeliverable.”Rejecting Mr Johnson’s attack on parliament for supposedly imposing “gridlock” on the Brexit process, he said: “It’s completely legitimate for a party like the Lib Dems to point out the complexities and contradictions involved.“We want to make the case that Brexit is still going to be bad for the country, even if he has got a mandate to proceed with it. Our job is to speak for the people who voted for us and for the 48 per cent who voted to remain in the EU. Fifty-two per cent plus of those who voted on Thursday voted for parties which didn’t want Johnson’s Brexit to happen.”Despite Thursday’s comprehensive dashing of Lib Dem dreams of significantly increasing their numbers on the Commons green benches – or even installing Ms Swinson in Downing Street – Sir Ed was bullish about the party’s future.“My job at the moment is to get the party into the position where it can do its constitutional job to take forward the policies it stood on, and to be the opposition to this right-wing nationalist government,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We have got a Labour Party falling apart, ided, with its leading figures attacking each other. The country needs an opposition to stand up to the government and hold it to account. That’s what we will do.”Sir Ed said he had not yet spoken to Ms Swinson about her plans, but would like to have her back in the political frontline “as soon as possible”.He declined to join the chorus of criticism aimed at the former leader for her decision, viewed as undemocratic by some voters, to commit the party to revoking Brexit if it won office, saying that while he has voiced his opinions of the conduct of the Lib Dem campaign privately to the federal board, it would be wrong for him to “second guess” its judgement.Instead, he pointed the finger of blame for the party’s underperformance at Jeremy Corbyn, arguing that Lib Dems had ended up as “collateral damage” of the electorate’s dislike and distrust of the Labour leader.Voters who might have supported the Lib Dem agenda were scared off by the thought that they might inadvertently put Corbyn into 10 Downing Street, he said.“We underestimated the depth of the opposition to Jeremy Corbyn,” said Sir Ed. “I don’t think it was down to Brexit. We got washed up in a wider rejection of Corbyn and Labour.“The progressive Remain forces that were non-Labour, non-Corbyn became collateral damage. We weren’t powerful enough to withstand the squeeze and the Corbyn collapse. I think it would be the wrong conclusion to take that suddenly everyone wants Brexit.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen indicated that an agreement to be reached within Mr Johnson’s\u0026nbspdeadline of 31 December 2020 can only cover areas like goods, fisheries and security, with the vital services sector to be dealt with later.And the TUC warned that Mr Johnson must be ready to take his time to secure a deal which will support jobs and workplace protections in the northern and midlands seats which secured his stunning victory over Labour. The PM was carrying out post-election visits in the north on Saturday to assure voters of his determination to spread opportunity across the UK.Created with Sketch.

He said before the election that he wants to protect and enhance employment rights, but if you look at that withdrawal bill, it delivers none of those protections.”He added: “The government needs to now widen the conversation to include businesses, to include trade unions.“And I think our message clearly to Boris Johnson would be to put people before politics, to deliver a Brexit deal that does protect jobs and employment rights and I think that means getting a right deal not just a quick deal – and I think it does mean standing by the commitments he’s made to those voters in the northeast and in the midlands who may have voted for the first time.”Mr Nowak warned: “A deal that threatens jobs and people’s employment isn’t a deal that we can live with.”Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, a member of the European parliament’s Brexit Steering Group, said that a trade deal with zero tariffs would depend on whether the Conservative Party was able to “face up to its own contradictions”.Mr Lamberts said: “They want the deepest possible access to the European single market, yet they want to undercut significantly EU legislation, and you can’t have both.“So either you want total regulatory freedom and you do whatever you like – and if you want to undercut EU legislation then you do it, but then you lose access. Or you want access and you have basically to remain aligned with EU legislation, that will be the decision that Boris Johnson will need to make.”He added: “If the United Kingdom wants to retain full access, including for services, that will have the adverse consequence that it has to remain aligned to EU legislation in services as well, and I understand that some in the government would want to deviate from that quite significantly.”Mr Farage admitted that the influence on the prime minister of his Brexit Party and the European Research Group of backbench Tory Eurosceptics has “disappeared for the time being” as a result of Mr Johnson’s overwhelming victory.But he vowed to be “not too far away from the action” as the UK’s new relationship with the EU takes shape.Writing in The Daily , the architect of Brexit said: “Questions over the future shape of Brexit and Britain’s place in the world are now entirely in the hands of Johnson.“With half of his cabinet having voted Remain, and substantial global pressures on him, it will be tempting for him to pursue the easy option of a soft Brexit.“Whatever happens over the coming months, I will make sure I am not too far away from the action. The fact is that if Brexit does not ‘get done’, as Johnson has promised repeatedly over the last six weeks, pressure will have to be reapplied.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To clearly demonstrate that conversion therapy has no place in our society or civilization,” he said.Canadian politician Spencer Chandra Herbert echoed his remarks, tweeting: “Great to see the federal government has heard the loud request from LGBT+ Canadians, and many allies to ban conversion therapy in all provinces and territories across Canada.\u0026nbsp“I will work with the minister, and anyone else to see this horrible practice ended everywhere.”There are no official reports tracking conversion therapy in Canada, but figures\u0026nbspfor the US\u0026nbsppublished in 2018 as a whole show that nearly 700,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults had\u0026nbspreceived it.

Mr Steele told the Louisville Courier-Journal, which first reported the controversial pardoning. Two other men also convicted of involvement in the same death as Baker remain in prison.Mr Bevin wrote in the official order announcing Baker’s pardon that the evidence used to convict him was “sketchy at best”.He had made a “series of unwise decisions in his adult life”, Mr Bevin added, suggesting a drug problem had led to Baker falling in with the wrong crowd.Zombie TV shows among causes of mass shootings, Republican saysBut the judge who sentenced Baker in 2017, David Williams, said he had never seen a more “compelling or complete” case in his thirty years of experience. “The evidence was just overwhelming.”Mr Steele told the newspaper he believed the only reason Mr Bevin issued the pardon while leaving the two co-conspirators in prison was because Baker’s family had donated money to the governor. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also pardoned a man convicted of beheading a woman, a child rapist, a man who hired a hitman to murder his business partner in front of his family, and a woman who dumped her new-born child in a toilet septic tank.Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has condemned his fellow Republican. “Honestly, I don’t approve. It seems to me it was completely inappropriate,” Mr McConnell said when questioned by reporters about the slew of controversial pardons.“I expect he had the power to do it, but looking at the examples of people who were incarcerated as a result of heinous crimes — no, I don’t approve of it.”“What this governor did is an absolute atrocity of justice,” said Mr Steele. “He’s put victims, he’s put others in our community in danger.”Several senior Kentucky Democratic politicians have already written to the state’s incoming attorney general demanding a bipartisan special prosecutor be appointed to investigate the governor’s actions, and in particular the pardon for Baker.In response to the controversy, Mr Bevin told the Washington Post he was a “big believer in second chances”.“I think this is a nation that was founded on the concept of redemption and second chances and new pages in life.“If there has been a change and there’s no further value that comes for the inidual, for society, for the victims, for anybody, if a person continues to stay in, then that’s when somebody should be considered for a commutation or a pardon.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania.

And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.There are 258 million children and young people around the world with no access to education\u0026nbsp– 59 million at the primary level alone, according to Unesco’s Institute for Statistics.Today, poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education programmes. No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Australia, where intense wildfires have raged in recent weeks, was the subject of particular criticism for wanting to count over-performance in previous emission trading schemes towards future targets.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.On Saturday, a group of countries including the UK and vulnerable nations such as the Marshall Islands launched their own set of principles, which they said would lead to “fair and robust carbon markets” that would not allow double-counting or the reuse of old credits. More nations signed up to this as the day wore on.On the issue of loss and damage, countries that had historically emitted large amounts of carbon emissions were still resisting any financial deal that might open them up to future compensation claims. The US, which is due to leave the Paris Agreement next year, was particularly vocal on this issue.Sara Shaw, climate justice coordinator for Friends of the Earth International, said: “Here, we have witnessed the gutting of the already weak Paris Agreement, with the advance of dodgy carbon trading that will only exacerbate the climate crisis and harm southern communities. And we have seen a refusal by developed countries to pay up for loss and damage finance, while they try to introduce language that would remove their liability for the impacts their emissions have caused.”There was also major disappointment that countries would not be encouraged to submit more ambitious national carbon-cutting plans next year. Some nations, including China and India, have already stated that they see no need to improve their current plans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On Thursday, UN security officials blocked observers from entering the conference venue after Indigenous groups staged a sit-in protest.In a less eloquent move, Extinction Rebellion delivered a pile of horse manure to the conference venue.As the summit’s closing plenary was repeatedly pushed back on Saturday, a group of NGOs, trade unions and Indigenous groups held their own final meeting instead. Claiming to represent the majority of ordinary people outside the conference, they aimed to show what could have been delivered if the countries most historically responsible for the climate crisis and the biggest polluters “had not continued to advance their agendas”.Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said Chile, which had presided over the talks, had one job: “Protect the integrity of the Paris Agreement. And right now it is failing. It has listened to polluters, not the people.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They believe hard work pays off and want our borders protected. And they won’t stand for racism.I pleaded with Labour MPs to replace Corbyn with a decent leader.Imagine how dferent things could have beenthe charismatic Jess Phillips, Pat McFadden or Caroline Flint were leading the party.Instead, Corbyn and the zealots around him promoted people who were clearly not up to the job because they would toe the line.Labour MPs agreed with me in private. They knew Corbyn was unfit to lead but kept their heads down hoping the public would solve the problem.I am traditional Labour, but I knew I had to do all I could keep him out.People like Corbyn and McDonnell had spent their entire time in politics working with and defending extremists and in some cases terrorists and anti-Semites.I never thought they loved our country or could be trusted to defend it.Their economic policies would have chased away investment, putting businesses at risk and people out of work.And everyone knew the Brexit policy was a farce.Most shamefully, a party with a history of tackling racism was poisoned with anti-Jew hatred under Corbyn.Labour’s moderate MPs should show more courage than they managed in the past four years.First, they must kick Corbyn and the rest out and get a mainstream leader to axe the communists, cranks, racists and extremists.Second, they need to back a way through Brexit that brings the nation together.Third, get back on the side of the decent, patriotic majority with plans that back aspiration and reward effort, protect our borders and keep us safe.Who thought Corbyn could negotiate a decent deal and why would the EU give us onethey knew it would be put to another referendum Most ridiculous, he couldn’t even say which side he’d be on! But this is what happens when you treat voters with contempt.Two years ago they promised to uphold the result of the referendum and back a Brexit deal. But they did all they could to block Brexit.Easier said than done. The Marxist maniacs may have lost the election, but their main aim is to cling on to power. Many new MPs are more left-wing than their predecessors.Most Labour members have joined to back Corbyn too, so it’s hard to see how people who have not shown much fight so far can win back control.Butthey don’t, Labour’s heartlands will stay blue for decades.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way. Now we are told that the scariest stepmother since Cinderella’s has decided to buy her long-suffering family, including her -year-old mum, Botox vouchers for Christmas.Obviously there’s a money-making opportunity here, as Kris has signed up to promote a Botox company offering  gt tokens as seasonal presents.And I suppose eventhey are insulted or unhappy about her gt, they won’t be able to show those emotions on their newly frozen faces.So Kris wins again.I’M deeply concerned and extremely angry about the current mumps epidemic among hundreds of university students.Since this summer, more than , cases of this dangerous and infectious disease have been reported. If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks. Do Phillips and Wes Streeting really need five more years of this  We look forward to a bloodletting like this once-great party has never seen.“Change is coming”, Corbynistas used to say, with no little menace.It sure is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

rescuers searching the island in teams of two in a desperate bid to bring everyone home.They were seen wearing protective yellow suits and using breathing apparatus owing to the threat of toxic gases as they walk across the recently-erupted volcano.Aside from the volcanic risk, the wet weather in New Zealand is also a cause for concern for the recovery mission.Rain mixing with the heavy volcanic ash lying on the island could encase the bodies in a cement-like substance, making the recovery even more dficult.New Zealand authorities believe the force of the eruption resulted in one of the victims being knocked into the water.While the rescue team successfully recovered six bodies - all thought to be those of Australian tourists - the search is continuing for two more bodies, believed to be those of New Zealand tour guides.Authorities said one of those bodies was known to be in the water off the island, but was unable to be retrieved by ers on Friday.Deputy commissioner Mike Clement said there were nine ers in the water since  am today, working to a buddy system.He said:“We learned some stuff yesterday as a result of being on the island.The purpose of the planning day

Wrong.There are simply not that many avocado-munching Marxists in the country, comrade.Labour has spent years calling the .million people who voted to leave the European Union stupid, ­racist, pig-ignorant peasants.This is just in — calling people stupid is not a vote-winner.And now, this sorry excuse for a Labour Party has been given the apocalyptic kicking it so richly deserved.Under the extremist stewardship of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the brain-dead thugs of Momentum, Labour happily abandoned the working class. And now the working class has abandoned Labour. My guess — for ever.The North is blue. The Red Wall has fallen. Great Grimsby. Scunthorpe. Even Bolsover — home of Dennis Skinner, the erstwhile “Beast of Bolsover” — is Tory today.And Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton North East and Sedgefield — Tony Blair’s safe Labour seat for so many years — are sending Conservative MPs to Westminster.The great mystery is how Labour ever deluded itself that this country could embrace a party leader who has licked the grimy toenails of Hamas, Hezbollah, the IRA and indeed, it seems, any Brit-hating terrorist that would cheerfully do a jig on all our graves.This country will never elect a leader who openly despises the nation he seeks to represent. Why would we Labour — this jaw-droppingly out-of-touch Labour Party, this North London protest group masquerading as a serious political party — forgot why it was founded more than a century ago.And no, it wasn’t to represent a bunch of privately educated revolutionaries in Islington. It was to stand up for the working man and woman.Labour spat on the very people it was meant to represent. And now watch Labour choking on its own spit.Brexit — and the endless sneering at Brexit, and the thwarting of Brexit, and the endless attempts to abort Brexit — was just the start of Labour’s spectacular fall.Corbyn’s Labour never understood the working class.Hear this, comrade — the working class do not want handouts. They are not victims. They can’t be bought with glass beads, shiny trinkets and promises of free broadband.And they do not think they should apologise for being British and for loving this country and its history.All across our nation, working-class communities decided that the Conservatives were the true party of the working class.And let’s be honest, those Labour-voting heartlands have always had plenty of reasons to NOT vote Tory.Although Boris’s spectacular victory is being compared to Mrs Thatcher’s glory years, Maggie was always heartily despised in the regions where they built ships and mined for coal and did jobs where you got your hands dirty.For when these hard-working communities were tossed on the scrapheap of changing times, there seemed scant sympathy or understanding in Maggie Thatcher’s Conservative Party about the human cost of deindustrialisation.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the more low-paid, low-skilled workers living in a constituency, the better the Tories did.Think about it — the Tories are the party fighting for struggling families now.And their victory is so complete that the leaders of the two opposition parties, Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, have either resigned or are about to resign.These men and women in those post-industrial communities saw their families suffer dreadfully when the old industries died.They were never going to vote for Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist clowns.But getting them to actually break the habit of a letime and vote Tory signals an historic change in our politics.After this week, the old tribal party loyalties have gone for ever.It no longer matters a damn how your parents and your grandparents voted.Boris Johnson has been swept to power by millions who never voted Tory in their lives. Now he has to keep them.And he has to show he is a Prime Minister who understands that there is a country beyond the M.Brexit is just the start.The Prime Minister’s in-tray is piled high with the housing crisis, rising crime and communities across our nation that feel totally forgotten by Westminster. Brexit should have been done and dusted years ago.And the only reason it is not is because the establishment cynically thwarted the result of the  EU referendum.But all the yakking about revoking Article , and a second referendum, and arcane Parliamentary procedures, and cobblers about a “People’s Vote” is suddenly in the past.If Remainers want us to be members of the EU then they must now be prepared to campaign for decades.The Brexit debate is over and Boris Johnson has a mandate to reshape our country as a global nation that is open to trade with the world.Frankly, Boris’s election campaign was uninspired.Boris beat Corbyn the way that boxer Anthony Joshua beat roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabi — safety first, nothing fancy, just stay on the end of your jab and, above all, WIN. Because the consequences of losing were just too bloody awful to contemplate.Butthe campaign was uninspiring, Boris remains an inspirational politician.People like him. He gives them optimism and hope. He puts a smile on faces.His enemies paint him as a racist, right-wing bigot but the man is exactly the opposite.Boris is a tolerant, big-hearted, one-nation Tory with a razor-sharp mind and an endlessly generous spirit.The newspaper article that is always cited as evidence of his racism — the one where he compared women in full-body burkas to a letter box — was actually advocating their right to dress any way they choose, no matter how ridiculous it looks.There is no hatred in Boris Johnson. There is no poison. And God knows there has been a poisonous atmosphere in our politics for years.I live in an inner-city, safe Labour seat, and usually there would be the leaflets of three or four parties represented in the windows of our neighbourhood.But there were no leaflets in windows at this election. Because there is too much hatred abroad, too much toxic ision, too many idiots willing to stick a brick through the window of someone who dares to disagree with them.Whatever our beliefs, the great hope now must be that we can start coming together as a country, and begin to heal, and start building some kind of national unity.A Tory Prime Minister elected by the working class seems a good place to start.My parents — a Labour-voting mum and a Liberal-voting dad — despised the Tories as the party of the rich, the privileged, the out-of-touch toffs.That sentiment has been shared by millions of ­working-class men and women since the end of World War Two. Until now.From the Black Country to Blyth Valley, we are all Tories now.It is ironic that it took an Old Etonian Oxford graduateto make the Tories the natural party of the working class.And now Prime Minister Johnson and his new Tories must prove they are worthy of all those working-class votes.And let us hope that the Labour Party can find its soul again.Let us hope that this formerly great party of compassion, social justice and equality can kick out all the bigots, middle-class Reds, IRA groupies, friends of Hamas and Hezbollah and the anti-Semites who would rather wave the Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.But it is likely that ­Labour has already been dumped in the recycling bin of history.Because this doesn’t feel like a defeat for the Labour Party. It feels more like a death.It is hard to see how Labour can crawl out from under this landslide.These last years have not really been about party politics. They have been about the will of the people coming into direct conflict with the will of the establishment.The combined forces of the House of Commons and House of Lords, the BBC and Channel , the Supreme Court and expensive lawyers, RADA revolutionaries like Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, all placed themselves above people.All of the political paralysis, and the national humiliation of never getting Brexit done, and the endless frustration of seeing democracy being cheated stems from an arrogant establishment that refused to accept the largest vote for anything in our history.What a shameful, anti-democratic place this country would bethey had won. But they lost. Now let us move forward at last.Millions of working-class men and women just placed their faith in a decent, ­brilliant, chubby-cheeked, shaggy-haired, dog-loving toff to deliver a better tomorrow for ALL of our people.As unlikely as it seems, you are a working-class hero now, Boris.Andyou make your supporters proud to be working-class Tories, then you, Carrie and your dog Dilyn will be in No for the next ten years. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This party exists to represent them. We will earn their trust back.The petulant party leader had announced hell step down after leading Labour to its most humiliating election defeat since  - but refused to say when he would do so.He wrote in the Observer: I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate.But I regret that we did not succeed in converting that into a parliamentary majority for change.There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions.MPs and former ministers have been lining up to demand the hard-left leaders resignation after Boris Johnsons epic victory.But Labour big beasts tore into his woeful leadership and even his close ally, union baron Len McCluskey, stuck the boot in yesterday.An Opinium poll of , adults found  per cent said Mr Corbyn’s leadership was the reason they did not vote Labour.Sir Keir Starmer is now the favourite to take over as Labour boss - but Jess Phillips threw her hat in and Emily Thornberry gave a speech hinting shell go for it too. David Lammy also broke cover to suggest he will throw his hat into the ring to succeed Mr Corbyn.Monday - Mini re-shuffle to replace culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, and Welsh secretary, Alun CairnsTuesday - MPs are sworn in at the House of CommonsThursday - Boris Johnson will unveil the Queens Speech, outlining the new governments legislative programme for the coming yearFriday - Withdrawal bill brought back,the Speaker allows itJanuary  - MPs debate the withdrawal bill this weekJanuary  - Parliament needs to have passed the withdrawal bill by this date so that the agreement can be ratied by the European Parliament at its plenary session in StrasbourgJanuary , pm - Britain to leave the EUAs Labours civil war waged on, his former top aide Karie Murphy was accused of trying to throw him under the bus.The Mail on Sunday claimed the aide had formed a pact with Len McCluskey to highlight Corbyn as the reason for Labours defeat, rather than the partys policies.A source said: Karie is now dropping Jeremy like a stone.

David Lammy also broke cover to suggest he will throw his hat into the ring to succeed Mr Corbyn.Tottenham MP Lammy said: “Of course I’m thinking about it, because people like me that have been in the party for  years have now got to do a lot of heavy lting to get us into the right place.”Ruth Smeeth declared that she lost her because Labour is now the racist party and blamed Corbyn, adding they should have ditched him months ago.Her furious tirade came as she announced she had “definitely lost” her seat on a crushing general election night for Labour.Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent South constituency was one of Labour’s “Red Wall” seats that fell to the Conservatives to re-draw the political map of England.She blasted: “Jeremy Corbyn’s actions on antisemitism have made us the nasty party. We are the racist party.“He should have gone many many, many months ago. I am, well I was, the Parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement.We passed a motion of no confidence in him in April.There is absolutely no justication for why he is still there and his personal actions have delivered this result for my constituents and for swathes of the country overnight.Smeeth lost her seat to the Conservatives, the first time in history theyve held the Stoke-on-Trent seat.And Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, although retaining his seat, also last night brutalised Corbyn - amid claims the partys safest seat in Scotland was under threat.Murray - now Scotlands only Labour MP - said: Every door I knocked on, and my team and I spoke to , people, mentioned Corbyn.Not Brexit but Corbyn. I’ve been saying this for years.The outcome is that we’ve let the country down and we must change course and fast.Former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw jumped on the bandwagon of critics, saying he was relieved Mr Corbyn had lost. He branded him an “apologist” for the IRA and said he “had this worry that the country could be in really dangerous hands” had Labour won.Labour moderate Wes Streeting said Mr Corbyn and his hard-left pals — who include Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell — must take the blame for the defeat.He added: “They had the leader they wanted, the NEC they wanted, the manesto the wanted. The one thing they didn’t have was the support of the British people.”Corbyn is still in denial about the flaws in his leadership and policies leading to Labours crushing defeat.He said: “I think the issue that dominated this election, ultimately, was Brexit.“Our policies, I’ve named some, there are many others I could name, were actually, all of them, inidually, very popular.“There was no huge debate or disagreement in the party about any of the policies in our manesto. The issue was, ultimately, the Prime Minister said he’s going to get Brexit sorted.”Corbyn thanked his sons before thanking his we for all that she puts up with because of the way in which the media behaved towards me, towards her and indeed towards my party during this election campaign.But clinging on to his Islington seat, Corbyn said it had been a very disappointing night as support for his party crumbled in Labours former heartlands.The MP ran as an outside candidate for the party leadership in  and managed to outlast two Tory prime ministers.But finally conceding defeat as the red wall was left in tatters, he said he will call it a day on his time as leader - although he refused to immediately step down.He said: I will not lead the party in any future general election campaign.I will discuss with my party to ensure there is a process of reflection on this result and I will lead the party during that period to ensure the discussion takes place and we will move on into the future.Upon Corbyns loss, the Tories’ Michael Gove sent a moving message to Jewish Brits. He reassured them they would “never have to live in fear again” after Corbyn’s defeat.He denounced the Labour chief for embracing “anti-Jewish rhetoric” and “anti-Jewish terrorists”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was  re-visited, right down to a socialist icon like Dennis Skinner being ousted the same way Tony Benn was, and a thumping rejection of Labour giving Margaret Thatcher, like Boris Johnson, the chance to go after the enemy with a merciless vengeance. The Cabinet will now be dominated by hardline right-wingers like Priti Patel, Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, authors of a book called Britannia Unchained. It advocated Thatcherite free-marketeering taken to extremes, with everything up for sale and all workers’ rights turned to dust. This is what post-Brexit paradise will look like. As in  Labour has to take a hard look at itself and ask why many voters in their heartlands deserted them and how a man like Skinner, who held Bolsover for  years, can be so callously discarded by his own working-class people. But Johnson will inevitably let those people down. That’s what he specialises in. They will soon realise he won’t Get Brexit Done for their benefit and the only potential being unleashed will be for the rich to get even richer.

Pulling no punches, Mr Blunkett quoted Oliver Cromwell, telling the current Labour leader: In the name of God, go! Writing in The Daily Mail , he said: The clique running the Labour Party clearly regarded compromise as betrayal, because it dilutes their ideology.

People are being urged to look for brown, hard walnut-sized lumps, which look like pine cones, as they may in fact be a sac of - praying mantis eggs. The lumps are usually found on the end of branches and your toasty living room is the prime environment for the critters to hatch. Molly Kreuze, from Springfield, Virginia in the US, was stunned to find her Christmas tree had smuggled hundreds of bugs into her home. She found them crawling up her walls, ceilings and even in her bathroom and bedroom. “They’re fast. They jump,” she said. To catch the bugs, veterinarian Molly used a box and an envelope, as well as feeding them fruit flies before they were removed from her home. “In my Googling, I discovered that people really like praying mantises,” she said. “They are useful, they eat other bugs. People use them for organic gardening.” Praying mantises can grow to be up to  inches long, according to  National Geographic . And the insects, typically brown or green, are well-camouflaged on trees and other plants. Daniel Reed also previously issued the warning on social media about the bugs and his message has been doing the rounds once again this year.  More than , Facebook users have shared the post, with thousands more commenting on it. Daniel advised thatyou find the lump on your tree, to simply cut off the branch and put it outside in the garden. He wrote: If you happen to see a walnut sized shaped egg mass, on your Christmas tree, don’t fret, clip the branch and put it in your garden. These are - preying mantis eggs! We had two egg masses on our tree this year. Don’t bring them inside they will hatch and starve! One person commented: “Another reason I have a fake tree.” A second said: “If I start seeing things crawling across the floor I will be gone until after Christmas.”  A third wrote: “If only I knew this last year before they hatched and were all over my walls.” The warning only applies to real Christmas trees and finding clumps are rare, especially in the UK. However, a Norway Spruce, Scots Pine or Fraser Fir might have once been home to one of the bugs. Research has also revealed that legions of lice, mites, moths and spiders can be lurking in Christmas trees too. [Bugs] hibernate for the winter and usually empty their bodies of fluids, produce a chilled liquid and become completely inactive, said Bjarte Jordal, associate professor of the University Museum of Bergen told the  IB Times  .  Upon feeling the heat and being awakened by the light, they believe that springtime has arrived and spring back to le. If you pound the tree on a white cloth before you throw it out after Christmas, you will discover quite a number of small bugs. The study also found that most mites will remain on the trees and soon die owing to a lack of food available to them indoors. A number of people have been sharing their horror stories. One wrote on social media: “A couple years ago the egg case was really hidden because we check our trees well. “After it was in the house for several weeks they sprang or hatched and yes a couple hundred.” "},{"url":null,"title":"by time its taken you","story":"NewsopinionBy the time it’s taken you to have a sip of tea a child will have been mutilatedEvery  seconds, a little girl is taken away to undergo female genital ­mutilation - the #drawaline campaign aims to stop this happeningShareCommentsBySaira Khan:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsopinionA survivor of female genital mutilation \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Lisa Marsay is distraught at the thought of spending Christmas and the winter months in her bombsite home. And she has pleaded for Your Homes Newcastle to move the family somewhere safer. The -year-old told Chronicle Live: I have a -month-old son and I canapost put him on the floor in case he picks the fungus up and eats it. Lisa claims the problems started shortly after the family moved into the home in Westerhope, Newcastle, in August. Have you been affected by this story or have a similar issue to share  Email webnews@mirror  I noticed black patches around September and since then it has just got worse and worse, she claimed. They sent inspectors out and they confirmed damp. A plasterer came but he said aposIaposve only been given a couple of hours for this job, thereaposs no way I could do it - Iaposd need daysapos. The home is so bad that Lisa has resorted to using duct tape to hold down the wallpaper to stop son Hunter from touching the damp. She said: My son was two months premature and has problems with his chest anyway, but heaposs had issues since we moved in.  I had cancer a few years ago so my immune system is already poor to start with, but it is affecting us all. Even my own GP has told us we should get out as a matter of urgency and Iaposve been in tears trying to get this sorted out. She also claims carpets, which she spent £, on just a few months ago, are now ruined. Lisa believes the property needs a full refurbishment to make it safe to live in. And after months of struggling to resolve the situation, Lisa contacted her local councillor George Pattison for help.  The Labour councillor visited the property himself and said he was left horried. It is inhabitable - it is disgraceful, he added. He emailed senior figures at the charity, pleading for them to make the familyaposs plight a priority. According to the former Lord Mayor, Your Homes Newcastle acted quickly on his request. However, the familyaposs hope of moving were quickly dashed when the organisation instead deemed the problems could be fixed.  It is a complete bombsite and it would need a complete refurbishment, added the councillor. Your Homes Newcastle has since told  ChronicleLive  it will support Lisashe wants to look for another property. “We apologise to Ms Marsay for any distress caused and continue to work closely with her to recty the situation, said Ian Gallagher, assistant director of Operational Property Services.

At the age of , Chris had a stroke, and was later diagnosed with prostate cancer. In the following years, his successful property company folded and he was forced to sell all his worldly possessions. Chris, now , said: We had the big house, the car, everything, then the perfect storm blew and it all fell apart. I had a stroke, which really knocked me off my feet, found I had prostate cancer then people I had really trusted let me down financially.  Between  and ,  I saw everything evaporate before my eyes, cars, property, business and sadly people I had considered friends. Only one person stayed true, my partner. I sold everything I could to keep us going but it wasnapost enough. Friends offered to help to start with but, when you have nothing, no-one wants to know you anymore. Chris, who now lives in Stirchley and has asked for his partner and her child to remain anonymous, added: It was like a vacuum of nothingness. Iaposd grown up with prosperous parents and had always had money in my pocket. Now I was wondering what are we going to eat tonight  I had absolutely nothing when I walked out of my house. I couldnapost take my family photos, pictures of my mother were lost because thereaposs only so much you can take with you. All those memories were left behind. I was ready to sleep under a hedge. The family spent several months sleeping in their car in the freezing temperatures, desperately trying to find food and stay warm and clean. Chris said: We spent that Christmas in our car. Ordinary family celebrations are forgotten, it just becomes another day to try to find something to eat. I used to be a pilot with the air force so I know how to survive but for my partner and her daughter the hardships they suffered were horrendous. Keeping clean is such a problem when youaposre homeless. I have a masters degree but I couldnapost get a job in a warehouse because I looked so dirty. Eventually, Chris made the decision to relocate his family to the countryside, believing they would feel safer.  They went to Worcestershire, where they chanced upon a couple who helped them turn their lives around. Chris said: The city is a hostile place and, with a very young child, I wanted us to be safe. I thought it would be easier to survive in the countryside than the city so we drove as far as we could until our petrol ran out and that was Worcestershire. Then we met a farmer and his we who showed us such kindness. They offered us their garden shed to sleep in. It was spring  and was bitterly cold with snow on the ground. This gave us a fire to keep warm and we could walk to the farm workersapos shower block to have a wash and use the lavatory. It may not sound much, but it became a palace, it gave us a little bit of pride back and the confidence to move forward and rebuild our lives. I shall be eternally grateful to them because without that help I’m sure we would not be here today. To make money to buy food, Chris and his partner began selling logs. They were then put in touch with a team that helps to re-house the homeless by offering them subsidised rent and zero deposit.  The family still sells logs, and now rents a small house in Stirchley. Now, they want to pay forward the kindness that they were shown by helping other homeless people to get off the streets. They have set up a project called Just the Ticket - a discount voucher scheme that encourages people to hop locally and donate to the homeless at the same time. Chris said: Our idea is simple. We approach local independent businesses and ask them to generate an offer that will attract customers to their company – it may be a coffee shop that gives a cake for buying a latte, it may be a travel shop that offers  per cent off the cost of a holiday. He added: The shops pay for the vouchers to be printed and bundles of a dozen or so dferent vouchers are put inside a cover that explains the offers to the public. The books of vouchers are then sold for around £ each by homeless people who get to keep all they take. It’s a win – win.

Graham, , decks out the family home in thousands of multi-coloured bulbs in tribute to disabled Jessica, who died at just . He started putting the lights up for Jessica to cheer her up when she was a child – and the display got so big he eventually threw it open to the public. After Jessica lost the battle with her condition in , Graham carried on the tradition of putting the lights up and letting people come to see them infor donations. So far he has raised £, for the hospice which helped his sister throughout her le. Last year alone he raised £, from , visitors to his display, which includes the word “Jessica” spelled out in capital letters in front of the house. There are also light-up snowmen, penguins and reindeer, a tree, a grotto, a bridge and even a vintage ice cream van decked out in bulbs. This year alone, Graham had , visitors on the opening night at the family home, Carters Green Farm in Weston, Cheshire. And now he has so many bulbs that even he has lost count. He said: “It’s impossible to estimate how many lights we have. “The Christmas tree alone has  metres of string lights, there are rope lights, characters, a grotto and a sled.” Graham was a lad when he first started putting up festive lights for Jessica, who was severely epileptic and had seizures regularly. She also suffered from cutaneous syndrome, a condition which causes severe disability. The display started with a trip to BQ and got bigger and bigger until, six years ago, a neighbour suggested Graham open it to the public to raise money for charity. He chose The Donna Louise Hospice in Trentham, Staffs, where Jessica had respite care and support. Now the display has grown so huge it is sponsored by local businesses to help with the expense of running it. Graham, an NHS worker, starts putting the lights up in September and doesn’t get them all down until March because he only has time at weekends. He said: “I remember the first year we did it. Me and a friend sat waiting for visitors, popping out and speaking to them as they arrived. Each year it grew and now we have  volunteers helping out.  Jessica went into hospital in December , five days after her th birthday, and died on New Year’s Eve. Graham, who lives with dad David and mum Jane, said: That year was awful because we knew Jessica wasn’t going to come home.

Molly-Ann, three, had opened her presents – and a doll called Annabel was her favourite. Hours later, with her family by her bedside, she took her last breath. Nothing could make up for Ann’s loss, but she never forgot the support of kids’ cancer charity CLIC Sargent during her darkest hour. And little more than a year after Molly-Ann died, Ann realised that by helping the charity herself, she could pay tribute to her girl – and ease the never-ending pain. Ann became a volunteer and now,  years on, dedicates every Christmas to helping other children with cancer. Ann, , said: “Molly-Ann would be so proud to see me now, giving other families the love and support we had. “It’s a privilege and means I can celebrate Christmas again, something I never thought I’d ever be able to do.” Today, Ann is urging Sunday Mirror readers to dig deep to keep Christmas magical for families experiencing their own cancer journey. We launched our Home from Home Christmas appeal last month. Donations will go to help fund accommodation provided by CLIC Sargent near specialist cancer wards, so that families with sick children in hospital can be closer to them. Ann knows just how important these homes are – she manages two near her home in the Bristol area. She told us: “Even the smallest contribution makes such a massive dference. Without the support of the public I couldn’t have coped and I wouldn’t be here now, helping others. “These families need your help to have an amazing Christmas against all the odds.” You can stop cancer cancelling this Christmas for young patients and their families.

It was in  that little Molly-Ann, then two, started complaining of hip pain. Ann took her to the GP nine times, but was told it was probably growing pains. The tot was tall for her age and dad John was ft in. But after one terribly painful night Ann took Molly-Ann to AE and scans confirmed her worst fear. She said: “Our little girl had stage four neuroblastoma, a particularly aggressive form of the disease.” The primary tumour was attached to her pituitary gland, but the cancer had spread to her bones, explaining Molly-Ann’s pain. She was admitted to Bristol Children’s Hospital, starting a -month fight for survival. She had  days of chemotherapy, surgery, a stem cell transfusion and radiotherapy. By October  Ann and John got the news they prayed for – Molly-Ann was cancer-free.  But weeks after going home she had shoulder pain – and scans showed the cancer was back, but much worse. Ann, whose other children Anthony, , and Claire, , were then in their teens, said: “It was decided no more could be done for her. We could only keep her comfortable and minimise her pain before we said goodbye. Our hearts were ripped to pieces.” The family converted a dining room into a bedroom for Molly-Ann. They then met their “ angel” – a CLIC Sargent support nurse named Sally – for the first time. Ann said: “Molly-Ann needed lots of morphine and chemo and Sally guided us through every step. shoulder “Sally didn’t just care for Molly-Ann, she cared for all of us, talking to Anthony and Claire about what was happening in a way we simply couldn’t, being a shoulder for us to cry on when we needed it.” Brave Molly-Ann clung on until Christmas Day. Her eyes lit up when she opened her gts, including the doll. At just after pm, stroking her doll, she took her last breath with her family crowded around the bed. Ann was devastated. “I seriously never thought I could ever celebrate Christmas again,” she said.  “We decided to rename Christmas Day as Molly-Ann Day, and the following December we planted a tree in our garden with a star on top in honour of our beautul little girl. “Two nursery friends – Gemma and Alfie – came to put their decorations on the tree, which meant so much to us. Having grieved for over a year, on what would have been Molly-Ann’s fth birthday I blew out the candles on her cake, said a prayer and picked up the phone to Sally. I had to do this for Molly-Ann and also for me, to move on and find something positive.” Ann threw every ounce of energy and compassion into volunteering for CLIC Sargent. In  she was made local Homes from Home manager, caring for up to  families. Gemma and Alfie have visited Ann every Christmas, bringing tree decorations bearing Molly-Ann’s name or photo. The heartwarming routine – and Ann’s work with CLIC Sargent – lts her at the most dficult time of year.

Boyfriend Paul Barnes had warned her therapist of his plans to end their relationship on August  - a move which could have increased her risk of suicide. The mental health teams were aware Madi had taken an overdose following a previous break-up, the inquest heard. But aposno actionapos was taken after Mr Barnes contacted them and the system at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust is now under review. Madi, who worked at the University of Birmingham, was found dead shortly before pm on August  at her house. Area Coroner Emma Brown recorded a verdict of suicide and concluded there had been aposclear failingsapos at an inquest hearing on Monday .Mr Barnes, who was also Madiaposs carer, expressed concerns on August , ahead of her final psychotherapy session. She had been attending therapy for nine months with Laura Chaisty, a specialist psychotherapist and art psychotherapist for Birmingham and Solhull Mental Health Trust. As a result of Mr Barnes contact, Miss Chaisty penned a y email to the Community Mental Health Team as she was due to go away on annual leave for two weeks. I contacted the Community Mental Health Team to raise their awareness of Madi and to say that she may need extra support, she told the court. My sense was that Madi may make contact and that might raise further input from the Community Mental Health Team. I didnapost feel that the level of risk was dferent. I did know there was a circumstance change which is why I raised their awareness of her.  Sharon Whitehead, a registered mental health nurse, picked up the email from Miss Chaisty but no attempt was made to contact Madi. A risk assessment was not looked at nor updated. Mrs Whitehead told the inquest: It didnapost worry me at the time. When I read the email I thought it was for information only. But because she had her appointment [that day] I was confident that they would make that assessment and that judgement. During the last session Madi expressed suicidal thoughts with her therapist - but Miss Chaisty said this was apossadly normal for herapos. It was dficult for her to feel vulnerable and ask for help. It was really dficult for Madi to reach out, she explained. Miss Chaisty did not believe her risk of suicide was increased at that point and no further contact was made with Madi or the mental health team. It is with great regret that I did not feel there was an additional risk, she added, addressing Madiaposs family. There were other concerns that Madi should have had a care coordinator to manage the two services and act as a support line - especially while her psychotherapist was away on leave. This policy that every patient should have a coordinator is currently under review, the court was told. Madiaposs mum Clelia Boscolo questioned why she was never contacted over her daughteraposs welfare concerns - and instead was only called two days after her death when it was too late.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched. Dunfermline have started winning games and we’ve started losing them.“I met Stevie at a reserve game recently and we were talking about how quickly things can turn.“It shows you thatyou put a couple of results together you’re right back up there. They’re in the play-off places where we need to get back to.“It’s a big game on Saturday, we need to be really positive and take the game to them.”The Dens gaffer is wary of the threat posed by Dunfermline frontman Kevin Nisbet, who has scored  goals in his last seven matches for the Pars.But he says,his team can supply the Dundee strikers with the service Nisbet has enjoyed at East End Park then it’ll be the home attackers making the headlines.He said: “Nisbet is a player I like.“He was a threat in the first game of the season and we’ve obviously seen what he can do since then.“They get the ball into the box for him. The big thing is they’re creating the chances for him and he’s putting them away.“I believe we’ve got strikers who are every bit as good as anybody in the league – and they will score plenty of goals with the right service.Arbroath - Dundee: Dark Blues# winless run extends to four thanks to Bobby Linn#s curler\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arbroath---dundee-dark-blues-winless-run-extends-to-four-thanks-to-bobby-linns-curler embed # secrettQXpZpu\" data-secret\"tQXpZpu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“With the strikers we’ve got in our team, we have to play to their strengths. Kane Hemmings’ goal on Saturday is an example.“It was a great striker’s goal. He likes getting on the end of crosses.

When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that. I can only work as hard as possible and I’m sure it will come together again and I can get back to how I was playing last season and enjoying things again.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c9395086ee127.15107893-846x564.jpg ","title":"mcmullan returns for arbroath clash","story":"Dundee United are set to welcome Paul McMullan back to the fold for tomorrow’s trip to Arbroath.The winger sat out Tuesday night’s - win at Morton with a groin strain picked up in the previous match against Alloa.However, the -year-old is expected to be fit for the Gayfield clash as United aim to pick up their eighth win in a row and stretch their -point lead at the top of the Championship.Terrors boss Robbie Neilson said: “He’ll be fine, he did a bit of training yesterday and we’re hopeful he’ll do full training today.“He had a problem in the game against Alloa but managed to get through the match.“We hoped it would settle down because it’s something he had a month or two ago as well.“He’ll be ready for tomorrow.”Robbie also gave an update on Peter Pawlettand Cammy Smithwith the former set to miss out once again.He added: “Peter’s going to be another couple of weeks.

She spent most of her time alone in her bedroom.One day she randomly bought an embroidery kit online and became hooked on having a task and “creating something beautul”, improving her feeling of self-worth in the process.Inspired, she was suddenly eager to take part in crafting sessions to learn more but could only manage a few steps outside the door.Nicola said: “Everyone was out living their lives and to me an achievement would be only napping once a day, instead of three times.“When I first started going out again it was terrying. I felt so shaky and unsure of everything.“I’d been in the house so long that one of our downstairs neighbours who moved in four years earlier didn’t even know I lived there.“I knew from research it was important not to push myself into things too fast, so I stopped at the end of the path.“Turning around to go back inside was a huge relief and getting back into our flat was like being wrapped in a big safety blanket but I soon became aware of how confined I was inside.” vw, px\"  Nicola slowly began to attend crafting workshops with her parents also in attendance, the first of which was a puppet making class ran by How It Felt.The social enterprise uses puppet-making and drama sessions to encourage people to talk about mental health issues, which Nicola says played a huge part in her recovery journey.From there she got the confidence to join other crafting groups and started an online distance learning course with the Embroiderer’s Guild to ease back into studying.Nicola says she still often feels unwell but the intensity has reduced to such an extent that she hopes to one day study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"sweet-smell-success-stunning-star-sophia-loren","story":"ON A rainy day in Glasgow, Sophia Loren gazes wistfully across the city, as starry-eyed shoppers gathered below in the hope of catching a glimpse of their idol."},{"url":null,"title":"2020-edition-glasgow-times-past-calendar---need-know","story":"ITS the bestselling calendar that each year showcases some great images from our huge photo archive."},{"url":null,"title":"rich-man-poor-man-life-expectancy-gap","story":"Men in the poorest areas of Glasgow are expected to die  years earlier than in the most affluent areas of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"pre-payment-changes-scottish-gas-accounts","story":"Scottish Gas customers are being warned about changes to pre-payment accounts coming in the new year."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-st-mungo-miracles-know-history-books","story":"THE trouble with the Dark Ages is that they are very aptly named.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Last month rector William Crossan said staffing levels were being reviewed and two teaching posts could be lost at the school.On Monday Lieutenant Commander Mark Farley of the US Navy told the Kintyre Working Group that there was only a #remote possibility# that a pull-out would be cancelled. He added: #But you can be sure of our desire to stay.#An outstanding relationship has been built up with the local people, and it is a perfect location, with great training facilities.#It is understood that no alternative location for the unit has been identied yet.And RAF spokesman said there had been talks with the US military about the withdrawal.#The future of the base is under continuing review and the departure of the US Navy is not the only factor which has to be taken into account.#In June RAF Machrihanish was reduced to #care and maintenance# status.FIFTY YEARS AGOShellfish plant operationalCampbeltown at last has a stake in the new, growing shellfish processing industry.Two local men, Mr George McMillan and Mr Duncan L.

This output is expected to increase next week, when they will employ an additional three workers.At present  bags of the #queenie# scallops are being processed daily. By the beginning of December it is hoped that  bags will be handled.Mr George McMillan said that it is hoped eventually to employ from  to  people. He stressed that meantime Davaar Seafoods was occupying only part of the slaughterhouse building on a temporary basis. He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F.

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

I think the going rate was £ per day, quite a sum in , and I believe there was quite a queue, unfortunately I couldn#t sign up as I was working at Jaeger.It was quite an event and some friends who were taking part told me later about their experiences with fake blood and bandages etc and others getting kitted out with Russian army unorms and weapons. Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers. Great memories.I also remember the scrapped jet engines from the wrecked airliner lying in McFadyen#s yard in Glebe street for a long time.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of organisations involved in business transport in Haddington and confirmed invitees include Haddington Business Community Partnership, Haddington Community Development Trust, East Coast Buses, Prentice Coaches, Lothian Buses."},{"url":null,"title":"pair-travel-10k-wheelchairs-help-day-centre","story":"Megan Roland from Gford and Joanne Rye from Ormiston both completed the k journey from Ormiston to Tranent and back with help from their support workers.Through sponsorship they raised pound for Ormistonrsquos Primrose Day Centre.Megan, , and Joanne, , have support needs and have required the use of wheelchairs all their lives.They duo had assistance on the trek from their support workers Catherine Mitchell and Jackie Hoy.Joanne told the Courier: ldquoIt was exciting because Jackie, Megan and Cath did it with me and my niece and sister came along too.ldquoWe did it for Alzheimerrsquos as my mum has it and I wanted to do it for the Primrose Day Centre as she goes there.ldquoIt was a very successful and very fun sponsored walk.Megan and Joanne used to live together until Megan moved out to a house of her own.They have been on holidays together, including one memorable trip to Blackpool."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8712634.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!!

Like most of the country, the SNP did not believe Brexit would happen. It famously spent less money campaigning to stay in the EU than it did on a byelection in Glenrothes.However, as the main party of independence, it had to refer to a referendum somehow.So it arrived at a baroque, Brexit-related form of words that held out the possibility of independence, albeit in what it then considered highly improbable circumstances.The SNP then went backwards in . Although its constituency vote share rose .%, their regional share fell .%, and they fell from  MSPs to , losing their overall majority.A rum sort of basis for a mandate.Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens went off on their own tangent.Their  manesto had touted ldquoa multi-option referendum with choices including the status quo, a stronger Scottish Parliament with powers defined through a participative process, and full independence based on a written constitution.But by September , the Greens said the timing of Indyref, should no longer be the plaything of politicians.Instead it ldquoshould be determined by public appetitehellip For example, a call for a referendum signed by up to m people on the electoral register.Thus their  manesto said: ldquoIf a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage. In such a referendum the Scottish Greens will campaign for independence.But there was never a petition.All of which gives Boris Johnson enough room to contest the validity of Ms Sturgeonrsquos mandate, at least until the  election comes round.

The listening, however, was not to the British people but Conservative grassroots, who effectively reinforced the view that there was nothing wrong with the partyrsquos policies they were simply not sold hard enough to an uncomprehending public.If Labour does the same, then it, like the Tories in  will be out of power for at least a decade or more.Last night, a rumour was doing the rounds at Westminster Boris Johnson would on Saturday venture to northern England to make a speech, underpinning his commitment to his new blue-collar constituency in what were former Labour heartlands.As the Oppositionrsquos soul-searching began, so too did the process for the bruised Liberal Democrats, whose own poor performance was encapsulated by the loss of their leader Jo Swinson. For the second time in four years, the Scot became the victim of an SNP surge.In her farewell address, Ms Swinson said she had been \"devastated\" by the election results, in which her party took just  seats, down by one on the partys  showing at the polls.But she insisted she did not \"regret trying\" to be the \"unapologetic voice of Remain\" and \"giving people the chance to choose to stop Brexit\".And yet it may well be the Lib Dem leadershiprsquos decision to aclaim it could go from  seats to  seats in one giant leap to form a majority government and bscrap Brexit altogether without another referendum put many voters off.Ms Swinson and her advisers had been warned at the partyrsquos autumn party conference from grandees like Simon Hughes and Norman Lamb that backing a policy to revoke Article  was a bad move it would push the centrist Lib Dems to an extreme position a mirror image of Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party.Even at the launch of the partyrsquos manesto in Camden, the leader began to row back on the prospect of a Lib Dem Government, lowering her sights to simply stopping the Conservatives getting a majority.And she later had to admit as the polls for her party went south, that the idea of her entering No  was ldquovery unlikely. Hubris, as always, was followed by nemesis.And so, like Labour, it looks like it will take many years for the Lib Dems to claw their way back to anything like the number of MPs they had under Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy or Nick Clegg.All the zealous converts, Chuka Ummuna, Sam Gyimah and Luciana Berger failed to secure seats under the orange banner.With Ms Swinsonrsquos departure, Ed Davey, the deputy leader, and party President, Baroness Brinton, were quickly installed as their partyrsquos joint acting leaders.Interestingly, in her valedictory speech Ms Swinson name-checked all the partyrsquos experienced female MPs as possible successors: Sarah Olney Wera Hobhouse Christine Jardine and Layla Moran.ldquoWe will reflect, regroup and refresh,\" declared the former party leader.Having seen a Brexit-backing Conservative Party and the Scottish Nationalists make gains at the election, she warned of a \"resurgent Nationalism\" in the country and urged the party to \"foster hope\".She added: \"All of us who share an alternative vision for society have a responsibility to learn from these results and find new answers.

in a declaration thatrsquos enough to make you want to pour a very stf drink ndash a dram, preferably ndash our national drink has been declared as anything but.According to the makers of a new film that explores the cultural impact of whisky from its origins to modern times, whiskyrsquos Scottish roots would appear to be ever so slightly Irish.Asthat wasnrsquot enough to make whisky drinkers choke on their finest malt, therersquos even a very strong hint that our best-loved export might just have a slice of English DNA too.According to Glasgow-based whisky expert Dave Broom, who explores whiskyrsquos heritage in the film The Amber Light, and its producer Adam Park, there is ldquostrong evidence to suggest whisky may have been first developed in Ireland and brought to Islay, to be drunk at the seat of the High Kings.There, under the distilling expertise of one particular Irish family, the spirit is thought to have evolved into a tipple bearing at least a passing similarity to todayrsquos whisky.According to Mr Park, research carried out for the film suggests the Beaton family ndash Irish physicians who developed a vast international knowledge of botanical remedies ndash probably hold the key to the earliest forms of what would become the first Scotch whisky.ldquoThe Beatons were pretty amazing people, they travelled the world translating medical scripts and building their knowledge, he said.ldquoThey came to service of the High Kings and became experts in distilling spirit and added to it the plants and flowers that grew around them.The Beatons, whose family name appears as MacMeic-bethad and MacBeth, are thought to have arrived on Islay in the th century at the time of the marriage between Aine OrsquoCathain and Angus Og MacDonald, Lord Of The Isles.While there is no clear documentation to conclusively link the family to the origins of whisky, there are said to be clear signs their skills were almost certainly involved.Mr Park added: ldquoIt gets murky and therersquos not an accepted history of how whisky came about, but the best guess is the Beatons came to Islay when it was the seat of the High Kings who ruled huge parts of Scotland and Ireland.However, research for the film led to another twist: the English were probably already creating their own form of a dram at about the same time.Speaking to the , Mr Broom said: ldquoIf you look at the north of Ireland and across to Islay, thatrsquos the cradle of distillationhellip but the first record I found is in Chaucerrsquos Canterbury Tales.The Beaton family became hereditary physicians to the Scottish crown, serving Robert The Bruce and every subsequent Scottish king, while also providing medical knowledge to clan chiefs from the Western Isles to the Lowlands.They were known to make use of medicinal plants and traditional therapies at a time when others relied on superstition and myths as often ill-fated cures for illnesses and injuries.As word spread of their comforting drink, whisky stills spread across Scotland.Scotch whisky was first recorded on the Exchequer Rolls in  when a friar called John Cor, distiller at Lindores Abbey in Newburgh, Fe, and servant to the court of James IV, was noted to have made ldquoaqua vitae, VIII bolls of malt.While the Beatonrsquos fellow countrymen pursued distilling their own Irish whiskey, Mr Park says Scotsrsquo ingenious methods of circumventing taxes and American prohibition laws ndash when Scotch was allowed as a ldquomedicinal product ndash helped embed whisky as the premium spirit.Later, shrewd marketing practices with their focus on Highland history and heritage, saw whisky overwhelm its Irish and American cousins and lay foundations for todayrsquos pound. billion export market.The film, which is currently touring cinemas across the country, also explores how whisky has become embedded in Scottish culture yet is constantly evolving to attract new generations of drinkers.That, he adds, includes cocktails and mixers that shatter whiskyrsquos traditional ldquogentleman in tweeds image ndash such as Lagavulin mixed with Coke, dubbed a Smokey Cokey.ldquoLike any commercial enterprise, whisky needs to attract new customers, says Mr Park. ldquoThe image of the stuffy old man in a leather armchair in the library having an undiluted single malt is still there, but itrsquos also not there.A spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association said: ldquoThe earliest known record of Scotch Whisky production dates from the Exchequer Rolls of , but it is likely the lsquoAqua Vitaersquo was being produced long before this date.ldquoIt is likely early development of distillation in Scotland and Ireland took place in parallel, ultimately leading to two distinct global

Yet, on the eve of polling, the party had been confidently talking up gains to the media.At a joint event with her successor Jackson Carlaw, former leader Ruth Davidson had said she wanted to see her party take seats off the SNP.ldquoIrsquove not just been spending time in the seats that we hold trying to defend them, Irsquove been spending time in seats that wersquore trying to take, she said.In the end, the party went backwards in  of its  seats.The Tories did better on the offensive, increasing their vote in Lanark  Hamilton East, Ayrshire Central and Argyll  Bute, but by small or pitul amounts.They slumped in the ultra-marginal target of Perth  North Perthshire, where the SNPrsquos Pete Wishart had a majority of . He was ed with a majority of ,.The SNP increased their vote across the board.It was a stark contrast to , when Scotland had been the one bright spot for the Tories.Then, Scotland had been the only source of Tory gains, as the party under Ms Davidson picked up  seats and gaveTheresa May the numbers she needed to stay in power. The partyrsquos vote share increased by .%, double the rise across the UK.But at this election, Scotland provided the worst Tory result. The only nation in which the party lost MPs or vote share was Scotland.The Scottish campaign was based on making Ms Sturgeon and the SNP synonymous with Indyref in the belief Labour voters would vote tactically to protect the Union.But it turned out Labour voters preferred voting tactically to help the SNP get rid of Tories.The party knew Boris Johnson and Brexit werenrsquot going down well ndash they latterly airbrushed the PM out of their campaign ndash but thought Ms Sturgeon was even less popular.Their own animosity to ldquothat effing woman proved a blindspot. A big headache for the Scottish Tories is that this election was supposed to be the prelude to their Holyrood campaign of .The party was hoping to build up support and convert it into gains on the regional lists. Butit starts losing constituencies, those MSPs will wash up on the list as consolation wins under the proportional voting system and make net gains will be harder.One bleak omen for Mr Carlaw is that the Tory share of the vote fell almost  points in avowedly Remain East Renfrewshire, while the SNPrsquos rose . points. Now a born-again Leaver, Mr Carlaw represents the equivalent seat at Holyrood.A similar swing to the SNP in  would overturn his ,-vote majority, sending him back to the West of Scotland list. The one possible upside for the Scottish Tories is the election may lead to an injection of new blood at Holyrood, as defeated MPs look to Edinburgh for a new berth, clearing out some of the dead timber.Butthe results were bad for the Tories and their campaign against Indyref, they were truly atrocious for Scottish Labour. Despite its precarious hold on the electoral map ndash four of the seven seats it was defending had majorities below , ndash the party was predicting it wouldnine MPs just hours before the polls closed.It was over-confidence based on positive canvas s. In Glasgow North East, Paul Sweeney publicly predicted he would increase his -vote majority on the back of glowing canvas data.After the massive YouGov poll on Tuesday predicting a Tory landslide, the partyrsquos digital chief Aidan Kerr tweeted: ldquoGlasgow North East is not going to the SNP. Andthe pollsters think this, then God knows what  they have got wrong.Mr Sweeney lost to the SNPrsquos Anne McLaughlin by , votes. It was a profound failure of the party machine that points to deep, systemic problems. The party reckoned it was making a comeback in its old heartlands of Glasgow and North Lanarkshire.But when the results came in, Labour lost vote share in every Glasgow seat and in all its North Lanarkshire targets as well. In fact, Labour lost a bigger slice of its vote share in Scotland than anywhere  in the UK, down . points to a wretched .%, thanks to the loss of , votes.Its sole MP north of the Border is Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, who did not hesitate to blame Mr Corbyn for the partyrsquos desperate decline. Mr Leonard has now lost two elections in a year.Last night he vowed to lead his party into the  election as well. His opponents will be chuffed.The LibDems, despite losing Ms Swinson, were the steadiest party of the night. It gained North East Fe to stay on four MPs, increasing its share of the vote by . points.The upshot of it all is Ms Sturgeon will ramp up demands for Indyref. Mr Johnson called her last night to get his refusal in early. Because whatrsquos in it for him  If he granted a Section  order, despite his ldquoguarantee not do so, it would cause turmoil in his party.He also knows referendums bring down leaders. Ask David Cameron, Theresa May and Alex Salmond. Mr Johnson has no appetite to bring his premiership to an early end by granting and then losing Indyref.Perhaps most compelling for a politician who seems to care for little but himself, defeat would mean going down in the history books as the last Prime Minister of the UK, the man who made himself Minister for the Union then oversaw its break-up. It is not a legacy he would savour."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire council ensures a clear route for voters","story":"Final preparations are being made by Aberdeenshire Council to ensure voters have a clear route as they head for the polls later this week.With the General Election taking place on Thursdaythe Roads, Landscape and Waste Service has been reviewing its winter service arrangements and preparing a contingency plan which can be implemented in the event of severe weather occurring in the days before or during polling day.The service has been working closely with the council’s election team in the preparation of the plan which includes scenario planning for dferent levels of severe weather events, how that might impact on access to polling stations and what resources would be required in order to respond to severe weather.At this time, no specic information has been issued by the Met Office suggesting particularly severe weather, with Wednesday forecast to be largely dry with some light snow on very high ground from noon on Thursday through to midnight.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

That is where the terms of the trade deal between the UK and the EU will be agreed.“For NFUS, ensuring as free and as frictionless trade in agri-food goods with the EU, which remains our principal market outside of the UK, has been our priority from the start of this process.“Whether negotiating with the EU, or establishing new trade deals with other countries worldwide, a red line for us is that Scotland’s high standards must be recognised and protected.“Our members can be reassured that their union has begun engagement with this new parliament today and we will make tracks to Westminster at the earliest opportunity as we enter a new era for Scottish farming and crofting.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Molly Biwer, senior vice president for public affairs and communications at Hallmark, said: ldquoThe debate surrounding these commercials on all sides was distracting from the purpose of our network, which is to provide entertainment value.ldquoThe Hallmark brand is never going to be isive.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense.

It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited.

However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/001WH2911NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 29th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy.

While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"voters go to polls for westminster election","story":"POLLING stations have opened across the North in the General Election. candidates are competing for  Westminster seats.Polling stations opened at am and will close at pm with results expected to be finalised early on Friday morning.A total of ,, people are eligible to vote across the north.North Belfast is expected to witness one of the tightest contests, between DUP’s Nigel Dodds and Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, with Nuala McAllister of Alliance the other candidate on the ballot paper.In South Belfast, SDLP’s Claire Hanna is the bookies favourite to oust outgoing DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly.

Back in  he represented the area as mayor, later becoming its MLA.Twelve years later he is now the constituencys MP - a triumph for Alliance which few political pundits would have been comfortable betting their money on until yesterday, with most predicting the seat was there for the DUPs taking.Dr Farrys Westminster win is no mean feat - voters held his successor, the independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon, in huge affection. Like Lady Hermon, he is a firm Remainer, and during his campaign he was keen to stress their shared Brexit position.A Queens University graduate in Politics with a PhD in International Relations, Dr Farry is only the second Alliance politician to be elected to Westminster in its history.A fitting development, perhaps, given the Newtownards man is arguably Alliances second most high-profile name, behind leader Naomi Long.During his tenure in the Executive, he served as minister for employment and learning, and gained widespread praise for capping tuition fees in September . Following the  Assembly elections, he took up positions on the Stormont Committee for the Economy and Business Committee, positions he held until the collapse of power-sharing in .His political work has also garnered global attention: in  he was appointed an International Peace Scholar by the US Institute of Peace. The -year-old has always been a passionate advocate of Alliances cross-community ethos, but he himself has been caught in the crossfire of Northern Irelands green and orange politics.In , after fellow party members on Belfast City Council voted in favour of restricting the flying of the Union flag at City Hall to specic days throughout the year, his own constituency office in Bangor was the target of an attempted arson attack. But with Alliances gains in this latest election, Dr Farry will be hoping it indicates potential for growing the middle ground in local politics. *Stephen Farry was not available for an interview yesterday.Stephen FarryAllianceNorth DownWon by: , votesBrexit: Remain"},{"url":null,"title":"how the political pacts played out","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Green Party also pulled out to maximise the anti-Brexit vote in the constituency.The arrangements sparked controversy. IRA abuse victim Mairia Cahill resigned from the SDLP, calling it a ‘grubby sectarian pact’.

It said DUP , Sinn Fein , Alliance , SDLP  and UUP .Close, but not quite the cigar and while I did not do a GB forecast, the scale of the Corbyn catastrophe far exceeded that expected even by those of us long cynical concerning his capabilities.Understandably, the widely trumpeted headline is that unionist MPs will provide only a minority of Northern Irelands Westminster representatives, for the first time ever.The DUP came perilously close to being wiped out in Belfast amid a three-pronged attack from Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetBut as late as Thursday morning, the DUP was still very hopeful of holding North Belfast. I saw some of the bets that had been struck.Arlene Foster was neither wrong nor sectarian in blaming the grievous blow of losing Nigel Dodds on changing demographics.Lamenting a pan-nationalist pact will not wash, though, given the pressure placed upon Steve Aikens UUP to step aside in North Belfast.Even without a pact, Claire Hanna would almost certainly have won South Belfast for the SDLP.The  high water mark was always going to be dficult to defend. It is also worth remembering that DUP vote shares have risen more often in elections under Fosters stewardship than they have fallen.The DUP remains Northern Irelands largest party. data-dfpadtargetingThe DUPs Alex Easton is consoled by his we DeniseThat said, previous successes owed something to UUP weakness and Thursdays Belfast and North Down failures, along with several reduced majorities where, increase the pressure upon her leadership.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who saw his own constituency turn into a semi-marginal, is the obvious Westminster replacement leader for Dodds. His remit might ultimately be extended.Meanwhile, Alliances time has come.The partys voted soared by nearly %, to add to the % European election increase and % in the council contests.It is Alliances best year. This surge is causing problems for the UUP, searching for niche pro-Union distinctiveness, but Alliances extra vote is also coming from those who do not identy as unionist or nationalist. And that is a big and expanding reservoir in which Alliance can fish. What of Sinn Fein  It got the scalp it wanted with the Dodds decapitation and ended the election with the same number of MPs as it started.Yet overall performance was mediocre at best and occasionally poor.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood handed out a thrashing in Foyle probably beyond his own expectations, let alone anyone s. This in a city where Sinn Fein had staged its ard fheis, launched its manesto and brought in hundreds of volunteers in the last month. Sinn Feins % fall in vote share - even allowing for its non-participation in some constituencies - is part of a broader pattern of generally indferent recent election performances.While a Boris Brexit will now assist the party in establishing economic structures of unication and in effect special status for The North, it seems inconceivable that the Conservative Government will permit a border poll. There is no obvious short-or medium-term route to constitutional unity. The Prime Ministers immediate preoccupation will be somehow attempting to quell the burning independence fires in Scotland.While the success of the SDLP in Foyle will reawaken criticisms of Sinn Feins abstention from Westminster, it is unclear why.The grim truth for even the participatory victorious local MPs is that they will carry precious little clout at Westminster.They might enjoy the sights but not the politics.If the PM could discard the DUP so brutally when it held the balance of power, why would he listen to the pleas of  MPs who offer zero threat to his -seat majority So abstention may remain a non-issue within Sinn Fein. Evenit could be proved beyond doubt that abstention was harming Sinn Feins electoral fortunes, the party leadership would be wary of touching the issue.A two-thirds majority of members would be needed for change and risks a split. And anyone who thinks a split in the republican movement does not have its problems has slept through the last century.If locally elected politicians want power, they will need to restore Stormont.That is a possible outcome of Thursdays results.Sinn Fein would have a power base. The DUP might take the view that an Irish Language Act, in broader form, is the bitter pill that needs swallowing to avoid the grim vista of power being confined to local councils for at least half a generation.But such DUP willingness would be conditional upon them being still the largest party and providing the first minister after the next set of elections to the phantom Assembly, presumably in spring.Ready for yet more hot contests then Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and Principal Investigator of the ESRC  Northern Ireland election study"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38780628.ece/ac386/BINARY/POLITIC%201843.jpg","title":"south belfast proved to be a hard seat for dup to hold","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That would mean both big party leaders appear agreed on a vote being called in May .\"Easter to me is the natural cut-off point for this Dail,\" the Fianna Fail leader told RTEs News at One."},{"url":null,"title":"time as mp for mccallion not without controversy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With strong community activism roots, she had been a city councillor for  years and became the first mayor of the newly created Derry City and Strabane District Council.Mrs McCallion was one of seven Sinn Fein MPs who were elected to Westminster as abstentionist politicians, therefore she never took her seat on the green benches and didnt vote on the crucial Brexit votes that passed through parliament since her election to the post.Her time as MP was not without its controversy. In the days following her shock victory, reports surfaced of alleged voting fraud which was investigated, but no prosecutions came from the claims.In her first weeks in the job, she commented that her hotel room in London was \"smaller than her bathroom at home\", causing a wave of criticism. Just last month she was called on to apologise after claims she insulted residents in deprived areas of the constituency, by allegedly telling them via a live video while canvassing that they could open their doors as she \"was not a debt collector\".Yesterday she congratulated Derrys new MP, Colum Eastwood, and vowed to continue working for her city.\"Congratulations Colum on your impressive victory,\" she wrote on her Facebook page. \"I look forward to working with you in the future.

The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl.

We don’t want to generate controversy, we’ve tried very hard to stay out of it… we just felt it was in the best interest of the brand to pull them and not continue to generate controversy.”There was immediate backlash against the decision on Twitter.Isn’t it almost   @hallmarkchannel, @billabbottHC... what are you thinking  Please explain.

In the first instance, we urge all players to read in detail the full report from the GAA’s Fixtures Review Taskforce. Key principles agreed by the GPA and CPA are based upon the fundamental understanding that inter-county players are also club players and that this connection is the basis of the GAA. These are:  The club is the primary basic unit of the GAA from which everything springs. Therefore, this must be recognised in the status which club games are given. googletag.cmd.push  The inter-county game is the GAA’s biggest promotional and developmental tool. It is also the GAA’s primary revenue generator. This must be fully recognised in restructuring our national games calendar. Furthermore, both organisations are in agreement that, following the recent publication of the Fixtures Calendar Review Taskforce report, and prior to the next phase in that process which includes a series of regional seminars in which all key stakeholders will be provided with the opportunity to provide further views and feedback, there are a number of key points centred around time and governance that we mutually support and wish to highlight. googletag.cmd.push These are:  The Club Window in April May should be ened to a -week period to allow the fairest opportunity for the window to be successfully utilised.  The demands placed upon inter-county players in both club and inter-county windows will need to be governed to ensure the games training load is not detrimental to the players’ welfare.  The Club Window post the All-Ireland football final needs to be a minimum of  weeks before provincial club championships begin.  Club Windows will only work fairly for all,inter county competitions start their championships on the same dates.  There needs to be stronger adherence to provisions regarding the availability of inter-county players to clubs as referenced within GPA Squad Charters.  Bar club teams involved in provincial championships November should be used exclusively as an off season for inter-county players.  There needs to be strong governance and guidelines introduced to ensure club fixtures schedules are appropriately set out and adhered to throughout the year. “One of our core pillars is to protect the welfare of our members, statedPaul Flynn, GPA CEO. It is therefore vital that fixtures are properly governed to ensure the fundamental link between club and inter-county players is fully recognised and strengthened within the fixtures calendar. “This year we put a motion before GAA Congress to provide for a GPA representative to sit on the Central Competitions Control Committee to input on fixtures involving inter-county hurling and football competitions only, in a bid to improve the situation for our members.” “We will work towards this with the CPA, while prioritising the welfare of our members, keeping in focus the amount of games they are expected to play and amount of training they are expected to undertake.” Micheacuteal Briody, Chairman of the CPA, admitted that both the GPA and CPA have agreed the the current fixtures calendar isnt the best fit for both sets of players. “The CPA have advocated for a radical structural change to the fixtures calendar since our formation in , Briody commented. It is important now that the options for change put forward from the Task Force are disseminated to clubs immediately so that the debate can begin nationwide on what level of change is acceptable.” “We will work to ensurethis communication does happen effectively and it is criticalthat all clubs become aware of the options that are being presented and then vote for change that will alleviate the current unsatisfactory schedule.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are also a lot of people who have moved to universal credit and are still waiting for money and low-income families.“They have that choice of between having food or toys for their kids and nobody wants to see their kids go without.”There is a misconception that it is only the unemployed who visit food banks but Mr McMenamin said that zero hour contracts, minimum wage jobs and even a sudden change in circumstances means that nobody is insusceptible.“If you look at a family who are working, paying full rent or mortgage, plus childcare and they have an unexpected bill such as the car breaking down, that can take away any surplus money they may have had because they need that car for work.“Therefore, they’re left with a very dficult choice.”Vouchers are handed out on a daily basis by referral agencies across the town, such as Dove House, Hillcrest Hub, Caw and Nelson Drive and others throughout the city.Food Bank workers will sit down with people to find outthere are any underlying issues for which they need support.“It’s no good us just handing out food,” he explained. “We need to find out what the issue is so we can refer them on to a debt adviser, a benefit adviser, or it could be counselling or a GP they need an appointment with.”Mr McMenamin started out with Foyle Foodbank as a delivery driver and there are thirty volunteers based at its Apex owned premises in Springtown Industrial Estate. “We rely on them, we couldn’t operate without our volunteers.”“We’d be lost without the support of the public, our all stock comes from the public and local businesses, the food bank gets no funding whatsoever.“Christmas is an amazing time for us, we get so many donations which help to set us up for the rest of the year. The people in this town are just amazing.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Protect people’  Collection points are at Tescos and Sainsburys on the Strand Road, businesses also collect, there are appeals on Facebook and food can also be donated directly to the Food Bank. The links between welfare changes, food bank use and destitution are contested by dferent political parties. Trussell Trust. which runs two-thirds of the UK’s food banks include Foyle Foodbank, said it distributed a record number of food parcels between April and September this year, including , that went to children. It was a % increase on the same period last year, representing the steepest rise the charity has witnessed since its network of food banks was fully established.The Trust has called on politicians of all parties to pledge to protect people from hunger. It is demanding an end to the five-week wait for universal credit payments, a commitment to ensure benefit payments cover the basic costs of living, and investment in emergency support for people in crisis.Reflecting that view, Foyle Foodbank believes that local politicians need toto Stormont so that local issues can be addressed. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are also a lot of people who have moved to universal credit and are still waiting for money and low-income families.“They have that choice of between having food or toys for their kids and nobody wants to see their kids go without.”There is a misconception that it is only the unemployed who visit food banks but Mr McMenamin said that zero hour contracts, minimum wage jobs and even a sudden change in circumstances means that nobody is insusceptible.“If you look at a family who are working, paying full rent or mortgage, plus childcare and they have an unexpected bill such as the car breaking down, that can take away any surplus money they may have had because they need that car for work.“Therefore, they’re left with a very dficult choice.”Vouchers are handed out on a daily basis by referral agencies across the town, such as Dove House, Hillcrest Hub, Caw and Nelson Drive and others throughout the city.Food Bank workers will sit down with people to find outthere are any underlying issues for which they need support.“It’s no good us just handing out food,” he explained. “We need to find out what the issue is so we can refer them on to a debt adviser, a benefit adviser, or it could be counselling or a GP they need an appointment with.”Mr McMenamin started out with Foyle Foodbank as a delivery driver and there are thirty volunteers based at its Apex owned premises in Springtown Industrial Estate. “We rely on them, we couldn’t operate without our volunteers.”“We’d be lost without the support of the public, our all stock comes from the public and local businesses, the food bank gets no funding whatsoever.“Christmas is an amazing time for us, we get so many donations which help to set us up for the rest of the year. The people in this town are just amazing.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Protect people’  Collection points are at Tescos and Sainsburys on the Strand Road, businesses also collect, there are appeals on Facebook and food can also be donated directly to the Food Bank. The links between welfare changes, food bank use and destitution are contested by dferent political parties. Trussell Trust. which runs two-thirds of the UK’s food banks include Foyle Foodbank, said it distributed a record number of food parcels between April and September this year, including , that went to children. It was a % increase on the same period last year, representing the steepest rise the charity has witnessed since its network of food banks was fully established.The Trust has called on politicians of all parties to pledge to protect people from hunger. It is demanding an end to the five-week wait for universal credit payments, a commitment to ensure benefit payments cover the basic costs of living, and investment in emergency support for people in crisis.Reflecting that view, Foyle Foodbank believes that local politicians need toto Stormont so that local issues can be addressed. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It tells of a young girl who is transformed into a mermaid when a magical curse floods their ringfort, creating Lough Neagh Six Irish-medium primary schools in the Mid-Ulster area have been working on the story with Maacuteire Zepf over the past months, writing their own creative responses and drawing original illustrations for the story.The young writers and illustrators from Dungannon, Coalisland, Magherafelt, Ballinascreen, Cookstown and Tirkane then came together at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy on th December for a collaborative showcase performance of their work, to celebrate the project and to hear the story told in its entirety.The story of Liacute Ban is deeply rooted in the locality of the area, mentioning local places by name. References to the legend can also be spotted in many local place names.The project has been funded by a partnership between the Irish Writers’ Centre in Dublin and Mid-Ulster District Council.Martin Kearney, Chair of Mid-Ulster District Council attended the event. He said: “The story of Eochaidh and Liacute Ban shows just how rich and deep our local culture really is. Watching the children take it to their hearts today has been a lovely experience”Commenting on the project, Maacuteire Zepf said: “It was such a joy to unearth this gem of a local story with the children and to see their intense excitement about such an ancient tale. Hopefully, we can be assured now that Liacute Ban will live on now for the next generation.”Hilary Copeland, Acting Director of the Irish Writers’ Centre added:The Irish Writers Centre is delighted to support the Liacute Ban project. Our ‘writer-led’ programme offers writers the opportunity to develop their own creative projects, making use of their skills and experience with language and storytelling. We are grateful to Foras na Gaeilge for their continued support of Irish literature projects as Gaeilge.’ googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Council have supported calls to amend the Common Travel Agreementbetween Ireland and Britain.Lilian SeenoI-Barr said the passing of motions at both council meetings last week was most welcome and much appreciated by many migrants here as the Agreement as it currently operated discriminated, she claimed, against non-European people living on the island of Ireland. Speaking yesterday Mrs Seenoi Barr explained why the amendment was necessary: As someone who came from a non-EU country I experienced many of the restrictions the CTA imposed on me. For example, despite the fact I lived in Culmore I could not, quite literally, go half a mile down the road to Muff to buy a pint of milk. If I crossed the Border I was committing a crime. And this was despite the fact I was living in the North legally.She went on: The Common Travel Agreement was first agreed about a  years ago, in very dferent circumstances. I dont think it was envisaged back then that people from Africa or wherever would be living here. But thats how it is now. EU citizens can move freely between the North and the South, butyou are not an EU citizen you cant.I know of a nurse from South African living in Letterkenny who was detained for three days because she went to visit relatives in Scotland using Belfast airport. A Syrian boy in Belfast with a le-threatening heart condition needed emergency treatment that was only available in Dublin. Civil servants literally worked around the clock to sort out the red tape to ensure he could get that treatment. A young student in Derry couldnt go on a school trip to Dublin because she needed a visa. Every day we hear more and more about the impact of these kind of petty restrictions.Thanking everyone involved she said she wanted to acknowledge the support of all councillors from the ious parties who supported the motions calling for amendment to the CTA submitted by Councillor Martin Reilly in Derry and in Donegal by the chairman of Donegal Co. Council, Councillor Nicholas Crossan, who has also confirmed that Donegal Council has send a letter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the issue.The North West Migrants Forum has been to the forefront in leading the campaign for the amendment and Director Seenoi Barr said she had had a number of meetings with councillors and other interested parties in recent weeks seeking their support to ensure that this was seen as a cross Border campaign. She has also been in constant touch with the British Council to get their backing.Mrs Seenoi Barr concluded: The CTA needs to be amended because it is no longer fit for purpose. Times have changed. If we are serious about inclusion and belonging then we must stand up for people across all sections of the community who are being discriminated against or being treated unfairly. Our objective is to ensure that all who live legally on the island of Ireland have the same rights as privileges as each other. I have spoken to many elected representatives, on both sides of the Border and in Britain, and as we have clearly seen in recent days there is real support for getting it changed. And we here at the North West Migrants Forum will be leading from the front in the campaign to ensure that it is. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Council have supported calls to amend the Common Travel Agreementbetween Ireland and Britain.Lilian SeenoI-Barr said the passing of motions at both council meetings last week was most welcome and much appreciated by many migrants here as the Agreement as it currently operated discriminated, she claimed, against non-European people living on the island of Ireland. Speaking yesterday Mrs Seenoi Barr explained why the amendment was necessary: As someone who came from a non-EU country I experienced many of the restrictions the CTA imposed on me. For example, despite the fact I lived in Culmore I could not, quite literally, go half a mile down the road to Muff to buy a pint of milk. If I crossed the Border I was committing a crime. And this was despite the fact I was living in the North legally.She went on: The Common Travel Agreement was first agreed about a  years ago, in very dferent circumstances. I dont think it was envisaged back then that people from Africa or wherever would be living here. But thats how it is now. EU citizens can move freely between the North and the South, butyou are not an EU citizen you cant.I know of a nurse from South African living in Letterkenny who was detained for three days because she went to visit relatives in Scotland using Belfast airport. A Syrian boy in Belfast with a le-threatening heart condition needed emergency treatment that was only available in Dublin. Civil servants literally worked around the clock to sort out the red tape to ensure he could get that treatment. A young student in Derry couldnt go on a school trip to Dublin because she needed a visa. Every day we hear more and more about the impact of these kind of petty restrictions.Thanking everyone involved she said she wanted to acknowledge the support of all councillors from the ious parties who supported the motions calling for amendment to the CTA submitted by Councillor Martin Reilly in Derry and in Donegal by the chairman of Donegal Co. Council, Councillor Nicholas Crossan, who has also confirmed that Donegal Council has send a letter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the issue.The North West Migrants Forum has been to the forefront in leading the campaign for the amendment and Director Seenoi Barr said she had had a number of meetings with councillors and other interested parties in recent weeks seeking their support to ensure that this was seen as a cross Border campaign. She has also been in constant touch with the British Council to get their backing.Mrs Seenoi Barr concluded: The CTA needs to be amended because it is no longer fit for purpose. Times have changed. If we are serious about inclusion and belonging then we must stand up for people across all sections of the community who are being discriminated against or being treated unfairly. Our objective is to ensure that all who live legally on the island of Ireland have the same rights as privileges as each other. I have spoken to many elected representatives, on both sides of the Border and in Britain, and as we have clearly seen in recent days there is real support for getting it changed. And we here at the North West Migrants Forum will be leading from the front in the campaign to ensure that it is. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They were nursed back to health at Atnagelvin Hospitals Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where they spent the first few weeks of their lives.The girls are now aged four and are happy and healthy, but their mum and dad Bob and Michelle McLaughlin have never forgotten the nurses who cared for them when they were so vulnerable.The couple have since raised thousands of pounds for the NICU for supplies and equipment to help other babies who are born sick or too soon by holding an annual sponsored walk.But this year they wanted to give a special thank you to the NICU earth angel nurses and arranged a huge raffle and quiz night which raised pound, for the staff.The money was spent on  Foyleside vouchers and a pound MS voucher which were hand delivered by Saorlaith and Saoirse earlier this week.These nurses fought our battles in the NICU when we had no one  to turn to, like many other parents, explained Mr McLaughlin.They are the main reason we fundraise for the NICU at Altnagelvin and I think everyone agrees they deserve a thank you.They are our earth angels.The nurses in the Neonatal ward are highly trained and provide one to one care round the clock care for the babies.It is nice to let our nurses know that we appreciate them and everything they do for our children, continued Mr McLaughlin.We hope we put a smile on their faces.Earlier this week Saorlaith and Saoirse donned their Santa hats to pay a surprise visit to the ward where they were reunited with three of the nurses who had looked after them.One of the staff Oonagh hadnt seen the girls since they were born so I think she got a bit of a shock, said Mr McLaughlin.She recalled the sleepless nights she used to have worrying about the girls.Its lovely to know they remember them and shows how much they care and they were really pleased and grateful for the gts they received.Mr McLaughlin added: I would also like to thank all the local businesses who so generously donated to the raffle and the people who bought tickets and took part in our quiz night at the River Inn. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes across the Province, with the remainder of the cash expected to come from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.At this weekrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency and other key players..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements.

Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled.

The meeting was devoted to Emma de Souza, who is campaigning to have British citizenship law amended so that people from Northern Ireland would no longer be automatic British citizens. Letter to the editorShe argues that the provision in the Belfast Agreement that says that people from Northern Ireland may ‘identy as’ Irish or British or both means that British citizenship ought to be relegated to a mere choice. This is despite the same clause of the agreement referring only to a right to hold ‘both British and Irish citizenship’. In October, this argument was dismissed in a withering judgment of the Upper Tribunal , which also declined permission to appeal, but Mrs De Souza has stated her intention to go to the Court of Appeal and is currently fundraising for her legal costs..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The Joint Committee, three of the nine attending members of which were from Sinn Fein , invited Mrs De Souza to give evidence along with Professor Colin Harvey, a nationalist academic, and a representative of the Committee on the Administration of Justice. All three repeated arguments conflating identity and citizenship and asserting a non-existent ‘right’ to choose citizenship. These are based on a nationalist interpretation of the Belfast Agreement and an apparent inability to appreciate that it is as much a unionist creation as a nationalist one. Nobody had been invited to put the case for the interpretation of the Upper Tribunal, or to give a unionist view or indeed any kind of an alternative view. There were no dissenting voices among the committee members. Nobody present even contemplated the possibility that the tribunal may have been correct. All apparently believe that, in , unionists and the UK government agreed that British citizenship should no longer be the default for those born in Northern Ireland and that despite such an agreement, the UK government chose not to include this in the legislation that gave effect to the agreement, and nobody in Parliamentnoticed.The meeting ended with O Caolain, the Sinn Fein chairman of the Joint Committee, asserting that British taxpayers’ money was being used to ‘crush Irish rights’, and accepting a proposal by Gerry Adams that it should write to the Irish government, urging it to give practicalsupport to De Souza’s appeal.As predicted, the De Souza campaign is moving firmly into the political arena. Nationalism is exerting signicant pressure and recent remarks at a Westminster Committee by the Secretary of State Julian Smith — when he appeared to contemplate amendments to UK citizenship law — indicate that it might be working. What are unionist representatives doing to defend the extant interpretation of the Belfast Agreement and UK citizenship law from this campaign J.

Alliances Stephen Farry, pictured with party leader Naomi Long, stunned the DUP by taking North DownIn past elections unionist parties – and most recently the DUP – have talked up the constitutional threat for their own advantage. No longer.Now the future of the United Kingdom is imperilled from myriad directions – and some of those are entirely beyond Northern Irish unionists’ control..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The decisive national outcome of the general election leaves the DUP with no leverage at Westminster. As a consequence, it now faces a rapid move towards an Irish Sea trade border.Having backed Brexit as something which would improve things, the DUP now finds that for which it dreamt and campaigned threatening to unravel the Union itself.Brexit itself and the DUP’s support not only for leaving the EU, but for a harder form of Brexit, was a key factor in the de facto nationalist and Green Party pacts in North Belfast and South Belfast which cost it two seats.The loss in North Belfast of Nigel Dodds, the party’s Westminster leader and one of unionism’s elder statesmen, is devastating.On Thursday night as it became clear that his seat was in jeopardy, one DUP member sent me a message saying: “We could lose anyone but him.”Few people across the DUP’s disparate and frequently warring factions would disagree with that sentiment.Not only is he a strategic asset to the DUP and a respected figure at Westminster in a way that some of his DUP colleagues are not, but his defeat speaks to a profound psychological problem for unionism.This seat, once held by the father of Ulster Unionism, Edward Carson, has never been held by a nationalist before – still less by a republican.As such, Mr Dodds’ defeat represents an old certainty which now is slipping away from unionism.Joint committee of Irish Parliament engages in nationalist groupthink over the de Souza citizenship case Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And as the latest in a line of once impregnable unionist seats which have been lost by unionism, the result is evocative of a wider sense that not only control of Northern Ireland – but potentially Northern Ireland itself – is slipping away.There is no inevitability that a united Ireland is coming. Just four years ago, prior to Brexit and the collapse of Stormont, polls pointed to Northern Ireland being more constitutionally secure than at any point since its creation in .And even in this election, where unionism has suffered a grievous blow, Sinn Fein’s vote has fallen further than that of the DUP.The rise of the Alliance Party, astonishingly in this election the third largest party, is no guarantee of support for Irish unity.But it is a clear rejection of what has seemed like an archaic form of unionism whose biggest idea often seems to be to circle the wagons with an electoral pact when seats come under pressure.Yesterday the man who is seen by some DUP members as the great hope of unionism said something which appeared to misunderstand the core problem.Asked on Good Morning Ulster about the psychological damage of the result for unionism, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson referred to “the splintering of the unionist vote, for example, in places like North Down” and said that unionists wanted unity.It is a measure of how far unionism has fallen that a sentence like that can be uttered without drawing gasps.North Down is one of the safest unionist seats in Northern Ireland. Less than a decade ago, unionists won % of the votes there.If a unionist pact is required to stop it being lost, that is a pitul reflection on the state of the DUP and UUP.The logic of suggesting a pact in North Down is that there is almost no winnable seat which the UUP should contest without a pact.But while that would suit the DUP’s short-term interests – and perhaps even those of the UUPit gained a seat as a result – the evidence suggests that pacts are one of the reasons that Alliance is surging.Facing a developing fire, a move towards widespread unionist unity could act as an accelerant.Unlike nationalism, where Sinn Fein has – despite its major victory in North Belfast – had a poor election but has seen votes largely slip from it to the SDLP, this election has confirmed the complete dominance of the DUP within unionism.With that dominance comes responsibility when unionism falters.Will Arlene Foster accept that she is either accountable or responsible for any of this crisis  Or will she blame everyone but herself History suggests the latter, despite the fact that DUP members privately say that many voters expressed their unhappiness at Mrs Foster during canvassing.For a party renowned for its bare-toothed ruthlessness, the DUP has been remarkably understanding of the failures on Mrs Foster’s watch.There was an abortive putsch after she led unionism to the first loss of its Stormont majority in the history of Northern Ireland.Those who quietly muttered about challenging her then but chose not to do so must now wonderthey could have helped prevent this catastrophe for unionism.Unionism now lacks a strong leader at the point where it needs one most.Loyalists – including paramilitaries – poured into political activism their efforts at rejecting Boris Johnson’s Irish Sea border. Now that strategy has failed, where do they go Some, based on the recent meeting in Portadown from which my colleague Ben Lowry reported, will be arguing for street protests,not outright violence.Even setting aside moral considerations, past loyalist violence has been strategically disastrous and the street disorder during the flag protests actually boosted Alliance’s vote.Unionism stands weary at another crossroads. But unlike the choice between Terence O’Neill’s moderation and the full-throated unionism of Paisleyism  years ago, this time the possibility of a vote for Irish unity is more real than many then could conceive.And this time there is a sense of unionism lacking a single leader with the ability and ideological purpose to even lead unionist opinion – let alone those now deserting unionism.try catch  TrendingNI snow now due to arrive earlier than originally thought -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

That can only mean one thing – the dreaded hangover.We’ve all been there, right  That last round of tequila shots sounded like a mighty fine idea, but now it’s the morning after the night before and you are paying for it – with interest.Your head is pounding, your stomach is queasy, and it feels like something small and furry crawled into your mouth overnight and died there.Granted, the damage has well and truly been done – but what can you do about it now  How do you cure that hangover  Heck, can you even cure a hangover Well, that depends on who you ask. There’s a host of weird and wonderful hangover cure claims floating around, but the old saying ‘horses for courses’ applies here. That is to say, what works for one person may not do a thing for another.At the risk of stating the obvious, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less alcohol. Or none at all.It’s also a very good idea to eat a decent meal before heading out, and alternating between an alcoholic beverage and a hydrating glass of water can lessen the effects of a hangover.Assuming, though, that all that sage advice went out of the window last night, here’s six hangover cures to try.A hearty bowl of soupOkay, so this is only a good ideayou can still stand straight, but Austrians swear by this method.When you’ve had a skinful of booze, grab a big bowl of goulash soup before heading to bed.It will prevent the alcohol soaking further into your bloodstream, and is always a better idea than that kebab you were craving at am.Eat a protein breakfastDr Andrew Irvine, who published How To Cure A Hangover, suggests a simple breakfast.“Protein, in the form of eggs, will help your hypoglycaemia , as will porridge,” he says. “The headache should ease once the blood sugar level has been corrected, then take some soluble paracetamol.”BeroccaThe Aussies, it’s fair to say, seem know a thing or two about drinking.After one too many tinnies, simply drop a tablet of this over-the-counter, nutrient-packed tablet in a glass of water.Works bestyou do the same before drinking. It may not completely cure your hangover, but it’s a refreshing pick-me-up that’s packed with vitamins.ParacetamolDissolve a soluble paracetamol tablet in a glass of water and not only will it go a long way towards curing that throbbing headache, but it will provide rehydration, which is all important. Unlike Ibuprofen it won’t irritate the stomach.Be warned, though: too much paracetamol is toxic to the liver – and it has probably taken enough of a pounding as it is. and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are foods you shouldnt feed your dog christmas ","story":"This is why Friday th is considered to be unluckyYou could be owed a Cold Weather Payment thanks to the dip in temperatures - how to checkyou’re eligibleNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleThe ethanol in alcohol can hit an animals bloodstream faster than humans.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
