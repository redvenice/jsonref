Bush missed in 1989 and Bill Clinton in 1994 because of travel in Europe. First ladies attended on their behalf.There was speculation Melania Trump might attend without her husband but that never happened. The Trumps skipped the three ceremonies held during their tenures. The 2020 ceremony was postponed because of the COVID pandemic and was held earlier this year in May.For that hybrid Honors in May - which featured socially distanced performances during a week-long taping - the Bidens welcomed the honorees during a reception at the White House but did not attend any of the performances.The mood on Sunday evening is expected to be festive and collegial, a wave of relief after the controversial Trump years where there was genuine fear the bipartisan event - attended by Democrats and Republicans alike - would become a victim to politics.  Safety measures will be in place due to the coronavirus pandemic. Anyone attended must be vaccinated and must be tested ahead of time. But, in another COVID-related modification, the traditional Saturday night supper - where the honorees receive their medallions on rainbow-colored ribbon - was shifted from the State Department to the Library of Congress. All five honorees attended Saturday\u0027s black-tie event. Others in attendance included Martin Short, dance veteran and former honoree Debbie Allen, SNL player Fred Armisen, and Schitt\u0027s Creek star Dan Levy. "},{"url":null,"title":"Just 20 children aged 12 15 Covid vaccine parts London","story":"Share this article   Health Secretary Sajid Javid also announced GPs would be free from making some routine health checks to allow them time to help with the booster rollout.But it is understood many of those who helped administer first and second vaccine jabs have opted out of home visits to deliver boosters, citing the lack of time and staff.In areas including Kent, London and Cambridgeshire responsibility for visiting housebound people has been given to local NHS clinical commissioning groups or pharmacy firms.Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: \u0027The general clunkiness which has affected the booster rollout seems to have resulted in some housebound older people still waiting for a nurse to provide them with their booster jab.\u0027This would have been worrying in any situation, but is all the more so now because of the potential threat from the new omicron variant.Last week the JCVI — Britain\u0027s vaccine watchdog — dramatically expanded the inoculation drive to offer 39 to 18-year-olds a third dose amid mounting concern that the country could face a fourth Omicron wave.Estimates show, however, that if the drive continues at the current pace of 378,000 inoculations a day then everyone will not be offered a top up until February."},{"url":null,"title":"Boris refuses rule tougher Covid curbs Christmas","story":"Share this article   James Ward, a mathematical modeller from Surrey, said there could be up to 20,000 Omicron hospital admissions in a single week in January, based on assumptions about how fast it\u0027s spreading in South African and presuming it\u0027s more mild than Delta. Professor Hunter, from the school of medicine at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Breakfast: \u0027How it\u0027s likely to spread in the UK still uncertain, but I think the early signs are that it will probably spread quite quickly and probably start outcompeting Delta and become the dominant variant probably within the next weeks or a month or so at least.\u0027The big remaining question is actually how harmful it is if you do get Covid with this Omicron variant, and that\u0027s the question that we\u0027re struggling to answer at the moment.\u0027He said travel restrictions would have a minor impact, adding that \u0027one of the problems with travel restrictions like this is that it then de-motivates other countries to actually be open about their own situations for fear of what they would see as economic sanctions.

I know the people involved have been trying for years.That’s a nice phrase. Funnily enough, last December Chelsea were the kiss-of-life team for both Everton and Arsenal.I don’t watch him as often, but I can see why managers are seduced by him. It’s almost a rescue fantasy. He has most of the tools you need to be a quality No6 the problem is that he picks the wrong one too often. I know Xhaka can be a liability, but I doubt even he could manage a two-footed challenge into someone.It’s going to penalties?It always tickles me when supporters of big clubs reach for the nuclear pessimism of potential relegation. There is about as much chance of Everton going down as there was of Leicester winning the Premier League.I wish someone had a camera on Alan Davies when he clocked the teamsheet. His loathehate relationship with Xhaka on the Tuesday Club podcast never fails to tickle me. The reaction to his sending off at Manchester City earlier in the season - especially the haunted “I can’t” at around 5m25s - is wonderful.In case you missed it, Everton are away to Hull and Arsenal have a trip to the City Ground. Arsenal make four changes from their defeat at Old Trafford: Kieran Tierney, Granit Xhaka, Alexandre Lacazette and Bukayo Saka replace Nuno Tavares, Mohamed Elneny, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Emile Smith Rowe. The first three are on the bench Smith Rowe isn’t in the squad. Even by the standards of modern football, this has escalated with indecent haste. Everton went into the October international break in fifth place, two points behind the leaders Chelsea, and even Gary Neville was blowing smoke up Rafa’s fundamental principles. Their record since then is unpolishable: seven games, six defeats, one point and apparently no hope. There’s a mutinous atmosphere at Goodison Park. The director of football Marcel Brands left yesterday and supporters are planning to walk out of the ground in the 27th minute in protest at the board.  Depending on your viewpoint, Everton’s opponents tonight are a great advert for giving a manager time, or a terrible advert for giving a manager time. After almost two years, opinion is still split on the merits of Mikel Arteta. He has built a likeable team, full of charismatic young players, but they keep hitting a wall in the biggest games.  Their season so far has been the opposite of Everton’s. They had a hideous start, after which Arteta found himself where Benitez is now, as the odds-on favourite to be the next Premier League manager invited to do one. But they’ve won seven of their last 11 in the league, and another victory tonight would move them up to fifth. A win for Everton would lift them from 16th to 12th, and they have a decent run of fixtures coming up. After tonight, only one of the next 11 games is against a Big Six team or West Ham, a collective also known in some cultures as ‘the top seven’. A few good results wouldn’t resolve Everton’s long-term problems, but they might buy Benitez more time to try to fix them. If Rafa’s got anything about him, he’ll let Boethius do the team talk tonight.

Republican congressman Ken Buck, a member of the House foreign affairs committee, added, “I applaud President Biden for refusing to send American diplomats to the Beijing Olympics in February, and I hope every freedom-loving nation joins the US. Genocide must not be rewarded.” House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced the honor in a joint statement released this afternoon. “Senator Dole was an extraordinary patriot, who devoted his entire life to serving our nation with dignity and integrity,” Pelosi said.  “Senator Dole exemplified the greatest generation, and while I never had the pleasure of serving in the Senate with him, his reputation and his achievements, and most of all his character preceded him,” Schumer added.  Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said, “Those of us who were lucky to know Bob well ourselves admired him even more.” According to Pelosi and Schumer’s statement, the Capitol will hold a formal arrival and departure ceremony for Dole’s casket. Because of coronavirus precautions, the ceremony will only be open to invited guests. “As early as we can get it,” the president told reporters. “I want to get it done no matter how long it takes.” Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said this morning that he still wants the upper chamber to pass the $2tn social spending package by Christmas. “Our goal in the Senate is to pass the legislation before Christmas and get it to the president’s desk,” the Democratic leader said in a letter to colleagues. “I will continue to remind you that there are more long days and nights, and potentially weekends, that the Senate will be in session this month.”The president noted that some drugs are far more costly in the US when the same exact treatments are available at a lower price in other nations. One anti-cancer drug that costs $14,000 in the US is sold for $6,000 in France, even though it is distributed by the same manufacturer in both nations. “We can agree that prescription drugs are outrageously expensive in this country,” Biden said. “Doesn’t need be that way.” Texas Republicans, who control the redistricting process, drew the lines to shore up their advantage across the state, blunting the surge in the state’s non-white population. The suit says Texas violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. “The complaint that we filed today alleges that Texas violated Section 2 by creating redistricting plans that deny or abridge the rights of Latino and Black voters to vote on account of their race, color or membership in a language or minority group,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said during a press conference. Vanita Gupta, the number three official at the Justice Department, noted that some of the districts were drawn with “discriminatory intent.” She also noted that Texas is a repeat offender when it comes to voting discrimination, highlighting that courts have repeatedly found that the state has discriminated against minority voters over the last several decades. This is the first redistricting lawsuit the Justice Department has filed this year. Last week, the Department made filings in three cases challenging new voting restrictions in Arizona, Texas, and Florida, defending the scope of Section 2. “We believe US athletes, people who have been training, giving up a lot of blood, sweat and tears preparing for these Olympics, should be able to go and compete, and we look forward to cheering for them from home,” Psaki said. The press secretary argued the diplomatic boycott clearly demonstrated that the US would not treat the games as “business as usual” in light of China’s human rights abuses. The last time the US staged a full boycott of the Olympics was during the cold war in 1980, when the former president Jimmy Carter snubbed the Moscow summer Games along with 64 other countries and territories. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, on Monday accused Washington of “hyping a ‘diplomatic boycott’ without even being invited to the Games”. “I want to stress that the Winter Olympic Games is not a stage for political posturing and manipulation,” Zhao said. “It is a grave travesty of the spirit of the Olympic charter, a blatant political provocation and a serious affront to the 1.4 billion Chinese people.” The US diplomatic boycott comes amid escalating tensions between China and many western countries. It was first raised by Joe Biden last month when he said he was considering a “diplomatic boycott” as pressures grew in the US Congress over its concerns about China’s human rights record, including over the treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.  Politicians including Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, have advocated a boycott as protest. “The Biden administration will not send any diplomatic or official representation to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games, given the PRC’s ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses,” Psaki said from the briefing room podium. The announcement comes two months before the games are set to begin. American athletes are still expected to compete in the Olympics, even as the Biden administration will not be sending any representatives to Beijing. Psaki said the White House determined it would be wrong to deny athletes the opportunity to compete in the games, and she argued the lack of a diplomatic delegation would still send a “clear message” about the administration’s priorities.“Wow, it looks like highly respected Senator David Perdue will be running against RINO Brian Kemp for Governor of Georgia. David was a great Senator, and he truly loves his State and his Country,” the former president said in a new statement. “This will be very interesting, and I can’t imagine that Brian Kemp, who has hurt election integrity in Georgia so badly, can do well at the ballot box (unless the election is rigged, of course).” Trump has repeatedly criticized Kemp for refusing to attempt to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in Georgia, and he had encouraged Purdue to launch a primary challenge against the incumbent governor.Hiatt died in New York, where he suffered a heart attack while visiting his daughter in late November. A statement from Post publisher Fred Ryan, widely shared by Post staffers, said in part: “All of us who worked with Fred know what a deep loss this is and how profoundly he’ll be missed.  “Over the past two decades, Fred’s leadership made the Post editorial page into the most consequential in the news industry. Nearly every person in the department was hired by Fred a great testament to his ability to identify and retain top talent.  “A 40-year veteran of the post, he built friendships through the company and made immense contributions as a writer and editor and a mentor to so many.” Among responses, Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent of the rival New York Times wrote: “Devastating news. Fred was a first-rate journalist, smart and incisive, gentle but strong, open minded and thoughtful but never fooled by the propagandists of Washington or Moscow. Most of all, he was the epitome of decency and principle in an indecent and unprincipled age.”Joe Biden and Vladmir Putin are due to talk tomorrow. We’ll have more soon.

Photograph: Bryan O BrienNew advice to schools issued by the Department of Education this morning has stressed that children in third class and above should not be excluded from schools “in the first instance” for not wearing masks. Instead, it says, the school should engage with the parents and, if no progress is made, then an inspector from the Department of Education will be contacted. The new guidance also says that where a school agrees with parents that a mask is not appropriate for the child, no medical certification is needed for an exemption.The guidance amends rules on mask wearing introduced at short notice last week which said that unmasked pupils in third class upwards will be refused entry to their school if they do not have a medical certificate to show they are exempt from the rules.As part of the changes children aged nine and over are also required to wear masks on public transport and in retail and other indoor public settingsThe guidance says any pupil with difficulty breathing or other relevant medical conditions are exempt from wearing face maskscoverings. A pupil who is unable to remove the cloth face maskcovering or visor without assistance is also exempt along with children who have special needs or those with intellectual or developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.“It should also be noted that where a school is aware, having consulted with the parent that a child’s needs are such that mask-wearing is not appropriate, no medical certification is needed,” the advisory states. ImpedimentVisors should be considered where face masks present an impediment to communication for pupils with a hearing impairment. Schools are asked to use their judgement in such cases. It is recognised that wearing a face mask for long durations can be “challenging” for young children. Schools are advised to arrange regular breaks and facilitate children taking a break outdoors where possible.Pupils do not have to wear a mask while eating their lunch at their desks or taking a drink during class.In instances where classes are mixed, and a class comprises of pupils in third class and second class or a lower class, only pupils in third class are required to wear face masks.It is not necessary for pupils to wear a face mask while engaged in PE (physical education), the guidance states. “Physical education should be outdoors if the weather permits. Indoor spaces should be ventilated well,” it adds.Pupils are not required to wear a mask while singing or playing a musical instrument but should remain in pods and be socially distant. The advisory explains that the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has advised that the wearing of face masks is being introduced on a temporary basis and is subject to review in mid-February 2022.The Irish College of General Practitioners representative on Nphet, Dr Mary Favier, said on Friday morning that GPs welcomed the policy of mask wearing by school children as they were another layer of protection against the spread of the virus.There was no one solution for stopping the spread of Covid-19, she told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. “Masks are one part of that.”The extension of mask wearing to schools had been welcome and children had shown they were willing to wear them, she said. The high numbers of children being tested at present was to be expected, she said, as they were not vaccinated. Testing would give a better idea of the level of the virus in the community and GPs had been referring children for testing to rule out respiratory infections and flu, she explained.It was important for anyone with symptoms to self isolate and book a PCR test, she urged. There were no dates yet for the extension of the vaccination campaign for children aged five years to 11 years, she said, but GPs were always enthusiastic about vaccines.ConcernHowever, Dr Favier expressed concern about the decline in referrals for non Covid illnesses especially lung, breast and prostate cancer. If people had a long term cough or lumps it was “particularly important” for them to have them checked out. “Make those appointments”.Meanwhile, the principal of a national school in Co Tipperary says there was full compliance at her school this morning with mask wearing.Louise Tobin, principal of St Joseph’s in Tipperary town, told RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show that there had been great relief among teachers and principals at the withdrawal of the requirement that children not wearing masks be excluded from school.It was something with which she was not comfortable, she added. As a principal she did not ever want to exclude a child from school. This was now a “softer approach” with a more sensitive use of language, she added.Masks did not now have to be worn in the yard during break or when singing or playing instruments indoors provided there was good ventilation and the children were one metre apart, she said.The speed with which the new mask wearing measures had been introduced last week had raised many practical questions, added Ms Tobin. There always had to be a lead in time with young children, and she had seen some levels of anxiety and self consciousness among some children. Ms Tobin said she had explained to the children that the masks were needed to keep them safe in school.There had been full compliance with mask wearing this morning apart from a few children who forgot their masks, which the school then provided. They were adult masks as child-sized masks were sold out.

Photograph: Brian FarrellIt is over 430 years since monks put quill to parchment on an island in Lough Key, Co Roscommon, but the tradition of hand-written chronicling of church and global affairs is being revived.The return of the annals, which began with Eusebius in Constantinople in AD 303, was marked on Trinity Island on Lough Key at the weekend. The location was chosen because the last entry to the Annals of Lough Key was made there in 1590. The team reviving the annals, who are based at the nearby Brú Moytura cultural centre in Co Sligo, hope to engage with the public by inviting them to suggest events for inclusion in the modern-day annals.Colum Stapleton, curator of Brú Moytura, who is spearheading the project, said the quietness of the scene where the monks compiled the annals centuries ago made the weekend visit special.“Seeing the abbey through the trees, it was amazing to think that it is still there intact, a connection from then until now.”CommissionedThe Trinity Island monks who chronicled events from the early 15th century to 1590 were commissioned by their patrons, the McDermotts, who lived on nearby Castle Island, also on Lough Key. Mr Stapleton said they hope in time to “fill the gap”, and write up the “missing 432 years”. The missing history will be recorded on handmade parchment paper by “scribes” using natural ink made from berries and plants, and written with a nod to medieval calligraphy.“No calves will be killed in the doing so it’s parchment not vellum,” said Mr Stapleton, who built Brú Moytura, formerly the Gyreum eco lodge, on the Moytura plateau in 2000. An annals crowdfunding campaign will be launched in 2022 while groups such as colleges and families will be invited to sponsor a “missing year”.Over the centuries the annals chronicled major and local events, first in Greek and later in Latin and Irish, providing accounts of invasions and pestilence, petty feuds and Church affairs. Not surprisingly the 2020 annals, already written by the Brú Moytura “scribes”, contain references to the Covid-19 pandemic.The northwest of Ireland has a rich history of chronicling times past as well as the Annals of Lough Key, other manuscripts associated with the region include the Annals of Boyle, of Ballymote, of Fenagh, two of Lecan (Enniscrone), as well as the Annals of Ulster.The acclaimed Annals of the Four Masters were not a continuum of the works of Eusebius.Biblical timesMr Stapleton said one of the more remarkable stories contained in the ancient annals links Co Sligo with biblical times. It recounts how Noah’s granddaughter Cessair landed by boat at Milk Harbour, Streedagh, accompanied by 49 women followers and one man. “The accounts say she took the boat to Sligo because there was no place in the original ark for her.”The formal welcome of the annals was conducted by archaeologist Dr Brian Lacey. “The writing of our ancient annals transformed Ireland from a pre-historic culture to one based on written evidence,” he said.Mr Stapleton said a debt was owed to TCD academic Dr Dan McCarthy, author of The Genesis and Evolution of the Irish Annals( 2008) and The Irish Annals (2009) for the many insights he provided. Participating in the launch by Zoom, Dr McCarthy said he was delighted this “remarkable heritage” was being introduced to a wider audience.Referencing the Covid-19 pandemic, he added: “There are records in the annals of pandemics which were far worse than this – one where 50 per cent of the population perished. So it holds up the hope that society survived and indeed flourished after much more severe pandemics.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donegal town dealing with mica if it was in dublin this would already be fixed","story":"Moville, on Donegal’s Inishowen peninsula, is among the worst affected areas in the country for mica and for the students in Moville Community College, the subject is rarely far from their minds.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"no significant increase in checking of covid certs esri research finds","story":"An almost equal proportion of vaccinated and unvaccinated people report sitting inside in pubs and restaurants, despite public health rules requiring proof of inoculation or immunity, new research shows.The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) published its latest social activity measure, which examined the week of November 16th-23rd. A nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults participated in the study.It found that despite an increase in the percentage of people dining indoors, there has been no increase in how often Covid certs are checked.Since August, about 27 per cent of those sitting indoors at pubs and restaurants have reported that their Covid certs were not checked, with the corresponding number for cafes being 32 per cent.However, the ESRI acknowledges the total numbers dining indoors at all of these venues has been low, so “it is possible that small changes in Covid cert checking rates have not been detected”. The head of the ESRI’s behavioural unit, Prof Pete Lunn, on Monday told RTÉ radio it was unlikely the percentage of certs getting checked had changed significantly in recent weeks.Between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents reported sitting indoors in pubs and restaurants the day before the survey in November, the think-tank found, while fewer unvaccinated people sat indoors in cafes.People who have been fully vaccinated were more likely to visit a cafe, pub or restaurant, but unvaccinated people who went to a cafe, pub or restaurant tended to go to slightly more of them than vaccinated people did.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Prof Lunn said that, when cafes were included, the proportion of unvaccinated people going indoors to cafes, pubs and restaurants was “a little over half the proportion of the vaccinated”.While unvaccinated people were not getting into as many pubs and restaurants as vaccinated people were, they were “clearly” finding places that they could get in, he said.The research found members of the public appear to be more conscious of Covid-19 in the community, with a “small but significant” increase in caution, and a reduction in close contacts.“More people now are engaging in mitigative behaviours (keeping their distance, washing hands and wearing masks) than at the start of November,” the ESRI found.“The increase is not extensive, but the percentage of the population who report engaging in these behaviours most of the time has returned to its highest level since May. Meanwhile, there has been a drop in the percentage who report rarely or never engaging in these behaviours.”Worry about Covid-19 has seen a sharp rise over the last two months, reaching its highest level since May.People are most worried about the healthcare system, which has an average score of 5.8 out of 7, the ESRI said.There has also been a steep increase in the percentage of the population that thinks the Government’s response to the pandemic is insufficient, rising from 18 per cent in the beginning of October to 44 per cent this round.The research data indicated Covid-19 and the associated restrictions have had a major impact on people’s wellbeing, particularly among younger adults.The data suggests that younger adults are the most likely people in society at the moment to feel loneliness, more likely than older adults.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics the life and legacy of charles j haughey with professor gary murphy","story":"Depending on who you ask, Charles J.

Photograph: Daniel McLaughlinIn a cemetery beside a mosque on the outskirts of Nazran, a small city in the republic of Ingushetia at the foot of the Caucasus mountains, stand 192 unusual headstones.Only a name and date of birth are carved on each one, because these graves await people whose precise fate is unknown, but who are presumed dead after vanishing during the first conflict to erupt in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union.The fighting in late 1992 between Muslim Ingush and mostly Orthodox Christian Ossetians lasted for only six days, but continues to taint relations between their republics today, and left another knot of pain and anger in Caucasus history that is scarred by centuries of violence, oppression and unresolved grievances.“Twenty-four of my relatives were killed or disappeared,” says Ayub Tsurov, who manages the memorial cemetery and for nearly 30 years has led efforts to find the remains of Ingush victims in neighbouring North Ossetia and bring them here for burial.“The official investigative agencies and prosecutors said they were looking for the missing, but in fact they hardly did anything . . . We have approximate information on the places where people are buried, but there is no response to our appeals from that side. They don’t want to work with us on this,” he explains.“I saw with my own eyes . . . how armoured vehicles came in, and then marauders or militiamen or whatever you want to call them stole what they could and destroyed our homes,” recalls Tsurov, who was held hostage for 1½ months in North Ossetia until a prisoner exchange was agreed.“I know who took me – he grew up with me, we were at school together. I’ve told investigators everything – who took me, in what car, how it happened, who took my brothers – but there’s no reaction. They just make excuses,” he says.ResentmentThe fighting killed about 600 people, most of them Ingush, and drove tens of thousands of Ingush from the Prigorodny district of North Ossetia, which borders Ingushetia. Many still cannot return to their homes, compounding resentment over the failure of North Ossetian and Russian authorities to punish crimes committed in October and November 1992, or to find and return the remains of the missing.“Silence won’t get us anywhere,” Tsurov says. “But if we resolve this it will help people get over it, people will calm down and the atmosphere will be totally different.”Tension rose last month after at least three fights between Ossetians and Ingush in North Ossetia. No one was badly hurt, but the way these relatively minor incidents were swiftly blamed on inter-ethnic enmity, stoking local political alarm and anger on social media, showed there is still heat in a dispute that is rooted deep in Soviet history.A century after Russia fought to conquer the Caucasus and bring its mostly Muslim population into the Tsarist empire, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ordered the mass deportation to Siberia and Central Asia of several entire nations, on the pretext that they had allegedly aided the German invasion of the country in 1941.In early 1944, more than half a million Ingush and Chechen people were transported, many in wooden cattle cars, to remote and inhospitable tracts of steppe, thousands of miles from their homeland in and around the soaring Caucasus.After his death in 1953, the Soviet authorities denounced Stalin’s most heinous crimes and cleared the deported nations of the slur of Nazi collaboration, but forced expulsion and exile had already killed hundreds of thousands of their people.When the Ingush were allowed to go home in 1957, they found the fertile farmland of Prigorodny district had been transferred to North Ossetia and settled by Ossetians who moved there – sometimes on Soviet orders – after the deportations. Many Ingush returned, but the issue became a flashpoint between the nations.Moscow ruled in 1991 that the district should return to Ingush control, but North Ossetia did not comply, and amid the spreading chaos that followed the implosion of the Soviet Union that same year, Ossetians and Ingush took up arms and began killing and kidnapping each other.Favoured nationFederal troops arrived to end the fighting but did nothing to reverse the expulsion of the Ingush, reinforcing a perception here that Russia’s favoured nation in the Caucasus are the Ossetians, a largely Orthodox Christian people who were less hostile to the Tsarist takeover of the region than many of their Muslim neighbours.A much bigger crisis was already brewing just to the east in Chechnya, where from 1994-96 and again from 1999-2000, Russian forces would battle militants whose fight for independence came to be dominated by Islamist extremists, spawning a terror campaign across the North Caucasus and elsewhere in Russia.The devastating wars killed hundreds of thousands of civilians in Chechnya, and in 1999 about 200,000 Chechens fled to Ingushetia, which also suffered gun and bomb attacks as the war and anti-terror operation spilled over onto its territory.Despite the two nations’ history of close ties and shared suffering, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov – whose own reign of terror has helped the Kremlin crush resistance in his homeland – pushed through a deal in 2018 to take up to 10 per cent of Ingush land, sparking big protests in the region that police violently dispersed.The agreement remains unacceptable to many Ingush, and amid their fresh criticism of the pact and other border disputes, Kadyrov ordered his powerful security forces to conduct manoeuvres on the Chechnya-Ingushetia frontier late last month.He is also “absolutely sure” that Moscow will not allow serious conflict between Ingushetia and North Ossetia, but sees disturbing signs online of the anger still simmering in society.“There’s already something like a war taking place on social media,” Akiev says of the response to the recent fights between Ossetians and Ingush.“I see from comments on both sides that the conflict hasn’t disappeared. It’s alive, it’s still there like a dormant volcano, just waiting to explode with the same degree of hate,” he warns.“Our main criticism of the authorities is that they are doing nothing to solve this and improve relations . . . starting with programmes for children, so they don’t grow up with this hostility,” Akiev explains, highlighting work that Memorial has done to aid small businesses for Ossetians and Ingush in Prigorodny district.“The federal authorities don’t need any border conflicts and will do all they can to avert that. But I hope at some stage they won’t just prevent conflict with force – again driving people underground – but will actually deal fundamentally with the problem and help people make peace.”Political controlIn Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia, prominent local blogger Alik Pukhaev also sees Moscow relying on tight political and security control to maintain stability in the Caucasus, rather than major investment to lift the whole area out of poverty.“There are some simple decisions that could be taken on a local level quickly, but when the authorities try to hold back and freeze all processes, then of course tension emerges,” he says.“Tension between people in the Caucasus, not just between Ossetians and Ingush, and lots of other local problems would be removed by economic growth, by development of business, by development of civil ties – it would solve everything in a few decades, but it’s not happening,” Pukhaev adds.The official North Ossetian view of the 1992 fighting is that brave defenders of the republic fought off an unprovoked attack by vengeful and land-hungry Ingush extremists.Memory of the clashes retains less pain and power here than in Ingushetia, partly because Ossetians effectively won the conflict and suffered far fewer losses than the Ingush, but also because a later act of violence inflicted deep trauma on this society.In September 2004, Islamist militants seized a school in Beslan, 25km north of Vladikavkaz, and took more than 1,000 people hostage. The three-day siege ended in explosions and a chaotic gun battle between the attackers and security forces, which left 333 hostages dead, including at least 180 children.Most of the militants were from Ingushetia and Chechnya, and one theory holds that they hoped their attack would spark all-out war between Christians and Muslims in the Caucasus.Federal forces were deployed to counter the threat of wider violence, but the subsequent disappearance and suspected murder of more than 20 Ingush in North Ossetia is thought to have been the work of local vigilantes.“The history of Ossetia is ided into before and after Beslan,” says Pukhaev, standing by the Terek river that rushes down from the mountains and bisects Vladikavkaz.“This had such a powerful effect on the minds and souls of people here . . . It was an unbearable event.”In Nazran, just 25km east of Beslan, Akiev says the attack “was also seen here as a terrible tragedy. Ingush society absolutely distanced itself from those who did this.”Best friendsOn the road between the two towns, builder and part-time taxi driver Rolan tells a very different story of Caucasus life, of how he – an ethnic Armenian – grew up in Georgia, just over the mountains from Vladikavkaz, with an Azeri and an Ossetian as his best friends at school.“They live in Vladikavkaz now. When I moved to Russia eight years ago, they welcomed me so warmly that I decided not to continue on to Moscow. So I settled down here with my wife and child. When we feel nostalgic we drive through the mountains and spend a couple of days in Tbilisi and in Rustavi, where we grew up.“When we were young, no one talked about who belonged to which nationality,” Rolan says. “All that started in the 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed and conflicts began. We were all just Soviet kids.”Such harmony is much harder to imagine now, after post-Soviet wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan and between Georgia and Russian-backed separatists in South Ossetia.The same Soviet Union that gave Rolan his happy childhood condemned several Caucasus nations to bitter exile, however. Among the Ingush exiles were the parents of Tsurov, who spent his early years in a remote village in Central Asia.“I was born in Kazakhstan after my parents were exiled in 1944. Then in 1992 I was expelled . . . from my home,” Tsurov says at the cemetery in Nazran.“Every year we mourn here on October 30th, the day fighting began in 1992, so the dead and the missing are not forgotten,” he adds.“We need to find the missing and allow them to be buried. If we don’t, it will be a permanent stumbling block between Ingush and Ossetians. The sooner we remove it, the better it will be for them, for us and for Russia - for everyone.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"History of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo role"},{"url":null,"title":"initial data on omicron s severity is encouraging says fauci","story":"Anthony Fauci: “If you get boosted . . . we feel certain that there will be some degree and maybe a considerable degree of protection against the Omicron variant if in fact it starts to take hold in a dominant way in this country.” Photograph: Jim Lo ScalzoEPABloombergEarly signals about the severity of the new Omicron coronavirus variant are “encouraging”, according to a top US health official, with booster jabs potentially offering a “considerable degree” of protection.Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, acknowledged on Sunday that it was too soon to know the full consequences of the new strain that is spreading globally, but he was optimistic about the initial data. Omicron has generated significant alarm since its emergence less than two weeks ago in South Africa and Botswana.“We really gotta be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe or really doesn’t cause any severe illness comparable to Delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging,” he said in an interview with CNN. “It does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it.”Now detected in about 40 countries and in at least 15 US states, Omicron was designated a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization soon after its identification. The strain has an unusually high number of genetic mutations that may mean it is more easily transmissible and more likely to bypass the protection provided by vaccines or previous infections.The Biden administration imposed travel restrictions on eight African countries – measures that mirrored those of European leaders and drew a sharp rebuke from the WHO, who said they “place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods”.Dr Fauci said on Sunday that those bans were being re-evaluated “on a daily basis” and that he hoped the US would be able to lift them “within a quite reasonable period of time”.The White House announced additional measures last week in a bid to stop the spread of the variant, including free rapid tests, an extended mask mandate on public transport and tighter testing requirements for international travellers.Booster jabsOfficials have also repeatedly encouraged vaccinated Americans to get the booster jab – a message again repeated by Dr Fauci and other top officials on Sunday.“Boosters are going to be really critical in addressing whether or not we’re going to be able to handle this,” he said. “If you get boosted . . . we feel certain that there will be some degree and maybe a considerable degree of protection against the Omicron variant if in fact it starts to take hold in a dominant way in this country.”Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged people to get vaccinated and take precautionary measures but stopped short of supporting a nationwide mask mandate.“I would rather see people get vaccinated, boosted and follow our recommendations. I’d rather not have requirements in order to do so,” she told ABC News. “People should do this for themselves.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"astrazeneca vaccines unlucky","story":"“I would just like them to hold their hand up and say, ‘we’re very much aware that this has happened and we’re going to do something about it’. And I’d like them to do that without taking it away in the next breath.“In no other circumstances where so many people have lost their lives would that happen. They wouldn’t say 72 people sadly died in the Grenfell tower fire, but hundreds of people didn’t. We don’t forget those who were wounded in conflict or those who did not come home.”These are the words of Gareth Eve, husband of Lisa Shaw, the 44 year-old BBC Radio Newcastle presenter who died in May of a rare brain hemorrhage, confirmed by a coroner in August to have been caused by rare complications from the Oxford AstraZeneca jab which scientists believe they discovered the trigger for last week.His is a tough story to hear, but it is made worse by being so hard for him to tell publicly.Gareth and hundreds of others in the UK who have lost loved ones, or seen their lives irrevocably changed by blood clots and other vaccine-related injuries, find themselves in a terrible position as the real stories behind the statistics.Not only are they being forced to battle for the lives, memories or continued care of their partners or children but – although it could not be further from the truth – they know that doing so risks them being branded as anti-vaxxers or even unpatriotic.“Lisa rolled her sleeve up for the country and said, ‘Right, well, I’m going to get my jab, because that’s what we are being told is the right thing to do’,” says Gareth, who had his second vaccination after his wife’s death, and is now bringing up the couple’s six-year-old son Zach alone. “She did it, like all the others, because it would mean that our little bit of the world, our family and community was better protected. And yet nobody even recognises them”.The number of people who have life-changing adverse reactions to vaccines for Covid-19 is a tiny proportion of the many millions of vaccines given, but is mounting in absolute numbers. (the exact percentage is not known)Up to November 17, the MHRA had received Yellow Card reports of 426 cases of major thromboembolic events (blood clots) with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the UK following vaccination with AstraZeneca. The overall case fatality rate was 17 per cent with 73 deaths. There have been, in addition, a small number of other rare adverse reactions which have led to death or disablement – as there are with nearly all pharmaceuticals.Sarah Moore, a partner with the London law firm Hausfeld, represents the families of 95 people impacted by such injuries, including Gareth Eve. Nine have suffered bereavement, while most of the others are caring for close relatives with life-changing injuries. “All have experienced, at first hand, a range of severe adverse health events following Covid-19 vaccination,” she says.When Covid vaccines were first authorised for use in the UK, the Government indemnified the manufacturers and took on liability for any adverse reactions. It then added all of the jabs used – including the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine – to the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme (VDPS).“The UK has one of the most comprehensive immunisation programmes in the world, and sensible routine precautions such as these form a huge part of our global-leading standards in safety,” boasted the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, when announcing the move just ahead of the launch of the Covid vaccination campaign in December 2020.“The VDPS is a safety net to help ease the burden on iniduals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, experienced harm due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine,” added the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at the time.Moore and her clients are not anti-vaccination or suing the government, but campaigning for change: they say the VDPS is not a “safety net” worthy of the name.Launched more than 40 years ago to build confidence in national vaccination programmes, it is now hopelessly out of date – and in danger of doing the exact opposite.Paper-based and under-staffed, it has proven slow, bureaucratic and unresponsive. Claimants must show they are more than “60 per cent” disabled to make a successful claim as well as proving “causation”, which is notoriously difficult to prove. Worse, even for cases that are successful, the maximum total payout is just £120,000.“While £120,000 is a substantial sum of money, it will provide limited security where an inidual has been severely disabled and, particularly, where they may have dependents,” says Moore. “It is significantly lower than the awards that are achieved in personal injury claims involving similarly severe injuries.” Such awards can run to the millions.Historically, the VDPS has received about 100 claims a year, but Covid vaccinations mean that number has dramatically increased.“There are currently c.500 cases (as at November 2021) that require assessment, with this volume currently increasing per week by c.20 cases,” notes a recent government tender document for the running of the service. “It is estimated that in year one of the contract there will be c1500-1800 claims that will require assessment within the first year of the contract,” it adds.Kate Scott, a 32-year-old mum of two boys, age four and one, is one of those claimants. She is struggling to keep the roof over the family’s head after her husband Jamie, 44, suffered a brain injury after receiving the Oxford Astrazeneca jab this spring.Jamie spent 124 days in hospital and was lucky to survive his doctors thought he would need to live in a care home for the rest of his life. But, although he is now home with Kate and their boys, the brain injury he still lives with has changed his life.“We feel like the luckiest unlucky people because, despite all of this, Jamie has made more of a recovery than any of the medical teams thought possible,” she says. “But our life is still dramatically impacted. He’s able to communicate with us and to outsiders, he looks like he’s very much almost back to normal. But for our family that’s not the case.”Jamie can no longer work as a software engineer or even care for his children without supervision, for example.“I solely have to be responsible for the boys as he can’t independently look after them at the moment, which is very difficult for him as well,” says Scott. “He’s amazing. His motivation is truly inspiring, and the doctors have used the term miracle. I feel sometimes when I get upset that I’m being ungrateful. I know that others have lost loved ones.”Kate has had to stop working as a customer service coordinator for a children\u0027s charity to look after Jamie and the children full time. They are struggling financially and Kate worries they may have to sell the family home. She points out the £120,000 maximum payment from the VDPS scheme was worth £500,000 or more when the scheme was launched in 1979.“That’s a lot more money and enough to pay off most people’s mortgages. It would mean Jay could just focus on getting better or one day, he could do a vocational job, perhaps, where there was less pressure on him. It would mean that what has already been traumatic for our children doesn’t get worse. That we don’t have to move house because of it.”In the summer, Kate wrote to Boris Johnson to draw his attention to the holes in the Government’s vaccine safety net. Like others, she pointed out that other developed countries have more generous schemes.“You have suffered a heartbreaking and frightening change but I would like to pay tribute to your strength in proposing changes which you think could improve the situation. You’re not a statistic, and must not be ignored. I am deeply touched by your story.”Johnson went on to say he had asked the DHSC to consider the proposed reforms but, to date, there has been no announcement of change and not a single case has yet been settled via the government scheme. Indeed the DHSC has been directing victims like Gareth and Kate into the benefits system.

Everybody has the right to live, work and study in a respectful environment.In an email to students sent on Sunday afternoon, Prof Luckhurst said: I responded to their decision by reminding the students that South College is committed to the defence of free speech. When they did not return to their seats, I called their walkout \u0027pathetic\u0027.My anger reflected my sincere commitment to freedom of speech. However, I was wrong to describe the students\u0027 action as pathetic and I apologise unreservedly for doing so.A Durham University spokesman said: Durham University upholds freedom of speech within the law. As such we welcome ersity of opinions from our students, staff and visitors.Protection of the right to free speech extends to discussion of issues that are controversial, including the expression of views which may shock, disturb, or offend others.More from NewsPrince Harry ‘did not raise concerns’ about billionaire Saudi donor with Clarence HouseOverweight detective who took 76 sick days a year wins payout for discriminationArthur Labinjo-Hughes case prompts pledge to get 100,000 ‘ghost children’ back in schoolGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: British teen \u0026#39was asked did you have fun?\u0026#39 after Epstein massageEric Zemmour is the Trump for the FrenchTory rebellion looms over demand to scrap visa fees for Commonwealth Army veteransMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"football agent senior club manager exposed telegraph investigation","story":"The Football Association has suspended a player agent and a senior club football manager following their conviction for bribery charges.The two men were found guilty of soliciting and accepting bribes at Southwark Crown Court in 2019 in order to gain influence in the selection, management and ownership of players.The charges followed an undercover investigation by The  that raised allegations of serious corruption against the three men.In 2016, undercover reporters recorded conversations between Dax Price, Tommy Wright and Giuseppe Pino Pagliara, who worked at the highest level in the game, which revealed claims that backhanders and illicit payments were commonplace in English football.Responding to the news, Labour MP Kevin Brennan, who is a member of the Parliamentary Culture, Media and Sport select committee congratulated … The Daily  for exposing this scandal.The murky world of football finance and dodgy agents should have long since been cleaned up – I hope these convictions and suspensions will also lead to stronger oversight and regulation of this ugly side of the beautiful game, he said.The  published its Football for Sale investigation in 2016 and over five days revealed allegations of greed and corruption in English football.One of the stories resulted in Sam Allardyce losing his job as England manager after he was exposed for negotiating a £400,000 business deal. He had only overseen one international match by the time the revelations were published and the allegations led to him agreeing to leave his post by mutual consent.Other stories examined accusations of bribery in English football and led to detectives from the City of London Police Economic Crime Directorate launching a criminal investigation.Three men exposed in this newspaper appeared in court and – in December 2019 – Price, 50, was found guilty of two counts of paying and facilitating a bribe. Wright, 55, the former assistant manager of Barnsley FC, was convicted on two counts of accepting a bribe.Price received a suspended 18-month sentence with an unpaid work requirement of 250 hours and a three-month curfew, whilst Wright was given a 12-month suspended sentence and ordered to repay the £5,000 payment that he had accepted as a bribe as well as £3,000 in costs by Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC.Price’s business partner, Pagliara, was also found guilty last year of two counts of paying and facilitating a bribe. The FA said it did not investigate Pagliara because he did not fall under the regulator’s remit.Price was found to have arranged with Pagliara to pay Wright £5,000 in cash, with the promise of another £5,000 to come, in return for encouraging his players to sign with their sports agency, placing their players in the Barnsley first team, arranging a meeting with the owners of the club and supplying confidential information about his players’ contracts.The bribe was paid in cash by an undercover reporter posing as an executive for a fictitious Far East sports conglomerate set up by this newspaper in 2016 as part of a sting operation, following a tip off about corruption in English football.The FA has now sanctioned Wright and Price for two breaches of FA Rule E3, which states that: “A participant shall at all times act in the best interests of the game and shall not act in any manner which is improper or brings the game into disrepute.”Wright has been suspended from all football and football-related activity, except for coaching, for six years and Price has been suspended from all football and football-related activity for nine years.The independent regulatory commission who imposed the sanctions agreed with the judge in the bribery trial when he said that, from the very first meeting with the undercover journalist, Pagliara and Price revealed an awareness of corruption in the football transfer market and a willingness to be involved.Wright told the commission his main motivation was  always the betterment of Barnsley FC and the football league  and his intentions were only to improve Barnsley FC by bringing the best players possible into the club which would not only have strengthened Barnsley FC but also improved the Football League.He added that he became involved with the two agents because he  naïvely believed they had the capabilities to bring such talented footballers to the Championship  and was  deeply ashamed of the conversations and meetings that occurred  when money was discussed.Although he maintained that taking £5,000 from the undercover journalist was nothing sinister he accepted his behaviour was stupid and he was naïve for accepting the money and lying to Barnsley FC about it.Price gave evidence to the commission and made an apology for his “mistakes”. The commission said: “He told the panel he had lost his daughter as a result of his actions and described how the matter had affected him as it had been hanging over him for six years. He said he has suffered for what he described as his ‘horrendous judgment call’.This Commission concluded that the two men’s offending had caused a very serious and lasting detriment to the image of football.It added: There is obviously a need for the sanctions to reflect the severity of the offending, to punish and to deter others from entering into similar enterprises in order to protect the game of football from any similar behaviour in the future and to promote confidence amongst stakeholders and fans of the game.More from NewsPunishing the unvaccinated would be both immoral and unjustifiedPrince Harry ‘did not raise concerns’ about billionaire Saudi donor with Clarence HouseOverweight detective who took 76 sick days a year wins payout for discriminationArthur Labinjo-Hughes case prompts pledge to get 100,000 ‘ghost children’ back in schoolGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: British teen \u0026#39was asked did you have fun?\u0026#39 after Epstein massageEric Zemmour is the Trump for the FrenchMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"generation coke britain got hooked","story":"If, as it has been memorably asserted, the pandemic and its assorted lockdowns has largely seen middle-class people hiding and working-class people bringing them things, then it should hardly be a surprise that the delivery menu has also included illegal drugs. After all, there’s Ocado for groceries, a host of scooter warriors for meals and Amazon for everything else. Why should cocaine be any different?Covid, official figures reveal, hasn’t put a dent in the drugs trade hasn’t stopped those lethal entrepreneurs in the Andes from finding a way to supply the US and Europe, their most profitable markets. Above all, it hasn’t stemmed our prodigious demand for Charlie, the Big C, White Lady, Nose Candy, Flake, or the (misnamed, since the vast majority comes from Colombia and Peru) Bolivian marching powder.In the last eight years, a near 20-year decline in drug use has been abruptly reversed. The ONS, which tracks consumption through surveys, is clear what’s behind it: “changes in powder cocaine use”.Today, 2.6 per cent of British adults admit to using cocaine, an increase of more than 30 per cent since 2013. And while the Government, in revealing its 10-year drugs strategy yesterday, said it would target 300,000 perennial abusers with treatment, it offered much tougher words for casual snorters.“We’re not going to sit idly by while we have lifestyle users using Class A drugs,” said Boris Johnson, proposing tough new measures. Plans include removing passports and driving licences to inconvenience middle-class dope dabblers and, the Government hopes, make them reflect on their part in a chain of misery that may end at a Notting Hill shindig, but can begin with brutality in South and Central America, and continue with vicious county lines turf wars back here. “These people think it’s a victimless crime,” said the PM. “It isn’t. The country is ­littered with victims.”That drugs kill, though, is hardly news. And guilt has not limited consumption among the smart set so far. The very same people who rave about Netflix’s brilliant but ultra-violent series Narcos, which documents the rise of Pablo Escobar, are quite happy to keep hoovering up the Toot, even as coke-war eviscerations play out on screen before them.“When I think about the layers of the cocaine trade and the misery it inflicts on people involved, I do feel ashamed, but clearly not enough,” recounts one newish mother, who gathers with five friends “all pushing 40, for monthly ‘cocaine brunches’.”“I compartmentalise,” she says. “That is the raw truth. It’s a holiday from my life – and for now at least, I have no intention of changing that.”Not least as exchanging booze for powder makes toddler-wrangling easier: “Next morning, there’s no hangover, I’m not exhausted from a late night, but I still feel like I’ve had a blowout.” And she’s not alone. “A large number in my social circle – all middle-class, smart, professional women with children – are at it.”  And that cannot be uncoupled from the end of the civil war in Colombia. From the mid-1960s the country’s government was engaged in what amounted, at times, to civil war with Farc communnist guerillas. But by 2013 hostilities had abated, and by 2016, the two sides signed a historic peace deal, under the terms of which many revolutionaries were meant to be found education and jobs. When those didn’t materialise, many turned to farming coca. “Global cocaine manufacture, which had fallen by 37 per cent over the period 2006–2014, more than doubled over the period 2014–2019, to an estimated 1,784 tonnes,” notes the UN in its most recent report on the global drugs market. “The marked increase,” it adds, “has primarily been the result of changes in Colombia.” No one wants to blame a global glut of drugs on a peace deal. But the truth is, Colombia now accounts for almost two-thirds of the world’s estimated manufacture of cocaine.Expanding supply lines have met that increased production. Once, the Calabrian mafia known as the ‘Ndrangheta, which fostered direct contacts with Latin American suppliers, held a European monopoly. But the post-truce collapse of Farc’s own stranglehold in Colombian production areas led to a “proliferation of smaller criminal and armed non-State groups” seeking partners to traffic their product. Albanian gangs, Bosnian Serbs, Croats, Serbs and Montenegrins in particular, stepped in. Cocaine became a hugely competitive market.As so often with competition, the consumer benefited: prices dropped, quality increased. In fact, purity shot up by almost 40 per cent from 2011 to 2018. Britain, long considered the poor cousin of the US, was flooded with coke every bit as refined as that on the other side of the Atlantic. Then the pandemic arrived and dealers ensured that the regulars were kept supplied. Smug snorters had never had it so good.Indeed, it’s not just the pandemic driving drug-dealing ersification. The so-called “dark web” – an underground internet accessed using special browsers – is home to thriving marketplaces which are capturing ever-larger parts of the trade at least £237 million in annual sales in 2017, a four-fold increase in six years. Such direct-to-consumer supplies avoid the hassles of illicit dealers – they are simply posted in the mail.But that still doesn’t answer the question of demand, of why 6 per cent of our increasingly puritanical, drink-less, vegan, 16-24-year-olds have tried it, for example, even as they shun other stimulants, notably alcohol.“I’ve got a 22-year-old and an 18-year-old, and I see it all the time among their friends,” says one mother. “It’s definitely normalised. For them it’s like going to the pub, but cheaper. When we were younger, coke was a yuppie drug, or a hard drug. They view coke very differently. They don’t see it as a Class A drug at all.“They really don’t connect the dots,” between consumption and wider drugs violence, she adds. “But then, most middle class people don’t. I know lots of people who still take it at 50. Sure, they feel bad in the morning, but not as bad as you do with alcohol.” As is backed up by the experience of the “cocaine brunch” set.Across all ages, it seems, cocaine is no longer demonised. Universities will be targeted by the new strategy. Offices may be encouraged to follow. But with coke so widespread, it’s hard to preach without being accused of hypocrisy. One workplace already in the firing line is the Palace of Westminster, whose loos are reportedly plastered with traces of cocaine use, prompting Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to warn that he would be contacting the police “as a priority”. Both the PM and Michael Gove have admitted taking cocaine in their youth.Loewenstein says it is time to admit that half a century of war-on-drugs announcements like yesterday’s are not working, and simply provide political cover for policy failure. “Demand has never been higher, the cost has never been cheaper, access has never been easier. The stats are clear. Drugs are a normal part of many people’s lives.”After he rings off, I try to find more details of the Government’s new plan. As if to prove his point, I am halfway through reading its policy document, setting out its priorities to intervene with young people, treat the most addicted, and stifle gangs supplying drugs. Then I realise I am reading the wrong 10-year plan. This one, near identical in many ways, dates from 1998.  More from NewsPunishing the unvaccinated would be both immoral and unjustifiedPrince Harry ‘did not raise concerns’ about billionaire Saudi donor with Clarence HouseOverweight detective who took 76 sick days a year wins payout for discriminationArthur Labinjo-Hughes case prompts pledge to get 100,000 ‘ghost children’ back in schoolGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: British teen \u0026#39was asked did you have fun?\u0026#39 after Epstein massageEric Zemmour is the Trump for the FrenchMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government right judges have become powerful","story":"This could have set the stage for an almighty battle between the elected representatives of the people and the judiciary. Instead, Jefferson, the serving president, acquiesced. The court got its way and has ever since had the right to strike down laws agreed by members of the House of Representatives and the Senate.In Britain we have, thankfully, avoided such a situation, largely thanks to the establishment’s resistance to regular demands for a written or codified constitution. But that hasn’t prevented senior judges from over-ruling certain ministerial decisions down the years when their lordships have decided that this or that policy is outwith the explicit remit of the relevant Act of Parliament.Few could oppose such a system. If a minister is acting ultra vires, then he or she is acting against the will of parliament as expressed in legislation, and if a senior judge won’t point this out, who will?Still, there are suspicions that many of the judges making politically embarrassing judgments are themselves adhering to their own political views in the way they are interpreting the law. Which is why there have been reports of government plans to introduce an annual “Interpretation Bill” which would strike down court rulings with which ministers disagree.One of the most consistent arguments used by Left wing campaigners in favour of a Remain vote in the 2016 EU referendum – and it is the same argument that recruited a previously sceptical Labour movement into the EU’s camp in the late 1980s – was that, since British electors kept electing right wing government, we should rely on activist judges in Brussels to impose the “right” kind of social policies on Britain against the will of voters and the government. Whether it was the length of the working week or environmental standards, the European Court of Justice and the European Commission knew far better than the elected government or the silly, reactionary people who voted for them, what was good for us.More from NewsPrince Harry ‘did not raise concerns’ about billionaire Saudi donor with Clarence HouseOverweight detective who took 76 sick days a year wins payout for discriminationArthur Labinjo-Hughes case prompts pledge to get 100,000 ‘ghost children’ back in schoolGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: British teen \u0026#39was asked did you have fun?\u0026#39 after Epstein massageEric Zemmour is the Trump for the FrenchTory rebellion looms over demand to scrap visa fees for Commonwealth Army veteransMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inedible food tears 20 minute daily walks around car park","story":"Cold food, tearful guests and exercise consisting of a 20-minute daily walk around a bleak car park isn\u0027t what most people would associate with a hotel stay. But this is the quarantine reality for people returning to the UK from South Africa. One such couple serving time at one of the government-approved hotels are Kate and Alex Freed.After getting married in September, they booked their post-nuptial trip to South Africa. But the honeymoon period is well and truly over, and they are now stuck in an awful hotel overlooking Heathrow serving inedible food.Perhaps the most grim condition is that they have to request to be allowed go for a walk outside. A security guard accompanies them downstairs, and they are allowed 20 minutes in the hotel car park before being told they have to go back inside, the pair say.Speaking on the third day of their 10-day quarantine period, Mrs Freed, 29, said: We’d been planning the South Africa trip for ages … we didn’t book it until the green list changed and the foreign travel advice was that it was safe to go to.Her 30-year-old husband added: To be charged for coming back to your country when the Government’s told you it’s safe to go, I think is just wrong.The couple flew back from South Africa on Dec 2, after having their original flight home cancelled due to the travel ban.It was the trip they\u0027d dreamed of, having been forced to rearrange their wedding day four times due to Covid.They said it took almost six hours to get from the plane at Heathrow to their hotel - the Holiday Inn Express at the airport\u0027s Terminal 4 - including waiting in a bus to be taken to their rooms.They put us on to a bus for the 30-second journey, but we were on the bus for three hours, Mr Freed explained.We were on a bus full of people, (with) no ventilation. It was the most unorganised mess ever. People were crying. It just seemed like something from a film, it was a bit mad, he added.After arriving at the hotel itself, the pair said they had food and other supplies delivered by their family, because the hotel food was inedible.You’re paying serious money and … it’s not substantial meals. Half the time it’s cold, half the time it’s just inedible, Mr Freed said.Travellers returning from red list countries originally faced a cost of £1,750 to quarantine in a hotel when the scheme was first announced in February. The price has now risen to £2,285 for the 11-night stay.I’d rather pay for security outside my flat and they can watch me not leave,” Mrs Freed said.I don’t disagree with quarantine if that’s what the Government want to do… It’s just the cost that’s come with it, she added.The way it is run is awful. I just feel something needs to be done about it, Mr Freed said.The Holiday Inn Express declined to comment, but the Department of Health and Social Care spokesman told The : The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme.The majority of passengers who have used the Managed Quarantine Service have been satisfied with the service. All complaints are treated seriously and are investigated fully.Francesca Desquesnes was on holiday in South Africa, preparing for a safari, when the news came through from her sister that she needed to get home now. After trying and failing to book several flights home, she finally arrived at her accommodation for the next 10 days on Dec 2. It\u0027s inhumane. I would I would actually ask any MP to come and spend 10 days in the hotel like this and do what we do and then tell us it\u0027s humane.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Grant Shapps - all three of you.Ms Desquesnes\u0027s will be allowed to leave at one minute past midnight on Dec 15, but has to endure another nine days yet. She told The : I think if you\u0027re not a person that is a strong person, and you weren\u0027t mentally strong, this would destroy you. I honestly believe that this would destroy most people\u0027s sanity.This is not humane or a nice way to treat British citizens. It makes me not want to be British.She - and others in the hotel - have taken their daily exercise into their own hands and started to defy the security protocols. You have to request permission to exercise. You contact security or reception but they don\u0027t answer. Sunday I went out for an hour and it\u0027s like One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest. And then today, I tried doing it, and they didn\u0027t answer. So I just looked out of my room and said I\u0027m going for a walk. And that\u0027s what a lot of people are having to do. We\u0027re just defying them.I think people are wearing masks and we\u0027re following the rules. But if we want to go out for exercise, then people walk.Ms Desquesnes said the food she\u0027s been served is worse than she ate at a HIV project in Africa where she lived with 30 people in a four-bed house. It feels like a prison, she said. It really does. It feels like I\u0027m in Guantanamo Bay. I will never go to prison if this is what it\u0027s like.Michelle Bovey-Wood is trapped at the Holiday Inn Gatwick - the same hotel lambasted by Richard E Grant - with her wife Sharon and their six-year-old daughter Leah. They landed on Dec 2 to find a room that sleeps two people, having paid more than £7,000 for one that sleeps three. Mrs Bovey-Wood was told that the sofa doubled as a bed, even though there was no sheet, pillows or duvet. They had to construct their own bed out of the cushions for their daughter. She told The : Quite honestly, as far as hotel experience goes, I\u0027ve had better in a non-graded hotel in the third world. It\u0027s total abuse. It has abused basically every single human right that we have - freedom of movement - in every sense. People are rude, it\u0027s isolating, there is no support should you need it. It\u0027s horrific.Mrs Bovey-Wood was told that because they had a child, the hotel would accommodate more exercise time - three half-hour slots a day. But they are being allowed out once a day - on Sunday for seven minutes and Monday for 10 minutes. Their exercise space is the hotel\u0027s courtyard - a strip of walkway around a patch of grass. The view is the rooms they are confined to for the other 23 hours and 50 minutes a day. And the hotel tries to send them out alone to avoid mixing with other quarantining families.Mrs Bovey-Wood explained: We were told initially that we could have two to three times a day, as is necessary with a child, and it would be up to half an hour at a time.If you request it, then you wait for about half an hour. If you\u0027re lucky. Somebody will come get you. They usher you down the passage. It was seven minutes. And then there\u0027s a hurry upstairs again. And they said, \u0027No, no, no, it\u0027s going to get better\u0027, the next day we were informed - 10 minutes.And that\u0027s it once a day.  The food served is hot if you\u0027re lucky, and Monday morning\u0027s breakfast consisted of a dry crumpet with a bit of bacon, bread with margarine, three blueberries and a black banana. Lunch is a sandwich, a packet of crisps and a stale chocolate bar. Mrs Bovey-Wood said: You get better care in prisons. I think when we got the bread and margarine this morning, and they inform you of 10 minutes of exercise - which I believe your basic human rights in a prison is at least half an hour\u0027s exercise a day - then you know that there\u0027s a huge problem here.They are given one cold drink a day, but Sharon is a diabetic. Sunday\u0027s drink given to them in the evening was Coke, which Mrs Bovey-Wood explained wasn\u0027t the ideal choice for a six-year-old at night. The mood in the hotel is tense, and the family can hear complaints through the walls. I can hear from our rooms - we can hear everything - there\u0027s a lot of complaining. Of course we have no Wi-Fi either, so we can\u0027t work right now. And smokers aren\u0027t actually allowed to go and use their time for smoking - they have to keep moving.What are they doing to keep sane within the confines of their room? The little one is doing drawing and she\u0027s getting some screen time.The Bovey-Woods are emigrating to the UK from South Africa, and they have not yet been told when they will be free to leave.It has not been the dream start ot their life in the UK. Incredibly rude staff, she said. We got shoved in a room that wasn\u0027t prepared for three people. So you asked for duvets and incredibly rude staff say you have to make up your own beds, that kind of stuff. It\u0027s just grown progressively worse because it\u0027s very clear that they don\u0027t have enough staff to deal with everything.Lauren Hopkins, a recruitment agency boss, says she faces another 11 days stranded in South Africa because there is no quarantine hotel room available until Dec 13 in the UK. She arrived in South Africa on Nov 21 for a 10 day holiday but fears she will not be back in her home until just before Christmas Day.I run a small independent recruitment agency and having worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep it going, I was in desperate need of a break. In reality, this experience has been anything but relaxing and stress free. In all honesty I am ashamed to be British. I, and hundreds of other British citizens have been completely abandoned by our own Government. To say I feel let down is a gross understatement. It\u0027s an utter disgrace.Flights aren\u0027t an issue, it\u0027s getting a hotel quarantine booking that\u0027s keeping us all here. They haven\u0027t put nearly enough on for the amount of us. We\u0027ve been trying since Sunday November 28th to get a booking with no luck. At the moment the 13th December is the earliest availability, meaning we come out Christmas Day and have to fund an extra 11 nights in South Africa. From the communication of the quarantine decision to the lack of any help or cooperation from the Embassy officials to the cancellation of flights homeward, to the severe shortage of quarantine hotels, the acts of our Government have been shocking in their ineptitude.I will never again place faith in politicians or in Departments of State.Richard E Grant has said he was left “confounded” after being stuck in a quarantine hotel charging more than twice as much as a similar alternative nearby.The Withnail and I actor said he had been visiting his 90-year-old mother in southern Africa when he was caught out by the change in travel restrictions.Speaking in a video on Twitter, Grant said: “I went to southern Africa to visit my 90-year-old mother and got caught by the red region Covid restrictions.“It took over a week and many cancelled flights to finally get home, for which I am incredibly grateful.“I understand that there are security costs in the hotel and you’ve got to pay for two Covid tests, but £228 a day to receive 3 meals a day of this very poor standard, in a supposed 4* Holiday Inn hotel, beggars belief.”Grant said his meals, which included a pre-packaged tuna and cucumber sandwich, a sausage casserole and fish and chips, would cost less than £20 to buy elsewhere.A nearby Holiday Inn not being used as a quarantine hotel costs just £89 per night, including breakfast – more than half the cost incurred by red list travellers.More from NewsPunishing the unvaccinated would be both immoral and unjustifiedPrince Harry ‘did not raise concerns’ about billionaire Saudi donor with Clarence HouseOverweight detective who took 76 sick days a year wins payout for discriminationArthur Labinjo-Hughes case prompts pledge to get 100,000 ‘ghost children’ back in schoolGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: British teen \u0026#39was asked did you have fun?\u0026#39 after Epstein massageEric Zemmour is the Trump for the FrenchMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch kamala harris became incredible disappearing vice president","story":"Kamala Harris made history as the first woman, first Black American and first Asian-American to become vice president. But after less than a year in the post, she is a historically unpopular vice president, according to The \u0027s Washington Editor Rozina Sabur. As seen in the video above, where Ms Harris was once always in the frame during Joe Biden\u0027s major addresses, she\u0027s been notably absent from the president\u0027s side of late. “For now at least, it seems she is no longer Joe Biden\u0027s heir apparent,” says Rozina Sabur.“A number of Democrats seem prepared to challenge her for the nomination should Biden not seek re-election in 2024.”More from NewsPunishing the unvaccinated would be both immoral and unjustifiedPrince Harry ‘did not raise concerns’ about billionaire Saudi donor with Clarence HouseOverweight detective who took 76 sick days a year wins payout for discriminationArthur Labinjo-Hughes case prompts pledge to get 100,000 ‘ghost children’ back in schoolGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: British teen \u0026#39was asked did you have fun?\u0026#39 after Epstein massageEric Zemmour is the Trump for the FrenchMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab admits no10 staff","story":"Dominic Raab admits a No staff party last Christmas would have breached Covid rulesBoris Johnson has insisted no rules were broken - but the Deputy Prime Minister said  there was a formal party held, of course that is something that is clearly contrary to the guidanceDominic Raab did not deny the allegations but said they were unsubstantiated Image: PAByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | comments Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab today admitted a Downing Street staff party in the run-up to last Christmas would have been a clear breach of coronavirus rules.Boris Johnson has not denied the Mirror’s revelations that members of No’s team staged a bash on December  when London was under Tier  restrictions.But the PM has insisted no rules were broken.

The words yesterday from Cambridge University statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter rang alarm bells about the potential impact of Christmas socialising. Continued contradictory messages from a rule-breaking Prime Minister on both parties and socialising is heightening concern as the coronavirus spreads, including an Omicron iant worrying virologists. And when vaccines are the main line of Britain’s defence in this pandemic, Boris Johnson’s failure to mobilise a national jabbing programme to match the huge effort earlier this year is a lethal and expensive blunder.

Yet children continue to die after facing the most horric and unthinkable cruelty.

Boris Johnson has been under sustained pressure after the Mirror revealed allegations that boozy parties were held in Downing Street in the run-up to Christmas last year.The PM gave a speech at a packed leaving do in November, during the second national lockdown, sources told the Mirror. And revellers at an unofficial No Christmas bash on December  allegedly enjoyed food, drinks and games which went on well past midnight. Millions of people were living under strict Covid rules at the time - with London under Tier  restrictions. The following day Mr Johnson announced that Christmas plans had to be drastically scaled back.No  is under growing pressure to explain what happened last year and the Met Police has been asked to consider whether Covid restrictions were broken by two Labour MPs. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman declined to say whether an internal investigation had been carried out. There was not a party, and Covid rules have been followed at all times, he said. No has refused to answer questions about the alleged events but repeatedly insisted no rules have been broken. The spokesman added that Downing Street was still considering holding a staff party this year despite Mr Raab ruling out one for the Ministry of Justice. The spokesman said: We havenapost confirmed any dates at the moment. I think there is an intention to have a Christmas party this year. There is nothing in the limited restrictions that weaposve introduced that would prevent Christmas parties from taking place. Home Office Minister Kit Malthouse said he had been assured that no rules had been broken - but also that he knew nothing about it. He told Sky News: I know nothing about it - Iaposve been assured by No  that no rules were brokenthere was a gathering of any kind. No  are reassuring everybody that all rules were complied with during that period and I take that reassurance at face value, but no doubtthe police are alerted they will have a look and they will form a view and weaposll learn more about it in the days to come. The police should be investigating anything that is a historic crime to them. Meanwhile, ministers have sowed confusion by giving conflicting statements about Covid guidance for the festive period. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that people should not cancel their Christmas plans, and nativity plays and festive bashes should go ahead.But some schools and businesses have cancelled their plans due to fears over the Omicron iant.Speaking on a visit to Liverpool as he set out his new drugs policy, he denied the UK has been too slow to respond to Omicron.I donapost think we need to change the overall guidance and advice weaposre giving about Omicron in this country, he said. Weaposre still waiting to see exactly how dangerous it is, what sort of effect it has in terms of deaths and hospitalisations. Askedhe could say for certain there wouldnapost be social restrictions before Christmas, the PM says Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas - with the possible exception for the county lines drugs gangs.

The intended insult comes amid high tension between the West and Russia, and follows the Tory minister’s blunt warning to the Kremlin against making a “strategic mistake by invading Ukraine. Moscow reacted to her “provocative” images atop a British army Challenger  tank close to the Russian border in Estonia. One broadcaster even appeared to question her sanity with an offensive slur mentioning her mental health.  Footage from state-controlled Channel  shows presenter Anatoly Kuzichev informing his viewers: There is a new Iron Lady in British politics. UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss had a ride on a tank in Estonia. During joint drills in the Baltics, Truss claimed she wants a world where democracies prosper - not just survive. Apparently a tank ride, even , promotes prosperity. The broadcast used avideo showing Truss but overlaid it with the music Entry of the Gladiators by the Czech composer Julius Fucik, a melody associated with circuses - to introduce the clowns.The attack came on TV talk show Vremya Pokazhet -translated into English as Time Will Tell . In , hardline Soviet newspaper Red Star branded Tory leader Margaret Thatcher the “Iron Lady” but the author military journalist Yuri Gavrilov later admitted his planned biting insult had spectacularly backfired. A week after the publication, Thatcher told a constituency event: ”I stand before you tonight in my Red Star evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the Iron Lady of the Western world. She was delighted, she said,the tag Iron Lady was how the Soviets wish to interpret my defence of values and freedoms fundamental to our way of le”.Three years later she swept to power in her historic  General Election victory, making her the UKaposs first female Prime Minister.Diehard communist Gavrilov’s aim had been to “cut her down to size”, he said after his retirement, but the opposite happened.I thought - aposKnight in Skirts but it sounded too clumsy, he said. Racking his brains, the Iron Chancellor - Germanyaposs Otto von Bismarck - came to mind. Finally, I thought of aposIron Ladyapos - and the rest is history. I hit the nail right on its head, didnapost I ”Kuzichev suggested the images of Truss on a tank were an upgrade on Boris Johnson at the Peppa Pig “fun fair”.Another presenter on the show Artyom Sheynin ed to the tank theme in describing the Truss trip to Estonia. Things got a bit too much for the British foreign secretary, who said aposleave me aloneapos, jumped into a tank and started driving towards the Russian border,” he said.  Of course, she was stopped by the Estonians, barely after  metres. You know, who knows what she might have done ” His rant went on: ”I can understand that her nerves are giving way. She probably doesnapost know herself whataposs going on. “First, thereaposs war, then there isnapost, first [the Russians] are massing forces, then theyaposre not. Nothing is clear. And this is the same girl who was concerned about stability on the European continent. Official Kremlin daily newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta also mocked the Foreign Secretary’s tank ride. The Englishwoman was unable to come up with anything better than to ride around in the Baltics - in the immediate vicinity of Russia’s border - in a British Challenger  tank and make new threats against Moscow, it stated. The Moscow reaction seems to show Ms Truss cutting through with the Russians. She had warned Putin over Ukraine: “We have seen this playbook from the Kremlin before when Russia ly claimed its illegal annexation of Crimea was a response to Nato aggression. “Nato is an alliance forged on the principle of defence, not provocation. Any suggestion that Nato is provoking the Russians is clearly . “Any action by Russia to undermine the freedom and democracy that our partners enjoy would be a strategic mistake.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLiz TrussPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But during their trip, the rules changed in the UK and the couple were told they would have to undergo a -day quarantine period on their . The couple, who are currently on their third day of quarantine, have branded their whole experience aposawfulapos. Kate told PA: Weaposd been planning the South Africa trip for ages... we didnapost book it until the green list changed and the foreign travel advice was that it was safe to go to. To be charged for coming back to your country when the Governmentaposs told you itaposs safe to go, I think is just wrong, Alex added. The couple flew back from South Africa on December , after having their original flight home cancelled due to the travel ban. They said it took almost six hours to get from the plane at Heathrow to their hotel, the Holiday Inn Express at Heathrow Terminal , including waiting in a bus from the terminal to the hotel. They put us onto a bus for the -second journey, but we were on the bus for three hours, Alex explained. We were on a bus full of people,no ventilation. It was the most unorganised mess ever. People were crying. It just seemed like something from a film, it was a bit mad, he added. After arriving at the hotel itself, the pair said they had food and other supplies delivered by their family, because the hotel food is inedible. Youaposre paying serious money and... itaposs not substantial meals. Half the time itaposs cold, half the time itaposs just inedible, Alex said. Day to day, guests can request to go outside for a walk. A security guard accompanies them downstairs, and they are allowed  minutes in the hotel car park before being told they have to go back inside, the pair said. Travellers ing from red list countries originally faced a cost of £, to quarantine in a hotel when the scheme was first announced in February.  The price has now risen to £, for the -night stay. Iaposd rather pay for security outside my flat and they can watch me not leave, Kate said. I donapost disagree with quarantinethataposs what the Government want to do... Itaposs just the cost thataposs come with it, she added. The way it is run is awful. I just feel something needs to be done about it, Alex said.

Brit drivers will be aware of the dangers of falling foul of UK motoring laws - which can lead to hefty fines, and license points. The rules include tougher enforcement for smart motorway drivers and modications to number plates. Below are the five changes to follow to keep your license clean and stay safe on the roads, the Liverpool Echo reports.Stricter rules on smart motorways Rules on the controversial smart motorway are tightening for . The controversy centres around the use of the hard shoulder as a running lane.By using it in this way, it blocks a dedicated space for drivers to pull over in the event of an emergency, Confused explains. In response Highways England announced a modication of the Highway Code, which will make it illegal to drive any lane marked with a red X. That symbol is meant to noty motorists not to drive along the hard shoulder because a vehicle has broken down. UK number plate change Brit drivers in Europe will have to remove the GB sticker stuck to their number plate. The law, which was implemented on September , means stickers and magnets with the letters are no longer valid. They will need to be replaced with a sticker with UK on it.  Drivers with GB on their actual number plate will need to order a new one, or to add a UK sticker. After Britainaposs exit from the EU, drivers in the blocaposs countries must carry a physical green card and their license at all times. Green cards can be ordered from insurers. Stricter penalties for using a phone while behind the wheel Texting or making a phone call while driving is already illegal apart from in emergency situations. The Government is tightening the laws, making the use of a hand-held mobile phone illegal under virtually any circumstances. The penalty for breaking the law is a £ fixed fine and six points on their license. Hands-free devices like sat-nav are not included, and drivers may continue using them as long as theyaposre secured in a cradle. But police can charged themtheyaposre found to not be in proper control fo their vehicle. A fine of £ and six points on the license is the same penalty for breaking this law. Speed limiters In the new year, it will be compulsory for all new cars to have speed limiters fitted. The Intelligent Speed Assistance systemuses video or GPS to detect speed signs, and alert the driverthey’re driving above the speed limit. If the driver doesn’t slow down, the technology will take over and do it for you. Green licence plates Green number plates are now legal in the UK for zero-emissions cars. As they are easily identied, local authorities can offer incentives to zero-emissions drivers, including cheaper parking.

The mum-of-five, from North Wales, underwent tests and MRI scans to try and find the cause of her symptomsLeah Smith before her diagnosis Image: Family handoutByLaura SharmanFreelance writerCharlotte Hadfield:,  Dec | commentsA mother has been stuck in bed for five years after suffering stroke-like symptoms completely out of the blue. Leah Smith, , has to lie flat and often experiences seizures and numbness around her body. The mum-of-five, from North Wales, underwent tests and MRI scans to try and find the cause of her symptoms after her first episode in . Mum Debbie, , was sat next to Leah when she first took a turn for the worse.It was like an altered consciousness, I could see she wasnapost herself, she told the Echo.She looked a bit vacant, she was able to speak but I would see she wasnapost completely with us so I rang an ambulance. In the weeks that followed, Leah began feeling numbness in her legs and underwent a lumbar puncture to check for multiple sclerosis .  Doctors later discovered that the lumbar puncture had caused a Cerebrospinal fluid leakDespite having procedures to try and fix it, which gave Leah temporary pain relief and allowed her to sit up for an hour at a time, they ultimately proved unsuccessful. She has since been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes- a group of rare inherited conditions that affect connective tissue - and Arachnoiditis. The pain disorder is caused by inflammation of the membranes that surround and protect the nerves of the spinal cord, which leads to chronic pain and neurological problems. In the last five years, Leah has only left her home to attend hospital appointments and this is done with extreme dficulty and the help of a lie down wheelchair. Debbie said: Sheaposs got a lie down wheelchair that she canapost even use at the moment because sheaposs in that much pain everywhere, sowe can get rid of some of the pain and she can get back in that wheelchair, sheaposll get stronger. Her muscles and everything are deteriorating, Debbie said.  The deterioration of her in the last  months is exponential. Sheaposs getting weaker and weaker and in more pain. Since her diagnosis, Leahaposs family have been fighting to get her the help she needs but they fear time is running out. She needs multiple lesaving operations which Debbie said are only available through private healthcare. However, specialist doctors in Germany and England may be able to help her. In the meantime, she has round the clock care including from carers, specialised doctors and hospital procedures. A Gofundme page has been set up with the aim of raising enough money for the operations and specialist transport for Leah. Debbie said: Itaposs devastating that you feel that youaposre in this condition and youaposve had to fight to the extent weaposve had to fight to find out the reasons of whataposs going on. And to try and fight to get help to find out the help is only available with specialists you have to pay for.

From Covid tests to isolating, heres what you need to know before your holidayChanges to travel rules will soon be in place in a bid to stop the spread of the Omicron iant Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Dec | comments New changes to UK travel rules are coming into effect due to concerns over the coronavirus. Concerns have been raised over the new Omicron iant, which is beginning to sp rapidly among people in the UK. It has not yet been confirmedthe virus is more easily transmitted,symptoms are more severe orit is more resistant to vaccines, but prime minister Boris Johnson and health secretary Sajid Javid deemed the risk to be unacceptable based on scientic advice that mass transmissions could overwhelm the NHS.It caused the government to reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport as well as other outlets and now travel rule changes are being put in place too. So what are the new rules  Do I need a PCR test to travel   You need to take a PCR test or a lateral flow test when travelling back to the UK and then a PCR test upon arrival.These tests need to be purchased from a government-approved retailer, which you can find on the government website. They will make your holiday pricier, and you will need to isolate at home for two days, or until your PCR test results come back as negative. If you have a positive test, the NHS website states you must self-isolate: The self-isolation period includes the day your symptoms startedand the next  full days.The rules come into effect at am on Tuesday, December , and require that everyone over the age of  take a pre-departure test a maximum of  hours before leaving. Each country has its own set of rules for travel and you should not make the mistake of assuming the UKaposs rules apply abroad.  You should check the requirements for the country youaposre travelling to before booking this test, which you can check on the government website here. France, for example, requires people to show proof of a negative Covid- test resultbefore departure. This applies to all travellers whether they are fully vaccinated or not. How long does a PCR test take to come back   PCR tests are required upon arrival into the UK and you must isolate until receiving a negative result. According to the NHS: Most people get their result the next day, but it may take up to three days. If you do not receive any word of your result by day six, you should call , where lines are open from am until pm.  It is unlikely that a PCR test will take this long to come back, however. You will usually receive word of your test result through either a text message or via email. Some people can also view their test result through the NHS COVID- app. How much do PCR tests cost  The price of a PCR test ies by a large amount. Some, according to the government website, can be bought for as little as £, while others may set you back by as much as £.Some airlines offer discounts on tests and the government PCR tests do not have this option, so check before booking one provided by the authorities.  Travel companies are worried that passengers will be put off by the extra costs of travelling to a particular country. The industry was hit particularly hard by the pandemic.British Airways CEO Sean Doyle said to the BBC : Our customers will now be faced with uncertainty and chaos and yet again this a devastating blow for everyone who works in the travel industry.What are the UKaposs new travel rules   The government has now said that travellers heading into the UK will need to take a Covid test before their departure to try and limit the spread of the virus upon peopleaposs arrival into the country. This can be either a lateral flow or PCR test.  Travel from so-called aposred listapos countries where Covid rates are high require people to isolate for  days. Nigeria is the most recent addition to this list. Rules dfer for fully vaccinated people and the non-vaccinated. Travel rules for the fully vaccinated When you have arrived in the UK, you must take a PCR test before your second day in the country and isolate until receiving a negative result.You also need to complete a passenger locator form, which must be shown as you check in to travel on any form of transport to the UK from abroad. Government guidance says: You’ll need to show your form when you check in to travel or board your plane, train or ferry to the UK. You can submit the form any time in the  hours before you arrive in the UK. Travel rules for the non-vaccinated If you have not been vaccinated or are not fully vaccinated and you are travelling to the UK, then you will need to abide by the following rules:take a Covid- test – to be taken in the  days before you travel to England book and pay for day  and day  Covid- PCR tests – to be taken after arrival in England complete a passenger locator form – to be completed in the  hours before you arrive in EnglandRead MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonCoronavirusSajid Javid MPOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sadly she ran when the house owners saw her but a camera was set up there in case she ed. A camera was also set up in Macclesfield Crematorium, where Rhubarb had been seen, but she never appeared. On the Saturday , there were three sightings in Ash Grove play area and the drone pilot also spotted her at times throughout the day. A trap was set up along with three live cameras and a barbecue to put a scent in the air but these were interfered with by local teens. Nick said: Just after pm, the cameras at the trap went off and guess what ! Two local teens thought it would be a great idea to interfere with the trap and cameras, and slam the door shut.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Luckily Lois Clapcottand her mum were close by and were able to reset the trap in the hope Rhubarb wasnapost nearby watching and scared off by the noise. Two hours later, cameras went off again all around the trap and hey presto, another group of teens interfering with the trap, this time with a lovely aposyoung ladyapos actually trying to climb in the trap. This final act would have ruined any chance of Rhubarb going in with that much activity in the area. The trap was dismantled and removed from the area with the opportunity gone. There were further sightings of Rhubarb in Clough Brook on Sunday, and on Monday she was seen in a park in Marple, near Stockport. Tim Clapcott, Rhubarbaposs owner, drove to Marple and aposhalf a dozen peopleapos who had been following the search on social media were monitoring her from a safe distance. Nick said: A local man called Carl had been sat for a while in the park with his dogs and Rhubarb had slowed down her frantic pace at last and was showing interest before she did what she does best, and ran. Tim went into the woods, sat down and waited. Nothing happened, no sign of her. Then he rang his daughter with an update, almost saying that Rhubarb was nowhere to be seen. It was wet, freezing cold and he was about to give up when Rhubarb appeared, picked up her dadaposs scent, heard his voice and ran straight to him for a huge warm cuddle, safe at last. He added: She is absolutely exhausted and hungry and thirsty as expected, but other than that, completely unharmed and has managed to keep herself safe It has been an absolute pleasure working with the family, Debs, Tim and Lois who have all been out in freezing temperatures, rain, storms and their efforts have been relentless day and night. The local communities in Macclesfield, Bollington, Marple and all interconnecting towns and villages have all been amazing, phoning sightings in and assisting with searches, all hoping for a safe outcome. Thank you all for helping, keeping a look out and sending your best wishes for Rhubarb.

Paige Bliss, , spent five days in intensive care but her condition worsened and she was told she could die as her daughter Miley was taking all her nutrients and extra oxygen. The beautician, from Birmingham, West Midlands, underwent an emergency C-section in August but was unable to meet her newborn until she recovered from the highly infectious virus. After spending nine weeks in the newborn intensive care unit , -week-old Miley is set to celebrate her first Christmas at home. Paige said: “I have no idea how I caught the virus but I suddenly had a runny nose and flu-like symptoms. “After five days, I was breathless so I rang  who called me an ambulance. My oxygen was low and I began to get worse.  “Within two days, I was in intensive care and the doctors began to question what to do with the baby. Paige was given a c-pap mask but her condition did not improve.Doctors saidshe did not deliver her baby, she could die as she was not able to take any medication due to her pregnancy.I was reluctant at first and more worried about my unborn baby than myself but I had no choice, she said. Paige agreed to an emergency C-section after five days in ICU and her daughter was born on August  weighing the same as a carton of milk at lb oz.  She added: “I was so scared in case something bad happened to her. “I was put to sleep for the C-section so I didn’t even see her nor meet her for a whole week after. I was put on a ventilator straight after her birth then I had to wait until I recovered from the virus. “It was the worst thing ever.” Her partner Mason Taylor, , was at Miley’s side who was in and out of critical care.  He printed off pictures for the first time mum but she admitted fearing they may not bond. “I was worried in case I wouldn’t be able to bond with her but thankfully we bonded straight away, Paige said. “My heart was so full from the moment I held her. She was so poorly and there were machines everywhere.” Miley was on a ventilator from birth as she had sticky lungs. She underwent two blood transfusions during her nine-week stay at Heartlands and Good Hope hospital in Birmingham.  Paige said: “I feel lucky that Miley and I are both alive. She frightened us a few times as she was so small and fragile. “She had some breathing problems but she was determined to get better.” Miley’s due date was November  and she was the same size as a coke bottle when she was born. “She is still tiny and weighs lb oz but she is doing fine, she added. “She wears tiny baby clothes and there is a chance she may develop a little slower, but she is here and that is all that matters. “Mason and I are so excited for our first Christmas as a three.  After the traumatic experience, Paige praised the aposamazingapos staff at the hospitals for their care. She said: The ICU staff and all the neonatal staff are incredible Miley wouldn’t be here without them. I think everyone should research the vaccine fully themselves and make their own decisions. But I do encourage pregnant women to be more careful and shield as much as possible.

She died just six weeks after receiving a terminal cancer diagnosisLisa Harrison, , from Willington, lost her mother to an aggressive brain tumour in November this year Image: Lisa HarrisonByFaith PringLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Dec A mum who thought her medication was making her unwell died just six weeks after receiving a terminal cancer diagnosis. Marion Greenwood, , was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in September after complaining of dizziness and feeling generally unwell.Her daughter Lisa Harrison, , from Willington in Derbyshire, said the family thought her dizzy spells were due to her medication, DerbyshireLive reports.Lisa said: “You know, we thought it was down to high blood pressure tablets, you don’t think when you feel dizzy that it’s a brain tumour, so it’s just a matter of going through the motions with it.“Things started to happen quite quickly with the small droop of the mouth and then we thought she’d had a stroke.  Then it wasn’t until she went into the hospital, you know my dad rang for  after the paramedics had been there the night before and then a scan showed a mass on the brain. “Every week we lost some more of mum, it went from there to losing one side of her mobility, so every weekend there was something dferent that had happened.” On September , Marion was referred to the neurology unit at Queen’s Medical Centrein Nottingham and had another MRI scan. She underwent a biopsy a few days later but by then, Marion was unable to move on her own and she lost her peripheral vision. On October , she received the results of a biopsy which showed she had a grade  glioblastoma multorme . Marion passed away on November , peacefully at home. Her daughter said she would be greatly missed by their entire family, particularly for her brother Jason, , who was suffering from Covid- while his mother was in hospital. He was prevented from seeing her while she was able to communicate properly, Lisa said.  She said: “My brother had Covid while she was in hospital so he couldn’t go and see her which was really hard because he wanted to see her obviously. We knew time was ticking on, but he never really got to see her when she was actually in a better state of mind and being able to talk and stuff. “He managed to see her towards the end of her losing her speech, which was a bit upsetting really, and that he didn’t get to spend those vital days with her because he got Covid. “But every day was a special day, you know. We had to take it all as it came and be thankful for that day, that we had her for another day extra.” Lisa has now turned her attention to fundraising for brain tumour research. She claims that only one percent of funds for cancer research are targeted at finding a cure for brain tumours. She said: “ is going to be a very busy year. “We need to get the awareness out there to help others because it needs to be brought to the forefront and to help other people. “It’s not just the elderly that get brain tumours, it’s little children, it can happen to everybody, it’s indiscriminate. “The tumour that mum had started in the brain, and stayed in the brain, but the rest of her body was cancer-free.”You can access Lisaaposs fundraiser forbrain tumour research here.Matthew Price, community development manager for Brain Tumour Research, said: “Our sincere condolences go to Lisa, Jason and Peter, and to all those who knew and loved Marion. “Less than % of those diagnosed with a brain tumour survive beyond five years compared with an average of % across all cancers. Unlike most other cancers, incidences of and deaths from brain tumours are rising. “We are very grateful for Lisa’s support and are thinking of her and all of Marion’s loved ones at this very dficult time.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Willington PLCMarion GreenwoodLisa HarrisonHospitalsBlood pressure\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Royal Mail. Donapost even think about putting a card through the door without ringing the doorbell and pretending that the delivery was attempted but no one was in - as happened on Saturday, the passive aggressive note read. We were in all day and weaposll be in today, Tuesday. RING THE BELL AND DELIVER THE PARCEL.  Itaposs fair to say that Dave was not happy with the message, and later posted a photo of the note on a social media group of postmen and women, saying he hopes the family enjoy collecting their mail from the post office over Christmas. Enraged postmen and women rallied behind their colleague, condemning the residentaposs cheeky and awful attitude pointing out that no postie would want to hold onto someoneaposs mail longer than necessary. Dozens backed Daveaposs stance and suggested he issue Ps from here on - Royal Mailaposs code for their apossorry we missed each otherapos attempted delivery red note. Donapost know about anyone  but I love carrying parcels around with me all day making my bag heavy, one postie joked, while another questioned: Why do people never think that itaposs actually much easier for us to get packets delivered and not have to take them back to the office. Dave, who had been completing that round for the past decade, says itaposs the second time heaposs been spoken to like this and that he has no plans to deliver there again in the future.  In a series of comments responding to questions from other postal workers, Dave said: [Iaposm] not planning on delivering there in the future, itaposs the second time Iaposve been spoken to like this along with the van share guy. [They] stopped tipping a few years ago after accusing one of us of theft and speaking to us like sh*t. It wasnapost me [who left the attempted delivery note], probably a parcel driver but itaposs my delivery Iaposve had for the last  years. [But it] would have been one of the parcels we left for someone  to do, either way itaposs aimed at us. On the positive side, I got a nice tip from one of the decent customers not long after.

But, this isnapost the first time Dave has found himself clashing with customers, having previously bragged about writing a naughty list, with anyone who leaves notes for posties going straight on there. In June , he wrote: Iaposll gladly stand in the p***ing rain and cold to write out a  for someone like that, they will never get off the naughty list as long as Iaposm on the duty. Any note left on door saying waiting for a Christmas present or passport leave with neighbour or some other place, no can do bud, enjoy your trip. Meanwhile, other postal workers were quick to comment sharing their own experiences with rude customers, with one writing: Thereaposs always one idiot. I had someone swear at me because I rang the bell three times because I knew she was in. aposI was in the f***ing shower, I heard you the f***ing first time.apos Form left after that. A second said: Itaposs psychological, I have someone on my round always thinking Iaposm holding back their parcels, itaposs personal. Usually stuff from China, cheapest postage. They donapost understand the journey their thing has taken. I reckon virtually every round in the country has at least one of those. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: Every single item of mail is important to us. Our postmen and women work extremely hard to deliver to mail to customers across the country, six days a week, in all weathers. Thankfully the vast majority of items are securely delivered to customers, butwe believe a customer is not at home, we will attempt to deliver the item to a neighbour and leave a card. If we canapost deliver to them, weaposll leave a card and take the item back to the Customer Service Point where customers can either collect it or arrange a redelivery.

Katie Dean says there have been problems since they moved into the house in Hull in September . Images from inside show plaster peeling off walls, a hole in one ceiling, as well as extensive damp and mould. The mum claims that her -year-old daughter moved out because she was too embarrassed to live there.Katie, who lives in the house with her partner, toddler child and with a baby on the way, told HullLive: Itaposs not liveable. My key worker from Target Housing has been and Iaposve told him I want moving out of the property, itaposs seriously affecting my mental health. My -year-old has moved out of the house to live with her dad, partly because it was too embarrassing to bring people around. She is also worried about her toddler, who she claims is getting chest infections. Katie, who is in her s, said Target Housing has responded to her and that some repairs have been attempted. The repairs included the replacement of a boiler  days after the previous version packed up, the fitting of a dormer window, an extractor fan and a new radiator installed in the bathroom.  However, Katie claims itaposs barely scratched the surface of all the houseaposs signicant issues. She says that work to insulate the roof and prevent a leak in the attic had not been effective. She said: Weaposve actually now found that it is still leaking and the roof is all damp and wet. Itaposs disgusting - itaposs actually growing mould on it and I canapost get rid of it.  I had a new window fitted, a new dormer window, thataposs brilliant. But the mould above it must be because of a leak and itaposs like growing. Katie claims a new radiator that was fitted in the bathroom led to signicant damage to the wall beside it, which she was still waiting for to be repaired. She further claimed that the issues with the houseaposs living room - damp walls, the adjacent hallway wall falling through and being too cold - are so extensive that the family had effectively abandoned using it.  She said: I mean, my living room was beautul. I adore ornaments because thataposs what Iaposm into. And I canapost use none of it because it would just end up on the floor smashed and broken because of the walls and things. She added: This was only to be temporary until I got my money, finances, things like that, sorted out.  She added they were moved in with the assistance of Target Housing and were paying back prior rent arrears to the council. Members of Hull City Councilaposs environmental health team have also visited the property two times, Katie said. She added: Andthey canapost work around us doing that, then move us out.

And he added that that the many job resignations during the Covid pandemic arenapost all bad.In the interview with Fast Company, he explained: While on the surface it looks like these last couple of years brought all these issues to the foreground, the reality is these struggles and issues have been brewing for quite some time.We’re just at the beginning of the mental health awakening. This work has never been more important because people are finally paying attention, and a big component of this mission is building awareness and continuing to pioneer the conversation.

I’ve actually discovered recently, courtesy of a chat with [BetterUp science board member] Adam Grant, that a lot of the job resignations you mention aren’t all bad. In fact, it is a sign that with self-awareness comes the need for change. Many people around the world have been stuck in jobs that didn’t bring them joy, and now they’re putting their mental health and happiness first. This is something to be celebrated. Harry joined BetterUp in March and the start-up focuses on coaching people on their mental health to help peopleaposs performance. It offers custom support and services that strengthen mental fitness, with the aim of allowing customers to unleash personal and professional performance.Explaining his decision to take the job, Harry previously told the Wall Street Journal : “I intend to help create impact in people’s lives.“Proactive coaching provides endless possibilities for personal development, increased awareness, and an all-round better le.”The companyaposs chief has kept his lips sealed on how much Harry is paid for his role. But Colin Plamondon, a US-based apps investor, previously told the Mirror the royalaposs star appeal to clients could bring handsome compensation £, to £ million a year at a minimum including salary and equity.The new job is one of a number of new roles Harry and Meghan have secured since quitting the royal family last year.They have also signed multi-million dollar contracts with Netflix and Spoty and become investors in an ethical investment company.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She said: “We grow our own vegetables. We’ve got carrots, beans, beetroot — a massive favourite — Louis absolutely loves beetroot.” And Mary was so impressed with Louisaposs choice - she then went on to show viewers how to make a beetroot and chocolate cake.

She said that her children love to “make salads and stuff” as well as their signature dish, cheesy pasta. Meanwhile, it seems that Prince George is partial to a classic Italian dish - spaghetti carbonara. It was once revealed by his proud dad Prince William to TV chef Aldo Zilli, who told FEMAIL : [Williamaposs] amazing - Iaposm waiting for the call because apparently, his little boyaposs favourite is spaghetti carbonara, so Iaposm waiting for the call to go and cook it for him.If George has my carbonara, he will never have another one, so I need to go and make it, letaposs get the ball rolling, send me to the palace to cook!However, there is one royal who never tells anybody what her favourite food is, and thataposs the Queen. And thereaposs a rather good reason why what she likes best is kept so secret.  A royal insider explained how the Queen doesnapost ulge her favourite food before travelling so that she isnapost served the same thing everywhere she goes. As reported by The Express, Gordon Rayner, former royal correspondent for Thewho has covered more than  royal tours, said heaposd discovered this fact from a royal staff member.He said: As one of her staff told me, ‘If she said she had a favourite meal she would never get served anything .’ Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal FamilyPrince Louis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He maintained he was simply leaving the sauna in facilities that were often shared with female riders. Frost alleged Dunne had called her a “f****** whore” and a “dangerous ****” after a race last year. He categorically denies using such language. A witness claimed he’d called her “a f****** slut”.  Other jockeys maintain they’d heard “nothing out of the ordinary.” Several female jockeys gave evidence that while he was “not to everyone’s taste”, they did not find him “inappropriate” or “bullying”. Make up your own mind. Frost wept last week as she spoke of the way she said been ostracised by her colleagues for even raising her claims with the authorities. But she insisted the other female jockeys were terried of talking for fear of being exiled from racing’s equivalent of the dressing room – the weighing room. “Personally speaking,” she said, “the isolation I have found from speaking out, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I feel they are protecting themselves and staying neutral.”  Whatever the verdict in this week’s case, you wouldn’t blame Frostshe were to quit British racing. It would ­represent a huge blow for a sport desperately trying to attract younger audiences and participants. But to read last week’s evidence, you might interpret a toxic climateyou are dferent.The British Horseracing Authority, the sport’s rulers, has concluded the culture of the weighing room “condones threatening behaviour and frowns upon the reporting of it”.Another female jockey, Hannah Welch, gave evidence at last week’s hearing and spoke of an incident in her early s when she claimed she was shouted and sworn at by Dunne and left in tears. The other jockeys looked on. No one, she said, stood up for her. She has since quit. Another female jockey, Leonna Mayor, claimed on TV at the weekend that she’d been bullied by a trainer she wouldn’t name. The sport has serious questions to answer. Frost is entirely right to stand up for what she believes in.

For others, it brings money worries, and having to make the tough decision as to whether to heat their home, or eat their next meal. Four years ago, Debi Emmett decided to take action and do something to alleviate the stress for pet owners who found themselves in hard times, by setting up a pet food bank service.And this year alone, she’s provided , meals to animals across South Wales, up , the previous year.The -year-old said: “A friend told me about dog’s homes being overrun with elderly dogs because everyone wanted puppies. I thought it was terrible, and as it’s usually older people who adopt older dogs, these are the kinds of people who already struggle with the heat or eating issue. “But these dogs are their worlds and in order to keep them on sofas and out of shelters, we started up the pet food bank.”  Debi, from Cardf, started the charity solo, and would collect and deliver pet food in the area, but Covid- brought new challenges, changing the way the food bank operated. Instead, she began delivering to other food banks with established users, who were elated to discover that there was dog food in their food parcels. Debi’s heart broke when she heard a story from one woman who was struggling financially, and resorted to feeding her dog pasta. The charity founder said: “One lady said ‘I have nothing in the house so I fed my dog pasta - I know it’s no good for them but it’s all I had’. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December .

The pet food bank service helps people in financial crises, the homeless, and throughout the pandemic, many furloughed workers.  The -year-old added: “It’s not just homeless people we help. In the pandemic there were airline pilots who thought they had a job for le, suddenly found themselves out of work and lost all their income. “It’s not necessarily people who can’t afford their animals, it’s people who found themselves in a dficult situation through no fault of their own.” And Christmas is set to be an incredibly busy time for Debi, who spends up to  hours a week collecting and delivering food to outlets in Cardf, Newport, Caerphilly, Swansea, Gilfach Goch, Merthyr and Bargoed. But after a year like no other, it’s set to be a festive season like no other for the charity, too, with Debi expecting more and more demand for pet food throughout December.

She said: “We have provided more than , meals for pets this year, and the sad part is, that could have easily been doubledwe weren’t restricted by our storage size. “Normally in November and December we don’t get asked for that much food, instead people are donating it because they’re feeling generous, and then it gets sent out to families in January. “But this year we’re expecting a lot of people in need of our service at Christmas, and we need that generosity to continue so we have enough food for December, January and February.” As well as pet food, Debi also collects coats for homeless dogs, as well as leads, collars, harnesses and blankets for pet owners who might need them. The animal lover - who has a rescue French bulldog, called Ruby - hopes to open a café in the future, complete with doggy play area and extra storage, where service users will be able to socialise. She added: “Next year I’m looking to start fundraising for a café, but property in Cardf is quite expensive.

And one couple has made the Christmas wish of an adorable three-legged whippet puppy named Roo come true, as they’ve given her a forever home just in time for the big day. Roo was born with just one front leg and at two months old her previous owners gave her to the Blue Cross charity because they didn’t have time to care for her. The pooch was placed into foster care to adapt to a home environment and after being put up for adoption, she was quickly snapped up by her new owners, Amanda and Steve Hofford.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The couple, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, lost their beloved basset hound Mabel just after last Christmas and say Roo has helped fill the void in their lives. Amanda said: We had never been without a dog for  years so to say that we all felt the loss was an understatement. All our previous six dogs had been rescue dogs, so it was a no brainer to rescue again. When we saw her on the Blue Cross website, she was absolutely adorable. We read her story and knew we had to try to adopt her. The whole process and understanding to our situation was amazing.  She was a much wanted and needed addition to our family. Everyone she meets and greets falls in love with her. She is so funny, inquisitive, loving, lively and we wouldnapost be without her. Roo quickly settled into le in her forever home, and she doesn’t let her disability stop her from doing everything a four-legged dog would do. And Amanda says the adorable pooch loves nothing more than cuddling up on the sofa with her new owners, making friends with other dogs in the park and playing with her toys. The woman added: When Roo came to us she had been so wonderfully taken care of by her foster family and Blue Cross that she was a delight. She settled straight away on the first day, it was like she had lived here her whole little le. She has a front leg missing but this is no obstacle to her at all. She runs around, flies up and down the stairs and does absolutely everything a four-legged dog would do. Absolutely nothing stops her, we often forget she has a leg missing as this has never been an issue. We have had to make no accommodations to her being three legged because she takes her whole le in her stride and lives it to the full.Anyone wishing to adopt an animal from the Blue Cross or wishing to make a donation to the charity can visit: https:www.bluecross.org.uk christmas.Have you got a hopeful story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Vina Shaddick paid just £ for the lights during a shopping trip to Woolworths in . When she died in  they were inherited by her son Ross Farr-Semmens, . Ross hopes to pass the lights onto his daughter Ronnie, currently eight months old. He said: “It is literally magic that they can still be part of all the Christmas festivities.

I got married to my amazing we Ruth, and we’ve also had a newborn baby who’s now eight months old. “With mum buying them in  it really is just amazing to be part of their continuing success and special place in the household helping us all to celebrate Christmas in style.” The lights, which are attached to a s plastic Christmas tree, were turned on today. Last year there was a brief moment of concern when the bulbs took several seconds to light up.  But music teacher Ross, of Plymouth, Devon, has consulted an electrician to check they are still safe. He said: “We’ve never needed to change a bulb, which is good because I’ve lost track of where the spares were.” Ross even considered paying to have all the wiring updated.

The house holder, who has not been named, was trying to use smoke to tackle a snake infestation in his home. Firefighters reported a blaze had broken out at house in Poolseville,  miles outside Washington DC.Pete Piringer, a spokesman for the Montgomery County Fire Department, said on Twitter : Homeowner using smoke to manage snake infestation, it is believed heat sourcetoo close to combustibles,Reports say more than  firefighters were called to the location after fire broke out at around pm on November .  The fire is thought to have started in the houseaposs basement and is estimated to have caused around  millionin damage.Mr Piringer said no one was at home when the fire started, but the homeowner was there a few hours earlier, according to reports on CNN.Emergency services were called after a concerned neighbour raised the alarm.  Photos shared on social networking site Twitter by Mr Piringer show the home was completely engulfed by the flames and was reduced to rubble by the time it was extinguished. The fire spread from the basement and consumed the home, officials say and images show flames coming from the roof and second-story windows. Mr Piringer said on Twitter the condition of the reptiles was not known. He said no humans were injured in the blaze, but status of snakes [is] undetermined.  The fire department’s public information officer revealed more details and described the cause as “accidental” and the reason was given as the “homeowner using smoke to manage snake infestation”. Authorities say the heat source for ridding the home of reptiles was coals, which were “too close to combustibles”. The fire originated in the “basement, walls floor” of the property.Mr Piringer told CNN : There are animal services that can come out and make recommendations, or pest control, or an exterminator.We recommend you have professionals deal with any pest control issue to help maintain the situation.

In the clip, filmed in Georgia, US, a huge ape-like creature can be seen lurking behind some trees, while the witness films from some distance away.The beast then stands - revealing that it is impressively tall, although in the shaky footage it is hard to tell exactly how big the animal is, as the Daily Star reports.The footage has been widely shared on social media and people are convinced it is a genuine Bigfoot sighting, and even experts seem to agree.  What do you think, is Bigfoot real  Let us know in the comments... The video was shared on Instagram by the account @cryptiduniversity which regularly uploads clips of mysterious creatures.One viewer said: Best footage Iaposve seen in a while - that thing was huge. A more sceptical-sounding viewer said: They do all sorts of things for attention down in Georgia.Seth Breedslove, a documentary maker and the man behind Small Town Monsters film production company, said the video might be a hoax but there was room for doubt.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. He said: The subject seems to be very large but the movement possibly gives away the potential for some trickery. The subject seems to be looking down at the ground as it turns indicating it might be a person in a suit who is having some dficulty judging the forest floor beneath them. It makes me think this is more than likely a hoax.  The filmmaker, whose latest documentary On The Trail of Bigfoot is now available on Amazon, added: The thing does appear to be large though, so maybe it’s real  These videos always leave us with more questions than answers.Legends of Bigfoot in the US gained momentum in  when loggers found a giant footprint in Bluff Creek, Calornia, and it became a national news story.

But every year I fail Image: Elizabeth HaighopinionByElizabeth Haigh:,  Dec | commentsI have a confession to make. I’m a vegetarian. But I’m also a pigs in blankets addict. It’s pm on Christmas Day. You can picture the scene: the light is fading, the selection box has been emptied, the dinner plates cleaned. The argument over whether to watch Home Alone or How The Grinch Stole Christmas has finally been settled without injury, thank goodness, and Jim Carrey can sigh in relief that the number one Christmas film of all time has, again, won out. As my family gathers round the screen, exhausted, I’m putting the last of the clean dishes away and covering up the leftovers. I glance furtively towards the open living room door. Not a peep. I tiptoe to the stairs, head cocked like a spaniel, to checkany stragglers are ing from the bathroom after one too many glasses of festive spirit. Nothing. The meat leftovers from Christmas Dinner are sitting on the turkey dish, the only one left uncovered. Five perfect, neatly wrapped, rather smug-looking sausages line the side of the plate, each cuddled up in its own bacon blanket. They’re practically calling my name. I shouldn’t. I definitely shouldn’t. That third mince pie was already a huge mistake: there’s only a certain amount of food a human can take before exploding, right  Quick as a flash, my fingers dart out uncontrollably. One, two, three, enter my mouth one after the other.Are you a bad vegetarian  Tell us about your slip-ups in the comments below Oh, that sublime saltiness! My taste buds sing in gratitude as I noisily foil the plate to cover up the sounds of chewing. “What are you doing in there ” calls my Dad. When I was a child, on Christmas morning he was the guard dog of the kitchen. The only thing stopping my brother and I from gobbling those delicious morsels straight out of the oven. My heart starts racing. I can feel my palms sweating. “Nothing!” I say, quickly. Too quickly. I curse myself under my breath: you almost got away with it. Why are you flushing like a five-year-old who’s been caught drawing on the wall  You’re , for goodness sake. “Are you sure ” “Yes! Just coming now.” I place the last plate inside the already crammed fridge and head into the living room, swallowing the last of the final sausage. Heads turn as I enter, and I smile. “Sorry, just had some trouble with the kitchen foil,” I lie, fairly convincingly. They nod and look back at the screen. Victory is mine!  No part of the Christmas feasting tempts me after four years of meat sobriety. Except those damned pigs in blankets. Every year I swear blind this will be the year I finally master my addiction. It’s time to go cold turkey. No pigs in blankets for me. But every year, I fail. I find myself creeping around corners, desperate to snaffle a cheeky treat while maintaining my vegetarian badge of honour. And I get away with it. The next morning, someone might scratch their head and exclaim: “I’m sure we had more left than that!” But by that time, I’m long gone, and so are my piggish cravings.

Scout, a Labrador cross Catahoula leopard dog, shows just how much energy she has in this incredible display of athleticism and enthusiasm. The excitable dog’s reaction when she first hears the word “run” from her owner was amusing enough as she repeatedly lets out an adorable high pitched squeal. But viewers are then shown how powerful the dog is as she begins to sprint, pulling her owner along with her. As the Lab cross is first shown on camera, her owner utters the magic word and she’s off, bounding around the garden in excitement. She changes into her harness and waits impatiently at the gate for her owner, barking as she jumps.  Once the two leave the garden, Scout has to hold back just a few more seconds before she gets the signal to set off properly. But once the dog gets the go ahead, she wastes no time, instantly beginning a full sprint, dragging her owner along on a skateboard behind as she goes. The rest of the clip shows just how fast and for how long Scout can carry her owner behind her, in an impressive feat of athleticism. Scout is even careful to look back and check on her owner at every turn, showing she is caring as well as full of energy.The video was uploaded by TikTok user @thisisscout, and the clip was a huge hit on the video sharing , with over , views and over , likes.Viewers were impressed with Scout’s energy, with one user commenting: “I think she was a sled dog in a former le. She loves it!” Another commenter wrote: “I just love hearing her squeaky bark of excitement and pure joy when she first starts to pull.” A third added: “I love how your dog keeps looking back to seeyou’re still good.”Scout isn’t the only energetic Lab to have garnered attention on social media recently, after Duke’s reaction to going to potty in the garden tickled Facebook users.The Labrador was incredibly excited after using the backyard to go to the toilet, sprinting all round the grass and the decking. Duke’s owner was very amused by her dog in the clip, praising him as he bounded round the garden. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter.Another Labrador cross to have enjoyed TikTok success of late was Jake, whose habit of taking a torch with him to use the toilet in the dark amused viewers.Jake takes the torch from his owner before being let out into the garden to use the toilet. The clever dog uses the trick to combat his fear of the dark, obediently bringing the torch back to his owner when he is finished.

The dad-of-four, who currently has more than , followers, created his first Yorkie pie by filling a pudding with mash potato and smoothing it out with a spoon. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. He then added pulled pork, before adding a perfectly round slice of cheese on top, before repeating both steps again. Roland then placed a pastry lid on top of the creation and topped it with egg wash, before placing it in the oven for  minutes. At the end of the clip, the project manager can be seen revealing the golden brown result, before slicing right into the middle of it, to reveal a gooey cross section. Roland then reveals the golden-brown result and slices his concoction in half to show the gooey, delicious cross-section. It tasted seriously good. I went for pulled pork as I had some leftover. I did a Yorkshire toastie video, then suddenly thought that a Yorkie would make a perfect pie base, the dad explained. Fill it and stick a pastry lid on it. The kids loved it. I checked through TikTok and couldn’t see that anybody  had done it. It got a really good response. The clip received more than . million views and after collecting so many positive comments, Roland decided to create a number of dferent iations of the dish, including one which featured a filling of KFC popcorn chicken. Yes mate that looks incredible, while another suggested: You need to make your own puds mate you can’t use ant Bessie’s up here. Nah thataposs a Yorkshire lasagne pal, a third commented, while another said he deserved to go straight to jail for creating the concoction.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

A photographer explored Sursock Palace, one of the last remaining residences of the Lebanese Ottoman-era which is directly in line with the disaster site. Former owner, Lady Cochrane Sursock, was inside the luxury residence during the Port of Beruit explosion but died in hospital sometime later. Despite being built in the s, the luxury residence is still a part of its namesake’s family who are committed to restoring it. A reconstruction plan for the property is expected to take six years and cost an estimated €million Roman Robroek, , a full-time photographer from the Netherlands, was able to get inside the palace to capture not only the damage, but some of the impressive surviving features as well. He said: “Photographing Sursock Palace was part of a project I was shooting for The Heritage Management Organization last summer, where I was covering the impact of the blast that happened in the Port of Beirut in August  on the architecture and cultural heritage in the city. “For this project, we partnered with a local NGO called Silat for culture.  The lovely people of Silat for culture took care of my daily schedule, driving and arranging all the required permissions to enter the locations in the city. A lot of work was involved. “The owner of the palace, Roderick Cochrane, was kind enough to open the doors of his palace for me to photograph the damage caused by the blast.” In addition to art pieces, paintings, books and china, rooms directly facing the harbour where the explosion happened were most damaged. Roman said: “Trust me, the harbour is really close to the palace. All of the glass was shattered and much of the indoor stucco was damaged “The amount of damage I encountered was a big surprise to me. It was tough to see the impact of the blast on the architecture and state of the building. There was so much debris and valuable items were damaged.”  The extent of the destruction can be seen in the once intricately decorated ceiling, which has now been replaced with a temporary metal roof to weatherproof the site and prevent further damage. In hopes of structurally preserving the building, the exterior is clad in scaffolding and netting. Inside, ornate walls and exposed beams are being supported with multiple metal structures. The former grandeur of the palace is still detectable in certain rooms. The elaborate golden front door, stone pillars and arched windows are just a few of the impressive features.  Roman added: “The main and double staircase of the building is one of the features that stood out to me. The craftsmanship in the ironwork and the chandelier are stunning.” The building and its contents were never insured resulting in ious international organisations, university students and other parties stepping in to offer extra support to save its historic grandeur.  The palaceaposs origin goes back to Constantinople and the Sursocks have been recorded as living in Beirut since . The owneraposs wealth is said to have came from in the early th century primarly in agriculture and later in manufacturingAccording to its website, the Sursock empire extended from Mersine, Turkey to Alexandria, Egypt passing by Lebanon, Cyprus and Palestine.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

It is not #green# to have to do a -mile car journey for essentials.#The Co-op also seems to be replacing many branded items with their own products which are nowhere near as good.#He believes this policy is #pricing out rural living#, and continued: #It is particularly hard-hitting for those less mobile, non-car owners and the elderly.#Come on Co-op, a change needs to happen.#His post attracted a big response # with people in other parts of Argyll and Bute supporting his views.Mr Bates has since written directly to the Co-op, but emphasised: #The excellent hard-working management and staff at the Co-op in Tarbert are a big part of our community and are very helpful and kind. They have no control over pricing and stocking policy, which is decided by the board.#Stressing that the supermarket operates a UK pricing policy, a Co-op spokesperson said: #Co-op is committed to serving and supporting its rural communities, conveniently, including areas where other retailers often do not trade due to the increased operational costs.#Like all retailers, Co-op has experienced some patchy disruption to the availability of some products, and it is working with suppliers to re-stock as quickly as possible.#Alongside well-known brands, Co-op#s award-winning own-brand products provide shoppers with choice # delivering quality and value, while also enabling customers and community causes to unlock additional value and benefits through its membership programme.#Mr Bates added: #The Co-op bosses in Manchester need to realise that the Tarbert Co-op and others in rural locations are not convenience stores. These are often the only store for miles and are therefore leline stores.#If they do not understand this, then they do not understand the communities they are serving.#Speaking on Wednesday this week, Mr Bates said he had received no reply from Co-op management.He said ##apart from an automated receipt reply, I have heard nothing further.

Early religious writings tell the story that Thenew was a victim of her fatherrsquos cruel vengeance for what he believed to be her disobedience and wrongful behaviour.One early medieval account by Jocelinus, a monk from Furness, tells us: ldquoBy the kingrsquos command, she was led to the top of a very high hill called Dunpelder, that, cast down from thence, she might be broken limb by limb, or dashed to pieces.But that didnrsquot work, so she was instead taken to the shore of Aberlady and put into the small hide vessel, pulled from the shore and set adrt.Magsrsquo art captures the terror and desperation of Thenewrsquos situation, as her tiny boat is taken by the tide out to the open sea. It is rocked by waves and she clings on for le, the freezing water lapping over her.But thankfully, there is a happy ending to this story. Her small boat begins to drt inland, across the Firth of Forth, away from the kingdom of her abuser and towards the opposite shore, where she lands just in time. There, on the beach by Culross in Fe, she finds a fire with embers still giving warmth.Jocelinus tells us: ldquoThere were, in the neighbourhood, shepherds keeping watch over the flocks. And they beheld a fire lighted close at hand, and coming with haste found the young woman with her childbirth completed, and the child wrapped in rags, lying in the open air. They, moved by pity, took care of them by increasing the fire and supplying food, and procuring other necessarieshellipSt Serf took them in and cared for them, and Thenewrsquos child would become Saint Kentigern.This story is not provable history, of course, more likely itrsquos mostly legend making. Yet unknown truths often lie under the surface of legends and I for one have always seen the universal truths in this story.When I look into the faces of my children, I hope and pray they will never feel the fear and desperation that is on the face of Thenew of being cast at sea with the desperate hope of finding a safe place.And , God forbid, they ever do, I hope they will be met by people like those shepherds.Andever they, or I, were to meet someone in such a desperate situation, then I hope we would be like those shepherds and respond with kindness, understanding and compassion.That, for

Now she claims that ldquothe Covid infection fatality rate is more or less the same as flu: .%. In fact the data show that there have been  million positive Covid tests, , deaths within  days of a positive test, and , deaths with Covid- on the death certicate. That gives rates of .% and .%, either  or  times the figure Ms Blythman has plucked from the air, or from a wild and wacky website.Particularly obnoxious are Ms Blythmanrsquos personal attacks on Professor Susan Michie, head of the Health Psychology Research Group at University College London, and Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency. Ms Blythman refers to ldquogrim-faced Harries and Michiehellip in their s, no young familyhellip. She says of Dr Harries: ldquoHer appearance would cause the mince pies to chill on the plate.How rude, how silly, how pathetic. When Ms Blythman descends to personal abuse, shersquos simply a troll, someone who spews bile and conspiracy theories in the hope of stirring up a storm. I expect better in The Herald.Covid isnrsquot finished with us and, after all wersquove been through, we mustnrsquot give up now. No doubt there were some in the UK who thought it would be a good idea to throw in the towel in , after two years of war and restrictions. Thank goodness wiser heads prevailed then, and I hope wiser heads than Ms Blythmanrsquos will prevail now, for all our sakes.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.* JOANNA Blythman states: \"No one in South Africa is known to have been hospitalised with the Omicron iant\" yet in the same edition Helen McArdle writes: In South Africa hospitalisations with Omicron are rising\" world of uncertainty, caution makes good sense\", The Herald, December . These two statements appear to be incompatible. Which one is correct  Personally I will be following Ms McArdles advice and being cautious. If I attend a party and Ms Blythman is present, probably not wearing a mask, I think I will take the cautious approach and find another party.Angus McKee, Glasgow.THE ART OF THE POSSIBLEBRIAN Chrystalasks us whether David Watson ldquohas a point in his criticism of the Scottish Government not acting in the face of Omicron. Yet, as Professor Linday Bauld has pointed out, ldquowe do not yet know the full extent of the challenge that will emerge in practice from Omicron.The guiding principle of Government policy regarding Covid has been that the restrictions should be proportionate to the degree of threat, sowe donrsquot know the full degree of threat how can we take proportionate action However, a wider dficulty is that each of us would place dferent weights on the conflicting aims of controlling the virus and the needs of parts of the economy, so it is almost inevitable that there will be those who will consider Government policy too draconian or too lax. Indeed, policy in Scotland has, over the course of the pandemic been characterised as the former, compared to England, and as the Financial Times noted in February, the First Ministerrsquos ldquogreater willingness to maintain restrictions has helped Scotland keep deaths and infections lower than in England.Of course, it can be argued that we should take a high level of precaution in the face of a threat which may be serious, that we donrsquot wait till we find it is serious. There is, though, another issue ndash how far will the public go in respecting new, additional restrictions  The current environment is radically dissimilar to that after the announcement of the first lockdown, when it would not be going too far to say people were frightened into following restrictions.Therefore,constraints on our behaviour are not going to be followed, and cannot be enforced, what point do they have  Is it not better to put in place the maximum limitations that most of the community can be encouraged to follow Rather than issues of right or wrong, or having a point or not, the more important and comprehensive judgement is that this is an instance that, as Harold Wilson observed, ldquoPolitics is the art of the possible.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WILL LESSONS REALLY BE LEARNED I WAS beyond disgusted reading in Saturdays Herald about the horric way Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was treated and then murdered by his stepmother . I am not in favour of capital punishment but would definitely make an exception in the case of Ms Tustin. The father deserves no better and what failures as human beings both of them are.Despite warnings by family members, the system let down a decent wee boy and how social services could have missed this is beyond belief. Somebody deserves their jotters for this. No doubt \"lessons will be learned\" and it wont happen again, until the next time.Iain Harrison, Linlithgow.SICKENING LEVEL OF INHUMANITYMANY of us who have lived through the biblical lespan and beyond, including myself, will have reckoned that we had come to know in the world seriously awful levels of human depravity. We had come to believe that we had seen or been made aware of the worst that people were capable of. How wrong we were. I refer to the awful circumstances of the murder of young Arthur Labinjo-Hughes.Many will have been profoundly moved by the cruelty shown to that young, innocent child. I was greatly moved about the circumstances of the le Arthur was living ndash wondering when he would next be struck or bullied wondering when he would next be fed and failing to understand why he was being treated in such a despicable way. The fact that a young child could be treated with such viciousness is beyond human comprehension.It made one emotional to think of the many families who would have been pleased to take care of this little boy. I have no doubt many tears have been shed by those reading of and listening to descriptions of how Arthur was treated during his short le. His treatment and eventual loss of le represents for me a sickening and depressing level of manrsquos inhumanity to man.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.HOW COULD ANY GOD ALLOW THIS THESE past few days have seen coverage of the heart breaking story of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, tortured and killed by his father and stepmother.The tormentors of this lovely-looking wee boy have been given long prison sentences, though whether they are enough is doubtful given the evil that obviously resides in those two iniduals who, according to court comments, showed no remorse.Most of us reading the reports of how this wee boy was treated and his calls for help: \"no one loves me\", \"who will feed me \", would feel their heart break and yet, and yet.Many of these same people, whilst in despair at just how low some of our fellow human beings can reach, are members of a church of religion and are sure of their faith. Regardless of the conduit that they believe allows them to worship, praise and exalt God ndash Christianity, Islam, Judaism and many more ndash they all have in common that God is an all-seeing, benevolent being without sin who looks after us all regardless of our role in society, especially the weak and little children. Some even believe He can forgive sincertain words are offered.Well, where was this God when the poor wee soul Arthur needed him  What had he done at the age of six to have been abandoned by God and given to the depraved iniduals who took the le of this innocent People of faith will argue we were given free will ,but Arthurs death does not square with their belief that God loves us all, and of course when challenged by those of us not taken in by fairy stories when we say how can you square the circle reply: \"Ah, but we have faith.\"Its pathetic and intellectually indefensible. Rest in peace, Arthur.James Martin, Bearsden.MARR WILL NOT BE MISSEDThank goodness Andrew Marr is leaving the BBC.

With around  voices, rushing back to singing together unmasked would, of course, have been inconceivable. The road back to singing together in person had to paved with careful blocks, each building a little more confidence for members.There will be no audience at Bearsden Choirrsquos first live performance together. The Countdown to Christmas is five short pieces of seasonal music, which will be filmed. One will be broadcast on each of the five days running up to Christmas Day. There has been careful preparation for the moment when  voices come together with musicians at Kingsborough Sanctuary to record the performances. You can view a preview of the rehearsal here.Keeping the choir connected during the height of the pandemic was the greatest priority. Using Zoom, it was clear that members were equally keen to maintain that connection, with around  logging in to weekly singing rehearsals. These became ldquoInspire sessions, with not only guest appearances from the likes of composer John Rutter but well-being sessions covering everything from vocal technique to yoga.The choirrsquos planned performance of Mendelssohnrsquos Elijah was thwarted by lockdown, but the next step was to encourage members to upload videos of themselves singing their parts of two movements at home, which was brought together and broadcast ndash no mean feat when there were more than  members taking part.The choirrsquos next step was in May ndash a critically acclaimed online performance of Vivaldirsquos Gloria. ldquoThis was the next step, says Director of Music Andrew Nunn. ldquoIt was a hybrid performance, blending virtual recordings with live recordings that I made of soloists and musicians.As much as the choir would have loved being back with their audience this Christmas, it was clear that this next step needed to be taken slowly and safely.ldquoWe knew that we wouldnrsquot be back in our usual home, the City Halls in Glasgow, this year, says Bearsden Choir chairman John Wotton. ldquoWe need to look at the safety of our members, their families and our audience and we made a decision for the long-term health and success of the choir.We will look at Bearsden Choirrsquos Countdown to Christmas programme in detail next week. The preparation to its recording has taken several months, beginning with the first in-person rehearsals at Maryhill Burgh Hall in September. John Wotton says that the members were consulted at every stage, using online tools such as Google Polls to get feedback from members on how they wanted to proceed and how they couldto in-person singing together in a way that would allow them to feel safe.The choir members were required to be fully vaccinated and to rehearse in a mask. He adds that the choir has not lost members as a result of these precautions and these careful steps have allowed the membership to build their confidence in theto live singing.ldquoWersquove done a lot of research, adds John. ldquoThe choir is also a member of an organisation called Making Music, an organisation that provided advice, which was updated regularly.Rehearsals at Maryhill Burgh Halls were taken in two shts to allow for social distancing and when it came to a performance space, John and Andrew Nunn spent two days looking for the right space.ldquoWe decided on Kingsborough Sanctuary, says Andrew. ldquoItrsquos the former Hyndland Parish Church and we could see that it was a space that would not only be acoustically excellent, but also, now that the pews are removed, there is room for the  members taking part in the performance. This is the first that will be done unmasked.John adds that every member has been asked to take a Covid test on the morning of the performance. ldquoThe measures we have taken so far means that we have stayed Covid-free and we want that to remain so that we can begin the year looking forward to rehearsals for ourto the City Halls in May , when we will be with our audience once again, performing a large-scale work.Bearsden Choirrsquos Countdown to Christmas will be broadcast online from December  to .Watch at Bearsden Choirrsquos own website bearsdenchoir, its YouTube channel or its Facebook page. as well as The Heraldrsquos website and Facebook pagewww.facebook bearsdenchoir https:twitter BearsdenChoir ref_srctwsrc%Egoogle%Ctwcamp%Eserp%Ctwgr%Eauthor"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive accessas we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive pound for two months offer here.From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expectground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content ndash as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just pound for two monthshere.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as ldquounsatisfactory on pollution, according to data from the ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oilcompanies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as ldquovery poor in .

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

These are:ldquoWomenwho were orced at pension age but whose pension was not assessed on the basis of their ex-spousersquos contributionsldquoWomenwho orced post pension age and notied DWP of this fact but where their pension was not reassessed on the basis of their ex-spousersquos contributions.Problems with underpayments came to light when Sir Steve, along with This is Money, brought inidual cases to the DWPrsquos attention ndash and Sir Steve said he believed the ldquosystemic problems originally found may also exist for some orced women.The letter says: ldquoIf the Department accepts that a failure to act on a change in circumstances can cause widows and others to be underpaid, why not accept that orced women could be missing out for exactly the same reason Sir Steve said growing examples have emerged of orced women who had previously been underpaid due to errors, including:ndash A woman who was orced when she reached pension age was not assessed on the basis of her ex-husbandrsquos contributions. She was underpaid for  years and was recently awarded a back-payment of over pound,ndash Another woman who was orced when she retired and was told she had no state pension entitlement. When she recently made a claim, it was accepted she was entitled to over pound per week and shemade a back-payment of over pound,ndash A woman notied DWP of her post-retirement orce in  but no action was taken. As recently as , she was told her pension was correct. She has now had an increase in her pension of over pound per week plus arrears of pound,ndash And another retiree who orced post-retirement who has received arrears of pound, plus a large pension increase, Sir Steve said.He said: ldquoA series of inidual cases has highlighted blunders which have led to orced women being underpaid by tens of thousands of pounds, in some cases for a decade or more.ldquoThe Department has dismissed concerns around this group far too lightly and should take another look to assess the scale of the problem and then take action to put things right.Sir Steve said copies of the letter had also been sent to the chairs of the Work and Pensions Committee and the Public Accounts Committee, as well as to the head of the National Audit Office.A DWP spokesperson said: ldquoWe encourage people to contact usthey get orced or their civil partnership is dissolved and every year we remind people about doing so alongside the uprating notications we send out.ldquoWe want everyone to claim the benefits to which they may be entitled and we urge anyone of state pension age ndash or their family and friends ndash to checkthey are missing out on financial support.ldquoWe apologise for the errors in the cases identied and have corrected our records and paid the arrears owed.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Last night was the first night.”“I went down on Monday and there was no mention of it. You used to get a  per cent discount.”He added: “I was totally surprised. I only booked my ticket a week or so ago. I wasn’t advised, and it doesn’t seem astheir crew was advised – I did query it with them.”Serco NorthLink’s commercial director Jim Dow said: “We are proud to offer an extensive food and drink menu on board that is very reasonably priced and equal for all passengers.“Our commitment to working with local suppliers continues and we are proud to showcase those partnerships. “While the Islander discount code is no longer in place, all passengers do have access to a iety of choices and price points.”A classic example of where profits are more important than the service Serco gives. Despite it being a leline service, Serco obviously see#s this as an oppertunity to profit from this by penalising islanders regardless. I would suggest people take onboard a lunch box, which would probably be cheaper, on their next trip down south. ...Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

He has lived in Shetland since , where he harbours an unhealthy interest in old cars and motorbikes.NorthLink#s freight sailings have been cancelled, the ferry operator has advised.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4285900.jpg--.jpg?1638548013000\n","title":"ballymena soprano catrina launches classical celtic christmas album","story":"BALLYMENA Soprano, Catrina Scullion, is launching her new album, “Classical Celtic Christmas”, in St Marys Church, Haddington Road, Dublin, tonight at pm.For those who cannot attend, the event will be broadcast virtually from the church.To watch this event please visit https:www.stmaryshaddingtonroad.ie Popular songs will include O Holy Night and Silent Night.Catrinas CD will be available in the Repository at All Saints Church, Ballymena, for pound, with proceeds being donated to St Vincent DePaul.It is hoped the local community in Ballymena will tune in and support Catrina.The Ballymenachatted to Catrina this week.

It was claimed the instruction had been issued because “the law was not clear”. It was reported that police will not ask people to wear a face mask as they could be exempt. They [police officers] have been specically told not to get into that territory,” it was reported.The PSNI said officers took an “engage, explain and encourage” approach.Read MoreFive Northern Ireland people fined for not wearing face maskA law was introduced in August last year making it mandatory for people to wear face masks in a iety of settings in a bid to reduce the spread of Covid-.Last week, the Belfastreported five people had been fined £ for not wearing a face mask.SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, a member of the Stormont health committee, said the threat posed by the new Omicron iant, which is believed to be more transmissible than the Delta iant, means it is even more important every step is taken to protect the public from the virus.“Social distancing, wearing masks, using hand sanitiser, they will all help to break the transmission of this virus so they really can’t be ignored,” he said.“The problem is that people are becoming more complacent, the pandemic has been going for such a long time, and people are forgetting about the basic steps that keep us safe.“I really believe thatthe police were handing out fines more regularly it would sharpen the mind and people would be less likely not to forget or just decide not to wear face coverings.”Last Tuesday,  people were fined by London Transport in one day for not wearing a face mask and  people were asked to get off buses and trains because they were not wearing one.A PSNI spokesman said: “The policing approach to the wearing of face-coverings, as with other Health Protection Regulations, has been to engage, explain and encourage people to adhere to the regulations and only enforce where necessary. Given that most people when approached by police officers will voluntarily comply with their requests, the amount of enforcement required in respect of face-coverings and therefore the number of FPNs issues will tend to be low.“We will continue to encourage people to follow the regulations and wear a face covering when required unless they have a medical reason for not doing so.We will continue to work with business owners and transport operators across Northern Ireland in a partnership approach and also ask for the co-operation from the public to help us all keep people safe.The Department for Infrastructure and Translink were asked by the BBC how many fines had been handed out on public transport.

The term fracking refers to how the rock is fractured apart by the high-pressure mixture.The process uses huge amounts of water, which has to be transported to the site, and environmentalists said potentially carcinogenic chemicals may escape during drilling.

Activists said the new policy will allow fracking applications that are currently stalled to go ahead in several areas of Northern Ireland. Instead, the Executive should ban petroleum licencing completely and put an end to fracking.Mr Ruffalo said in a tweet: “Sinn Fein can protect the island of Ireland#s water, air, land and public health and lead the way on green, clean renewable energy by banning fracking now with a policy to end petroleum licenses in Northern Ireland.”Oisin Coghlan, Director of Friends of the Earth Ireland said England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland all have moratoriums or bans on fracking - Northern Ireland needs to be next.“Before the Dail election last year, the Sinn Fein manesto could not have been clearer, promising ‘A total ban on fracking across the island of Ireland, including exploratory drilling.’ But they have been conspicuously silent on the proposed licencing policy being prepared by the DUP that would pave the way for fracking in Northern Ireland, he said.“Sinn Fein has the power to give anti-fracking campaigners the reassurance they need after the Alliance Party and UUP confirmed they would vote against any petroleum licencing policy”, Mr Coghlan added.James Orr from Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland said: For  years, communities in the North have dealt with the stress and anxiety of having fracking hanging over us. We know from the nearly  scientic studies and reports done around the world on fracking that it poisons the water, air and land and harms public health. We have to stop this now.”In response, a spokesperson for Sinn Fein said the party is opposed to the approval of any petroleum licences and will continue to oppose any attempts to explore, drill or extract petroleum here.“Sinn Fein is currently progressing a bill in the Assembly to ban fracking. The aim of this bill is to ban all fracking in the north and realise a ban on fracking across the island. Sinn Fein is the only party bringing forward legislation to ban fracking.“Sinn Fein sought to include a ban on offshore fracking but this is a British government reserved matter and not within the competence of the Assembly.

This bill represented an attack on the rural way of le and was riddled with dangerous proposals.Our full statement ⬇️ pic unhlpat— Countryside AllianceDecember , Chairman of the Stormont Agriculture Committee, Declan McAleer, earlier said the committee has not yet agreed a stance on the Bill.He had said his partydoes not agree with a ban on hunting, but that there are elements of the Bill which it does agree with.“Legislation as it currently stands we feel is unworkable and would require signicant additional time in the committee to recty it, and that’s time we currently don’t have, given the challenges of other legislation such as both of the climate change bills,” Mr McAleer said earlier.“I have no doubt that this issue will be revisited in the next mandate when appropriate time can be set aside to examine the issue in a round and to work alongside stakeholders to see what legislative changes are needed,any.”DUP MLA William Irwin had opposed the Bill, describing it as “bad legislation”.He said he had received “hundreds of pieces of correspondence from people who are deeply concerned by this poorly thought-out bill”.[ ] The USPCA is very disappointed with the outcome of the debate on the Hunting Bill in the Assembly this afternoon. This result is contrary to the views of the public as outlined in the consultation response and in previous public opinion polls. @JohnBlairMLA— USPCA OfficialDecember , “Practically every dog owner in the country whose dog may at some point chase a wild animal could indeed be committing an offencethis poorly thought out and ill-advised law were actually to come into force,” he told MLAs.He had warned that the Bill would create an “absolute legislative nightmare” and a “signicant resource implication for the PSNI”.Speaking ahead of the debate, Stormont Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots indicated he would not be supporting the Bill.Mr Poots contended foxes are a threat to some ground-nesting birds such as red grouse and hen harriers.“If we’re serious about bioersity, then we need to have management tools and we need to be very cautious about removing management tools,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.“I’m not sure it is a particularly well-written Bill so I can’t support it on that basis.“Personally I don’t hunt, I don’t particularly like hunting, but I can’t support this particular Bill because I think that it isn’t well thought through. It might be well meaning but not well thought through, and has damaging consequencesit came into force.”Hunting with dogs has been banned in England, Scotland, and Wales since the early s.The Bill gained signicant support during a public consultation with nearly % of the , respondents in favour of a ban.It is understood to be the largest consultation response in Stormont’s history.Northern Ireland animal welfare charity USPCA, said it was disappointed with the vote.Chief executive Brendan Mullan said the result was “contrary to the views of the public”.“Hunting wild mammals with dogs is sadistic and cruel and has no place in an advanced and compassionate society.“We are staggered that half of our political representatives do not hold this view and encourage members of the public to reflect on whether their views have been appropriately represented on this issue,” he said.But Gary McCartney, director of Countryside Alliance Ireland, welcomed the result.“We have been clear from the start that today’s bill was anti-rural and dangerous.“Mr Blair’s bill was clumsily drafted and riddled with proposals which,implemented, would not only potentially criminalise every dog owner in Northern Ireland but also represent an attack on the rural way of le.”Most ReadBankrupt star Mark Allen snookered by £k tax bill‘I’d give anything to have you back’: mum posts emotional tribute to tragic Tierna Campbell found dead in BallynahinchFAI only ever interested in nationalist players, says ex-NI boss O’NeillBBC’s Emma Vardy inundated with well-wishes following engagement to partner Aaron AdamsSmirking paedophile priest turns his grubby hands to perverted literatureTop VideosPlayFountain proposal goes horribly wrongPlayWatch: Storm Barra predicted route across UK and Ireland from Met OfficePlayJamie Dornan stars innew thriller on BBC -The TouristLatest Northern Ireland‘No plans’ to close NI schools early for ChristmasCo Fermanagh community ‘rocked’ by multiple stabbingsSome schools set to close as Ireland braces for Storm BarraWounded veteran completes London to Belfast fundraiser walkTaoiseach and Tanaiste mark th anniversary of signing of Anglo-Irish TreatyLatestBob Dole to lie in state at Capitol as nation honours senatorFA Cup holders Leicester to face Watford in third round‘No plans’ to close NI schools early for ChristmasDan Walker: Last Strictly performance was the best I’ve danced in my entire leHomes cut off by Storm Arwen to be reconnected by tomorrow, PM says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You could probably multiply that apprehensiveness by a factor of  for Co Down couple David and Fiona Boyd-Armstrong when, seven years ago, they took a deep breath and sent Northern Ireland’s first artisan gin out into the shops.Shortcross hit the shelves in , blazing a trail for a new wave of small spirit distillers and adding a new dimension to what was then Northern Ireland’s fledgling food and drink renaissance. Today it’s a familiar and trusted brand with a loyal fan base. But don’t think any of that came easily.Shortly before they married in , David and Fiona went on a wine tour in France, made some valuable contacts, and mulled over the idea of their own drinks business as they planned a future together. “In an ideal world we’d have started our own vineyard,” admits David. “But hey, we live in Co Down.”So instead they turned to gin. At the time, craft gin just wasn’t on the radar at all here. No one  was making it and the vast majority of drinkers had a limited choice of Gordon’s or maybe Cork Dry or Gilbey’s. In these days of bars with eye-popping gin menus stretching to hundreds of brands, it’s hard to appreciate just how audacious the Boyd-Armstrongs’ decision was.David and Fiona spent every weekend and every holiday doing research and visiting distilleries across the globe from Seattle to Seoul. They found inspiration in the legion of micro-producers dotted across America and took heart from the buying policy of one of the bigger bars in Seattle, which stocked nothing but small-scale, locally-produced drinks.The couple ordered their first still in , installed it at Rademon — the Crossgar estate owned by Fiona’s family — and spent the summer and autumn of that year developing and fine-tuning their recipe. They wanted to do everything themselves. “There was no bottling plant available to us so we had to learn how to bottle,” says Fiona. “We had to become experts in every part of the process.”After the launch in , they found they still had another part of the process to learn. Producing a new gin was only half the battle — the other half was trying to convince gin drinkers to forego their Gordon’s or their Cork Dry and try Shortcross instead. “It was like climbing a mountain,” Fiona confesses.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Introducing anything new is always going to be challenging — for example, it took us three years to get Shortcross into airport shops,” she says. “Really it’s all about changing perceptions. We found that people get more interested in your gin when you break it down for them and explain the components and how they come together.”It took years of hard work and resolve to make Shortcross the success it is today. With a larger still, a team of around  people and an expanding range that includes a cask-aged gin and the highly successful Rosie’s Garden pink gin, it must have been tempting for the Boyd-Armstrongs just to keep on doing what they’re doing.But all the time, in the background, there was another project that fascinated them.Just a couple of years after the first gin was launched, David and Fiona began distilling whiskey. And just like in the gin process, they wanted to do everything themselves. David had grown up in east Belfast, in the shadow of buildings that once housed the famous old whiskey distilleries of Avoniel and Connswater, and long before they starting making whiskey themselves, Fiona had become fascinated by the story of Ulster’s lost distilleries, so perhaps the seed of an idea had been quietly germinating for many years before it finally became a reality.Once they had produced a raw spirit from malted barley on a small -litre still, they decided they wanted to do something dferent with it. Whiskey often begins its slow process of maturation in American oak barrels, sometimes ones that have previously held bourbon, and is then finished in something like old sherry casks. But the Boyd-Armstrongs opted to do things the other way round. In March  they obtained two Grand Cru Classe Bordeaux wine casks, filled them with their newly-made spirit and put them away to quietly mature.“The casks you use really have to match the spirit you distil,” says David. “There’s a degree of black magic in deciding what you want to use and theof time the whiskey spends in each one.”After the Bordeaux casks had weaved their black magic spell, the whiskey was finished in barrels made from virgin American oak. The Boyd-Armstrongs could have bottled and sold the whiskey after three years but instead let it sit for two more. “We found it just kept getting better and better,” says David. “Finishing it in the American oak casks brought a sweetness and a nuttiness to it.”The finished whiskey finally made it into slightly fewer than  bottles just last month and when David and Fiona spoke to me they were still waiting for the labels to arrive.“In commercial terms it’s one of the smallest batches of whiskey you’ll find anywhere,” says David. But he also proudly points out it’s the first new whiskey to be wholly produced by a Northern Ireland distillery outside of Old Bushmills since the s.Just like their gin, Shortcross whiskey is a product made entirely on site to unique specications and then launched into a market where there are big players galore.

the business case for the scheme but we’re unable to confirm that it offered value for money.“However, because I believed that it would give that much-needed boost, and combined private and public

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

A Christmas adventure set in Derry is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Once upon a time, what started as a bedtime story could become a Christmas best-seller. googletag.cmd.push Derry-based writer, Robert Campbell, has released a new childrens novel, “Sled Down!” where four animal schoolchildren from Culmore venture into the city to save Christmas. The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

Almost two-thirdsof internet users aged  to  years refused use of their personal data for advertising purposes, compared with % of persons in the  to  years age group Only % of people said they read a website’s privacy policy statement before providing personal information online.  Ms Delamere said: “As our internet usage continues to increase, so too does the amount of personal information and data which is made available online. “In , almost six in internet users restricted access to their geographical location when using online s, while nearly six in internet users refused allowing the use of personal data for advertising purposes. “Internet users were less likely, however, to limit access to their profile or content on social networking sites or shared online storage, with just under halfof internet users limiting such access.” She added: “Websites that collect personal information require a privacy policy statement, but only % of internet users read them before providing personal information online. “Similarly, even though everyone has the right to access the digital personal data collected by websites or search engines administrator or providers, just % of internet users requested access to their online personal data to update or delete it.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The National Archiveswill present an exhibition thatmarks itsrole as the official repository of the recordsof the State, one hundred years since its formation. The Treaty, : Records fromthe Archivesopens up signicant historical records, official documents, and private papers for the first time, includingthe first public presentation of both the Irish and British copies of the Treaty document. The exhibition locatesthe Treaty negotiations in the political context of the Irish revolution beginning with the exploratorytalks betweenEacuteamon de Valera and David Lloyd George during the summer of , itdetailsthe work of the Irish plenipotentiaries and their secretariat, by presenting the documentary record that they left behind.  The exhibition also chronicles day-to-day le in London for the men and women who made up the Irish delegation, from parties attended,dinners hosted and appearances at theatre and gala performances, to the tense final days and hours leading to the signing of the Treaty just after am on  December . Finally, it documents the delegation’sto Dublin, and the Daacuteil Eacuteireann cabinetmeeting that pointed to the split in the independence movement that emerged over the terms of the Treaty, and the isions that wouldlead to Civil War. Speaking at the exhibition, Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said thisis a signicant exhibition bringing key records relating to the foundation of the State to the public for the first time in  years. These records highlight this complex period in our history culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . They present the dficult political context in which the Treaty was negotiated but they also open a window for the first time into the world in which the Irish delegation operated during their time in London. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to attend this exhibition. he added. Taacutenaiste Leo Varadkar said the Treaty was a decisive moment in history, an agreement negotiated in good faith between two opposing sides. This exhibition provides a vital connection to the foundation of our State, reminding us of the dramatic events of one hundred years ago, and the courageous decisions which enabled us to achieve a priceless stepping stone to freedom. he added. The National Archives wasestablished to collect, manage and preserve Ireland’s public record, ensuring their availability as a resource for all. These records relate to the social, cultural, economic and political history of the island of Ireland from the Middle Ages through to the establishment of the Irish Free State in  and into the modern era. Admission to the exhibition is free. Book online at here. This exhibition is presented as part of the Government of Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries - National Programme. It runs from December ,  - March ,  from am-pm daily.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

The exhibition also chronicles day-to-day le in London for the men and women who made up the Irish delegation, from parties attended,dinners hosted and appearances at theatre and gala performances, to the tense final days and hours leading to the signing of the Treaty just after am on  December . Finally, it documents the delegation’sto Dublin, and the Daacuteil Eacuteireann cabinetmeeting that pointed to the split in the independence movement that emerged over the terms of the Treaty, and the isions that wouldlead to Civil War. Speaking at the exhibition, Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said thisis a signicant exhibition bringing key records relating to the foundation of the State to the public for the first time in  years. These records highlight this complex period in our history culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . They present the dficult political context in which the Treaty was negotiated but they also open a window for the first time into the world in which the Irish delegation operated during their time in London. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to attend this exhibition. he added. Taacutenaiste Leo Varadkar said the Treaty was a decisive moment in history, an agreement negotiated in good faith between two opposing sides. This exhibition provides a vital connection to the foundation of our State, reminding us of the dramatic events of one hundred years ago, and the courageous decisions which enabled us to achieve a priceless stepping stone to freedom. he added. The National Archives wasestablished to collect, manage and preserve Ireland’s public record, ensuring their availability as a resource for all. These records relate to the social, cultural, economic and political history of the island of Ireland from the Middle Ages through to the establishment of the Irish Free State in  and into the modern era. Admission to the exhibition is free. Book online at here. This exhibition is presented as part of the Government of Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries - National Programme. It runs from December ,  - March ,  from am-pm daily.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Status Red Weather Warnings issued for parts of Ireland as Storm Barra bears down on IrelandWeatherStorm Barra best avoided as forecaster issues enhanced warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Boundary Commissions final recommendations for the Irish border.

Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Steelstown - Donaghmoyne -                                  googletag.cmd.push  Steelstown overcame a three-point half-time deficit to race to a -point victory in their Ulster Championship quarter-final tie against Donaghmoyne at Celtic Park. Hugh McGrath’s team produced an emphatic second half performance to stun their Monaghan opponents just when it seemed that they were in trouble after a dficult first period. The first half started extremely well for Brian Ogs who replied to Davy Garland’s point by putting the ball in the net with their first attack, Eoghan Bradley hammering in from close range after good work by Gareth Logue. But Donaghmoyne responded strongly with two goals of their own in the space of seven minutes. Ronan McDonald got the better of Kevin Lindsay before firing through Eoghan Heraghty’s legs, and Liam McDonald then fired home from the penalty spot after Eoghan Concannon had fouled Davy Garland. Steelstown were too reckless with their shooting, five unforced wides, and they went  minutes without scoring as Donaghamoyne took control – McDonald and Garland scoring to put four points between them as half time approached. McCarron’s score on  minutes took it down to -, - with Steelstown needing a signicant improvement in the second half. The game was turned on its head completely as two goals in the first seven minutes contributed to a seven-point swing in the scoreline. Both goals came from Cahir McMonagle, scoring just seconds after throw-in before finding the net a second time after picking up a loose shot from Ben McCarron. Further scores from Oran McManamin, Oran Fox and McMonagle sent Steelstown -,  clear before Garland hit back after an -minute drought for Donaghmoyne. Steelstown’s lead increased when Niall Meegan hauled down Diarmuid Baker, and Ben McCarron slotted in from the penalty spot. Morgan Murray came off the bench to score two points and Donncha Gilmore had the last say as Steelstown cruised to victory.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Steelstown - Donaghmoyne -                                  googletag.cmd.push  Steelstown overcame a three-point half-time deficit to race to a -point victory in their Ulster Championship quarter-final tie against Donaghmoyne at Celtic Park. Hugh McGrath’s team produced an emphatic second half performance to stun their Monaghan opponents just when it seemed that they were in trouble after a dficult first period. The first half started extremely well for Brian Ogs who replied to Davy Garland’s point by putting the ball in the net with their first attack, Eoghan Bradley hammering in from close range after good work by Gareth Logue. But Donaghmoyne responded strongly with two goals of their own in the space of seven minutes. Ronan McDonald got the better of Kevin Lindsay before firing through Eoghan Heraghty’s legs, and Liam McDonald then fired home from the penalty spot after Eoghan Concannon had fouled Davy Garland. Steelstown were too reckless with their shooting, five unforced wides, and they went  minutes without scoring as Donaghamoyne took control – McDonald and Garland scoring to put four points between them as half time approached. McCarron’s score on  minutes took it down to -, - with Steelstown needing a signicant improvement in the second half. The game was turned on its head completely as two goals in the first seven minutes contributed to a seven-point swing in the scoreline. Both goals came from Cahir McMonagle, scoring just seconds after throw-in before finding the net a second time after picking up a loose shot from Ben McCarron. Further scores from Oran McManamin, Oran Fox and McMonagle sent Steelstown -,  clear before Garland hit back after an -minute drought for Donaghmoyne. Steelstown’s lead increased when Niall Meegan hauled down Diarmuid Baker, and Ben McCarron slotted in from the penalty spot. Morgan Murray came off the bench to score two points and Donncha Gilmore had the last say as Steelstown cruised to victory.

Spring: Sunday, The Horror Channel @ pm A disastrous personal le has Evan in a tizzy so he does a legger from the United States to Italy and its here he meets an unusual woman called Louise and a dalliance with her makes his existence back in America look rather normal. A film you want to watch knowing as little about it as possible. Its fun, atmospheric and it will lurk in your head for a while. The fact that its on the horror channel will clue you in. Lou Taylor Pucci andNadia Hilker work well together. Last Orders: Sunday, Film @ pm Jack has passed away and his friends are in mourning. He went out with a smile and one final wish - that his friends get together once more to reminisce and scatter his ashes over the beach he loved so well. An elegant, touching and humane look at the pleasures and hardships of lelong friendships told wonderfully by director Fred Schepisi and a stunner of a cast that includes Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Ray Winston, Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay. Brighton Rock: Monday, Talking PicturesTV@ pm Pinkys the leader of a gang in pre-war Brighton. Hes a nasty piece of work and a run-in with a journalist causes big problems for him and for a naive young waitress named Rose whos witness to what he has done. This  adaption of Graham Greens celebrated novel is still a tense, nerve wracking and affecting watch  years later. A baby faced Richard Attenborough does memorable work in the lead role. Topsy Turvy: Monday, Film @ .pm Gilbert and Sullivan. A partnership for the ages. The men behind so many famous operas of the th century. Their work didnt always come easy to them though and Topsy Turvy gives us a peek behind their stage curtains. Mike Leighs  musical drama might be almost  hours long but its very entertaining and satisfying and in the company of actors like Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, Lesley Manville and Shirley Henderson the time flies Farming: Tuesday, Channel  @ .am A young Nigerian boy is sent by his family to England in the s to be raised in a white household. It was a practice known as farming, an attempt to give poor African children a better chance at le. It left some of them with a very confused look at their own racial identity. Based on directorAdewale Akinnuoye-Agbajes own le, its a raw and disturbing coming of age story and a damning indictment of the British governments warped policies. Damson Idris is an excellent lead. Tully: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Marlos struggling. Three kids are taking their toll on her and her marriage. A nanny is hired. An unusual nanny named Tully. A strange bond forms between the two women. Tully comes from the pen of Diablo Cody so its no surprise that it delves into myriad aspects of womanhood rarely seen on screen and that paired with fine turns from Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis makes it really worth a watch Catch And Release: Wednesday, Great! Movies @ .am On the day she was supposed to get married Gray finds herself at the funeral of the man she loved. She has no money and nowhere to live and has to move in with his room mates and soon finds out she didnt know him as well as she thought. This  romcom is enjoyableyou can zone out Kevin Smith as one of the room mates. Jenner Garner and Timothy Olyphant do good enough work together to help you ignore the eejit in the corner. Free State Of Jones: Wednesday, BBC two @ .pm Alienated by the confederation, a soldier deserts his post during the American civil war and together with farmers and freed slaves creates a new state. Things do not go smoothly. Gary Rosss  film is a vivid recreation of an era of American history that rarely gets mentioned. Its as brutal and ugly as youd expect but superb acting from Matthew McConnaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw  Mahershala Ali eases the pain. Another Year: Thursday, Channel  @ am Gerri and Tom are living a quiet, contented le and looking forward to the freedom that comes with retirement but their orced and unhappy friend Mary is becoming an increasingly large presence in their lives. The second Mike Leigh film of the week is too no big surprise another cracker, a deep e into the minutiae of everyday lives and loves that doesnt need fake drama to make its point. Ruth Sheen, Jim Broadbent and Lesley Manville are all impeccable. The Manchurian Candidate: Thursday, BBC @ pm Prisoners of warfrom capture in the Korean War to America. But all is not well. To say anymore might spoil a magnicent piece of neo-noir. A truly suspenseful film, intelligent, inventive, paranoid, complex and deeply layered. Fabulous acting abounds. Frank Sinatra gives one of his best performances but the star of the show is Angela Lansbury. Her character is quite the creation, you wont be able to look away from her. Lawman: Friday, TG @ .pm A marshal arrives into a town to arrest the troublemakers who caused the death of an old man in his town. The townsfolk arent going to make things easy for him though. A hoary old revenge story is the basis of this blistering western and its one that effortlessly bridges the gap between the old fashioned westerns of the s and the dark and violent ones of the s. Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan and Robert Duvall, all old hands at this genre, are all in fine form here. Wild Nights With Emily: Friday, Film @ .pm Not much is known about the personal le of Emily Dickinson, the th century American poet. She was long considered an eccentric loner by her neighbours inMassachusetts but Madeleine Olneks  romcom tells us a dferent version of her story. A surprisingly touching and warm look at how secrets are kept and how legends are created powered by strong turns from Molly Shannon, Amy Seimetz and Susan Zeigler. The Leisure Seeker: Friday RTEacute One @ .pm The Leisure Seeker is the name of Ella and Johns RV and it becomes their home when they decide to drive from Boston to Key West in an attempt to revisit older, better times. A poignant watch that doesnt skimp on the realities of growing old while at the same time shows us a type of love and understanding that only exists after decades of being together. Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland work very well together as the leads.

Those behind the initiative have a long-term focus on addressing the pressing need for the transformation of our high streets.ldquoThe welcome initiative provides an important opportunity for everyone to have their say and influence the vision that will be required to breathe new le into high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area which will be crucial in a post-Covid world.Cllr Curran added: ldquoSadly, many of our businesses have borne the brunt of the pandemic and anything that can be done to help them and increase footfall in our town and villages is particularly welcome. The visit of the task force team is an opportunity that must be grasped with both hands.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Chris cranks up Christmas fun  ","story":"TURKEYS, toys, nostalgia and noise are on the menu which will be served up on the Chris Scott Show on FM Down Community Radio tonight.Join Chris from -pm as he chats with Killyleagh butcher Alfie Murray, who talks about the le of a turkey in the run-up to Christmas mdash and also suggests a few good cooking tips.Chris then goes to Newcastle where he pops into Thumbelina, a traditional toy shop, and meets with its proprietor, Audrey Byrne.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too. Jamie Ferguson and Matthew Nelson also battled hard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Dunleath parkrun plans edging

the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos understood that the area earmarked for the proposed pump track, skateboard track and play park sit outside the parkrsquos floodplain and will enable the local authority to move faster in putting a business case together and progress towards securing capital funding.The need for new G or G pitches mdash which can be used all year round mdash at Dunleath Park also been highlighted with council

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11871960.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Top left is the M towards Antrim, top right M bridge to Bangor, and bottom is WestlinkIt was written by the roads expert Wesley Johnston . The online version of this article links to it, see below.Wesley is an astute analyst of roads infrastructure, and he runs a website devoted to Northern Ireland’s highways - both those that have been built in recent years, those that are being built, and those that are planned.My heart sank when I read Wesley’s analsysis of the proposals to join three of NI’s busiest routes - the M, the Westlink M, and the M bridge - in a seamless interchange that will remove all traffic lights and all obstacles.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.He concluded that the scheme was now unlikely to proceed in its current form.I have had concerns about this vital project for many years, given the delays and reviews.Only last month a Belfast City Council committee voted to withdraw its support from the plans.Stormont’s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon of the SDLP, has seemed, as Wesley put it, “lukewarm about York Street Interchange from the outset”.One of her predecessors, Sinn Fein’s Chris Hazzard, wanted to emphasise projects west of the Bann, such as the A.It seems that some politicians in the Alliance Party have turned against the York Street plan too.There are a number of reasons for the new coolness towards the interchange, including the growing interest in environmental matters and the changes to lestyle and travel patterns caused by Cocid.I wonderin some quarters there is an extra layer of hostility to the £ million project because the DUP secured funding for it as part of its agreement to sustain the Conservative Party in power in . This would be a disappointing outlookso, because the DUP was rightly praised for seeking financial support that would benefit the whole community, rather than just unionists, when it struck a deal with Theresa May after the general election of that year.There are some dubious ideas that are emerging now about road projects.The first is that it is automatically a good thing to constrain vehicle traffic in order to make way for cyclists and pedestrians and buses.It is indeed a good idea to do that in many contexts, particularly in urban areas. But often such changes help people who are young and able bodied and who live in densely populated areas.They do not help, say, a single mother in the suburbs who has to take her children to school in one direction in the rain, then travel in the other to a job in which it is not possible to work from home.It does not help an elderly person who lives in a rural area who depends on a car for their mobility and whose home is located in such a sparsely populated location that there is no prospect, ever of regular public transport services.In other words, it is not necessarily a selfish thing to want to run a car, as some of the more hardcore environmental scolds imply.In fact cars are one of the greatest advances in human history and have enabled people around the world to live much more liberated lives than they did only decades ago, when poorer people were unable to afford to travel far from their home.Covid has caused changes in lestyle pattern changes that should be welcomed, such as the increased flexibility caused by many people working from home. This will reduce rush hour congestion and will enable people to live far further from their work places and so should lead to a more even spread in property prices between town and country.Yet we have also seen that the desire that people have to use their car has — inevitably — come roaring back. Therefore we need to focus on making cars more environmentally efficient, and to make roads better too.The first part of that equation was happening anyway. When I was born in the US in the s, cars were grossly inefficient because petrol was so cheap. Now cars get two or three times more miles to the gallon than they did. Electric cars and other innovations will make this even better.But good, freeflowing trunk roads are an environmental boost too.In fact they can go in tandem with restrictions to traffic in towns and cities.I think we need more mph limits in urban areas, perhaps enforced by speed cameras, but more so-called expresswayswith mph limits to get between towns.The York St junction is a key example of this. We do not want traffic that is going from Stormont to West Belfast to crawl through city streets. We want it to travel on a ring road so that we can make those city streets more friendly to local and slower traffic.Not only should York St be built, we should be planing a free flowing junction at Tillysburn too and indeed a freer flowing outer ring road, ideally all the way round past Forestside and out towards the M near Lisburn, where traffic can then rejoin the ‘ring road’ back towards Belfast and the Westlink.Ms Mallon’s review of York Street which was completed this year recommended that the project think more broadly about its impacts on the local area. But the immediate vicinity of the road has been a noisy, congested junction for decades and will never cease to be so. The interchange would have made it easier to cross from the city centre to north Belfast by foot or bicycle by separating such traffic from the junction.As to the A, it too should be built, because such roads are far safer than single carriageways.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

It is our job to question and to debate and to argue issues out, and given the fundamentally dferent nature of this proposal from that which went before in terms of combating the threat of Covid-, a threat that we all recognise, a threat that we all want to see tackled, I think it is essential that we, the members of this Assembly, whether we’re for them or against them, we should be allowed the opportunity to debate this out and to have the arguments thrashed out here on the floor of the House.“I recognise that the Minister for Health has a very dficult job, and is facing a very dficult time over the coming months, but it is our job to support the minister when he is right but also to question, and to debate and to tease out the evidence, and that’s why I am very disappointed that I don’t see any reference in the business diary to such a debate taking place. It absolutely should take place.”A department of health spokesperson said: “The regulations are currently being scrutinised by the Examiner for Statutory Rules. We await her report.“The regulations are scheduled for debate in the Assembly on December .”The death of one further patient who had previously tested positive for Covid- and a further , cases of the virus were notied in Northern Ireland on Monday.On Monday morning there were  Covid-positive patients in hospital, of whom  were in intensive care.Covid-Christopher StalfordThe CovidDUP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularPSNI call for common sense as car spotted taking up four parking spacesBen Lowry: It is a great pity to see plans for a York St road flyover junction in Belfast slipping awayIRA murderers should get the death penalty: DUP MPOwen Polley: The volume of propaganda in favour of the Northern Ireland Protocol is increasing The Orange Order has got unionism to unite against the Northern Ireland ProtocolMost PopularAldi releases two festive gin liqueurs for Christmas, including a Spiced Biscuit flavour - how to buyBest SAD lamps: How a sun lamp can help you through winter, and the best from Amazon, Beurer and LumiePremier League Winter Ball  : cost and where to buy new Nike football - from Sports Direct to JD SportsBest pramsuits for your baby : from Jo Jo Maman Bebe, Marks and Spencer and JoulesMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale now                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
