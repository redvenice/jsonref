Find the Titanic? That\u0027s crazy!”’Thunman agreed to fund the Titanic expedition on one condition - that Ballard use the money and the time to also locate two nuclear submarines that went missing in the Atlantic in the 1960s.          The Titanic was the luxury ocean liner which tragically sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean after colliding into an iceberg on April 15, 1912On April 10, 1963, the USS Thresher sank during deep-ing tests more than 200 miles off the coast of Boston.

One of them, the USS Thresher, is seen in the above file photo  In 1968, 99 crewmen died when their submarine, the USS Scorpion, mysteriously disappeared near the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago some 1,000 miles west of the European continent. The Scorpion is seen above in Portsmouth, England on May 10, 1960Ballard said he needed the Titanic story as subterfuge.‘It was very top secret,’ Ballard said.‘And so I said, “Well, let\u0027s tell the world I am going after the Titanic”.’Ballard managed to find the Thresher and the Scorpion, but it took him longer than expected.So he only had 12 days left to search for the ruins of the Titanic.‘I learned something from mapping the Scorpion that taught me how to find the Titanic: look for its trail of debris,’ Ballard said.It took him eight days to locate the ship, whereas others searched for nearly two months and didn’t find it, Ballard said.In the final four days before his mission was up, Ballard did underwater filming of the Titanic’s wreckage.          Of the estimated 2,400 who sailed on the Titanic when it left port at Southampton for New York City, more than 1,500 died. The remnants of the Titanic are seen above on the floor of the North Atlantic OceanHe said that his team’s mood changed quickly as it got closer to the wreckage site.‘We realized we were dancing on someone\u0027s grave, and we were embarrassed,’ Ballard said.‘The mood, it was like someone took a wall switch and went click.‘And we became sober, calm, respectful, and we made a promise to never take anything from that ship, and to treat it with great respect.‘You don\u0027t go to Gettysburg with a shovel. You don\u0027t take belt buckles off the Arizona.’Of the estimated 2,400 who sailed on the Titanic when it left port at Southampton for New York City, more than 1,500 died.The ocean liner is the subject of a new exhibit, Titanic: The Untold Story, at National Geographic Museum in Washington, D.C. Titanic: The untold story - A National Geographic Museum exhibit tells the previously-classified tale behind its discovery - CBS News"},{"url":null,"title":"Question Time tweeted BBC shows 2018","story":"    News and current affairs programmes dominated the list of the most tweeted about BBC shows, with Question Time coming top (file photo)          The Andrew Marr Show was in second place.

The key thing is to have someone at your side that understands you, has known you a long time, likes you and commands your respect - and you know I\u0027m vicious, tough and brilliant - as you yourself saidWhen you made me your first Celebrity Apprentice a decade ago, you told me in the live NBC finale: ‘Piers, you’re a vicious guy. I’ve seen it. You’re tough. You’re smart. You’re probably brilliant, I’m not sure. You’re certainly not diplomatic. But you did an amazing job and you beat the hell out of everybody - you’re my Celebrity Apprentice.’Let’s be honest, what more could you possibly want from your Chief of Staff? You could have been talking about yourself!Let’s also be honest about something else: nobody else is exactly storming the ramparts of the White House demanding you hire them for the toughest job in world politics.Yesterday, it was reported that your first choice, the vice president’s CoS Nick Ayers, turned down the job despite it being an obvious step up.  You need someone who will staff the Oval Office with loyal workers, not reptiles like Omarosa Manigault. And I get on with Ivanka and Jared, and would encourage you to listen to them as much as possible.  I see them as a great asset and two very smart young people5) You need a CoS who gets on with Ivanka and Jared, and encourages you to listen to them as much as possible. I do, because I see them as a great asset to you, not a hindrance. They’re two very smart young people with independent minds who you know you can trust and who aren’t afraid to give you their honest opinions even if they know you don’t want to hear them. These are the best kind of advisors.6) You need to stop your silly war with CNN. I know some of my former colleagues have become annoyingly (and in my view, unfairly) partisan against you, and that bashing them goes down well with your base. But it’s such a waste of time and energy, and constantly calling them ‘enemy of the people’ is downright dangerous. CNN has received bombs and death threats. This feud is not a joke now, it’s deadly serious. I know how the media works better than anyone you’ve had around you. Trust me when I tell you this is a war you no longer need to wage.7) As Obama’s former CoS, Rahm Emmanuel, said this week, you need a ‘true wartime consigliere’ like Robert Duvall’s character Tom Hagen in The Godfather. Things are about to get ferociously nasty as Robert Mueller prepares his report into all things Russia. You don’t want a CoS who’s not up for a scrap. As I think my Twitter feed suggests, I love a scrap.          Use Melania more. She’s become a very popular electoral asset, who has barely put a foot wrong since becoming First Lady - and I get along very well with her8) Use Melania more. She’s become a very popular electoral asset, who has barely put a foot wrong since becoming First Lady, despite all the awful lurid scandals and gossip she’s had to endure. As you know, I get on very well with Melania, and think she’s a tough, fearless, highly impressive lady. You need a CoS who knows this and persuades you to deploy her more.

We need to kick racism out of football,’ wrote Mr Norris.A Chelsea spokesman said: ‘Our investigations into this matter are ongoing.

Bettie is pictured circa 1955Bettie was born in 1923 in Nashville, Tennessee, and rose to fame in the 1950s for her swimwear and fetish modeling.Known as the \u0027Queen of Pinups,\u0027 her measurements have been reported as the impossible sounding 36-23-35 (bust-waist-hips, in inches), making her the stuff of post-World War II era dreams. For the most part, people either lusted after her or wanted to be her and she has been attributed with helping to usher in the sexual revolution of the 1960s.One of the first centerfolds for Playboy Magazine, Bettie appeared on its pages in January of 1955 wearing a Santa hat, and nothing else, which has largely been credited as her \u0027big break.\u0027 But with that fame also came criticism, like becoming the target of federal anti-pornography investigators following bondage shoots with brother-sister photographer duo Irving and Paula Klaw.          With Bettie\u0027s fame also came criticism, like becoming the target of federal anti-pornography investigators following bondage shoots with brother-sister photographer duo Irving and Paula Klaw. Bettie is pictured with Irving Klaw, circa 1955          Known as the \u0027Queen of Pinups,\u0027 her measurements have been reported as the impossible sounding 36-23-35 (bust-waist-hips, in inches), making her the stuff of post-World War II era dreams. Bettie is shown in the 1940s posing for Confidential AdvertisingHer sister, Goldie, was a few years younger and also dabbled in the entertainment world, working as a burlesque dancer, though not to nearly the same level of notoriety.\u0027They were incredibly close,\u0027 Rodriguez told Fox News, of the Page sisters. \u0027It’s almost like they were twins. They looked alike, they were close in age, had pretty much the same interests and learned how to pose together. They both wanted to be models.\u0027Ron had talked about that there was a bit of a rivalry there in terms of modeling. He said Bettie would get a bit jealous when photographers would pay more attention to Goldie on shoots. And that Goldie was jealous of Bettie’s growing popularity in the modeling world. But overall, they were very supportive of each other.\u0027Ultimately, as Bettie\u0027s star status rose, Goldie hung up her tassels in favor of a calmer life as an art teacher and mom to Brem with the husband she found while performing a strip tease in 1956.Not long after and seemingly out of nowhere, Bettie fled the spotlight in favor of a life of isolation for the next three decades.          Her sister, Goldie, was a few years younger and also dabbled in the entertainment world, working as a burlesque dancer, though not to nearly the same level of notoriety. Bettie is shown among the burlesque performers in the film \u0027Tempest Storm - Teaserama\u0027 from 1955When Bettie finally emerged from her seclusion, she recorded narration for the documentary, \u0027Bettie Page Reveals All,\u0027 but only her voice would make it into the show, which wasn\u0027t released until after her death.When Goldie died at the age of 78 in 2004, she left behind many belongs for her son, Brem, to sort through, and when he finally did, secrets from the sisters\u0027 lives were revealed. \u0027Goldie went to great lengths to preserve these letters and photos,\u0027 Rodriguez said.The notes show a candid side of Bettie, revealing that she had a hard time with the realities of growing older, possibly driving her to avoid the camera.\u0027She did have a problem with the weight that she gained as she aged, and just aging in general,\u0027 Rodriguez said.\u0027If you look at what happened to Bettie in particular as she aged… She was having more frequent psychotic breaks, she would develop this terrible arthritis throughout her life, she was having lots of other health issues and health scares. And so, you understand why someone would think, My God, if this is aging, to hell with it.\u0027Rodriguez continued: \u0027She would plainly state that I’ve been so depressed I ate everything in sight, things like that. So she’s clearly stating that she was an emotional eater.\u0027At the time, Bettie\u0027s many fans wondered where she had gone, with Penthouse magazine going so far as to offer a $1,000 reward for anyone who could prove whether she was alive and provide information about her whereabouts in 1996, according to the Chicago Tribune.All the while, Bettie was fighting a battle with mental illness, set against the backdrop of a culture that wasn\u0027t very in tune with its prevalence. In the 1970s, Bettie\u0027s third and final husband Harry Lear alleged the retired performer had several violent outbursts. Lear accused Bettie of shouting about the \u0027retributions of God\u0027 while waving a .22-caliber pistol around a ministry retreat in Boca Raton, Florida in January of 1972, according to a Time Magazine article headlined as \u0027the felonious Bettie Page.\u0027Three months later in April, Lear accused Bettie of forcing him and his two children to pray before a portrait of Jesus while she held a knife.  Charged with breach of the peace, Bettie was confined in Jackson Memorial Hospital for four months.           Around 1957, Bettie fled the spotlight in favor of a life of isolation for the next three decades, which saw her battle mental illness and multiple run-ins with the law.

But she always maintained this stubborn optimism in the face of everything that life threw her way,\u0027 Rodriguez asid. \u0027Even through multiple hospitalizations and years of poverty and disappointment, she still got back up and hoped for more. She always kept planning a new path for herself.\u0027Bettie died in 2008 at the age of 85 after a three-week hospital stay related to pneumonia, before suffering a heart attack and slipping into a coma. She passed away at the Kindred Hospital and is buried at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary, both in Los Angeles.            Bettie died in 2008 at the age of 85 after a three-week hospital stay related to pneumonia, before suffering a heart attack and slipping into a coma.

I just did that.\u0027 \u0027We provide search today for any time you type in a key word, we as Google, we have crawled and stored copies of billions of web pages in our index. We take the keyword and match it against web pages and rank them based on over 200 signals,\u0027 Pichai said at the start of a long, technical answer. \u0027So it\u0027s not some little man sitting behind the curtain figuring out what we\u0027re going to show the user,\u0027 Lofgren asked. \u0027We don\u0027t manually intervene in any particular search result,\u0027 Pichai said.          InfoWars founder Alex Jones attended Tuesday\u0027s hearing he\u0027s been banned from several social media platforms for promoting conspiracy theories          GOP strategist Roger Stone watched Pichai\u0027s testimony he\u0027s also accused Google of biasRepublican Congressman Lamar Smith pushed Pichai hard on allegations of bias. \u0027Google could well elect our next president, with dire implications for our democracy,\u0027 he said. He asked if it was possible for an inidual Google employee to change what shows up in a user\u0027s search. \u0027It\u0027s not possible for an inidual employee or groups of employee to manipulate our search results. We have a robust framework,\u0027 Pichai said. \u0027I disagree. I think humans can manipulate the process. It is a human process at its base,\u0027 Smith said.And Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert used his five minutes of question time to lecture Pichai - never even asking a question.\u0027You\u0027re so surrounded by liberality, that hates conservatism, that hates our constitution,\u0027 he said. \u0027You don\u0027t even recognize it.\u0027\u0027You run off conservatives, you embrace liberals,\u0027 he added.Republican Rep. Steve King also joined the lecturing. He suggested Google look at employees\u0027 social media profiles to determine their political leanings. He also told Pichai that when his granddaughter was using an iPhone, she got a result on him that he wouldn\u0027t repeat in public.\u0027The iPhone is made by a different company,\u0027 Pichai responded. Apple makes the iPhone.King then said the phone could have been an Android too, which is a Google product.Pichai responded the incident could have been a notification from another app and reassured the congressman that his team would follow up. Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu also got into the bias debate. He entered his colleagues\u0027 names into Google\u0027s search engine during the hearing and noted King\u0027s top result was an article from ABC News.\u0027Let me just conclude here by stating the obvious,\u0027 Lieu said. \u0027If you want positive search results, do positive things. If you don\u0027t want negative search results, don\u0027t do negative things.\u0027He added: \u0027And to some of my colleagues across the aisle, if you\u0027re getting bad press articles and bad search results, don\u0027t blame Google or Facebook or Twitter, consider blaming yourself.\u0027 ELECTION INTERFERENCE The hearing was dominated by questions of data collection, privacy, and allegations of bias against the search giant. There was less talk about anti-trust issues and regulations with a few queries on Google\u0027s actions in the wake of the 2016 election after it was revealed Russian nationals used online platforms to influence the election. Pichai emphasized repeatedly that Google found \u0027limited activity\u0027 on behalf of Russians. He said there were only two advertising accounts the company found tied to Russian, which spent a total of $4,700.He told the lawmakers \u0027you have my promise\u0027 that the company is doing all it can to protect the integrity of U.S. elections. DATA COLLECTIONPRIVACYThe first questions put to Pichai were on Google\u0027s data collection and protection of users\u0027 privacy.Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the committee, asked the tech CEO whether the average user understands the volume of data Google collects on them. \u0027We go to great lengths\u0027 to protect users\u0027s data, Pichai reassured lawmakers.\u0027We remind users to do a privacy checkup. We make it very obvious,\u0027 he added. Republican Rep. Ted Poe held up his iPhone and asked Pichai if Google could track him if he moved across the hearing room to sit with the Democrats. \u0027Not by default but there may be a Google service you opted in to,\u0027 Pichai replied. He added he needed to know more info about the phone\u0027s settings: \u0027I genuinely don\u0027t know without looking.\u0027  SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPANYPichai was asked about sexual harassment allegations made against the company. Last month, more than 20,000 Google employees around the world walked out in protest of the company\u0027s handling of sexual harassment and discrimination claims.Earlier this year, Google ended its use of forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked if Pichai will commit to ending forced arbitration beyond sexual harassment. \u0027We are definitely reviewing what more we can do in this area,\u0027 he said. GOOGLE PLANS FOR CHINA The company\u0027s plans for China, where its search engine is currently banned, was another topic that came up repeatedly amid reports Google would launch a Chinese search engine that would comply with the country\u0027s strict censorship regulations.Critics are worried that the Google project, code-named Dragonfly, will enable the Chinese government to block its citizens from accessing information it doesn\u0027t like and surveil its political opponents. Pichai was asked if a prototype was built for a search engine in China but was vague in his response: \u0027We have explored what search could look like in a country like China.\u0027At one point \u0027we had over a hundred people working on it,\u0027 he said.Pichai revealed Google has no current plans to expand to China.\u0027Right now, we have no plans to launch in China. We don\u0027t have a search product there,\u0027 he said.But he did argue that access to information is a human right and pledged the company would be \u0027fully transparent\u0027 if they do proceed with plans to open a search engine there. He was vague when asked about future plans. Democratic Rep. David Cicilline asked him flat-out: \u0027Will you, Mr. Pichai, rule out launching a tool for surveillance and censorship in China while you are CEO of Google?\u0027\u0027I commit to engaging,\u0027 Pichia said. \u0027One of the things that\u0027s important to us as a company, we have a stated mission of providing users with information, and so we always think it\u0027s in our duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information. I have a commitment, but as I\u0027ve said earlier on this we\u0027ll be very thoughtful and we\u0027ll engage wide as we make progress.\u0027          Rep. Ted Poe held up his iphone and asked if Google could track him if moved across the roomLAWMAKERS GET PERSONAL Other lawmakers had more personal questions - and suggestions - for Pichai.Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen said he used Google\u0027s search engine often and asked Pichai if the company should have an \u0027online school people could go to, with a Google representative, and you can log in and ask questions, and not like Comcast where you get put on hold for 30 minutes.\u0027 He suggested the company have a representative for people to talk to \u0027say, how do I do this?\u0027He also revealed he googles himself and isn\u0027t happy with the search results. He appeared to be mocking conservative critics who claim bias in search results.Cohen complained he had the opposite problem. \u0027This weekend I was on MSNBC four times and the first thing that comes up is the Daily Caller,\u0027 he told Pichai, adding that Breitbart News also came up several times.\u0027It\u0027s hard for me to fathom being on 8 minutes ... and there\u0027s more content on Breitbart News,\u0027 he added.Pichai promised to follow up.  Tuesday\u0027s appearance was Pichai\u0027s first time testifying before Congress. He was sworn in - as all witnesses are - and was careful in his response. He made many promises to lawmakers to follow up, which is a way for a witness to give a more detailed, nuanced, carefully worded answer at a later time.           A protestor was removed from the hearing          Ian Madrigal, dressed as the \u0027Monopoly Man,\u0027 watches Google CEO Sundar Pichai testify           Pichai faced questions data collection, privacy and allegations of biasOPENING STATEMENTS Pichai sat quietly before the panel of lawmakers as members made their opening statements.His highly anticipated appearance is being closed watched by those in the tech industry and those who use the internet to push their platforms, including GOP operative Roger Stone and InfoWars founder Alex Jones - both of whom sat in the audience for Pichai\u0027s testimony.  \u0027Google is one of the most valuable companies in America because of what it does,\u0027 said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in his opening remarks, adding  that power \u0027comes with responsibility.\u0027McCarthy warned of a \u0027widening mistrust\u0027 between tech companies and American people. He said that could be alleviated by transparency and answers.He warned the panel wants to know that any political bias among Google employees does not show up in its products. McCarthy, who has been a fierce critic of the technology company, said a question before them was whether American technology companies are surveying as instruments of freedom or fo control.          Google CEO Sundar Pichai is greeted by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the hearing          Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who started at the company as an engineer, at times got technical in his answers\u0027A free world depends on a free internet,\u0027 he said, \u0027and we need to know Google is on the side of the free world.\u0027Democrat Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking member on the committee, warned against focusing on \u0027right wing conspiracy theories\u0027 during Monday\u0027s questioning.He said it was a \u0027fantasy\u0027 that there was political bias in its search results, a charge President Donald Trump has made against the internet giant.\u0027No credible evidence supports this right wing conspiracy theory,\u0027 Nadler said.He urged the committee to focus on whether outside activists were using Google to spread false information to undermine American democracy.Pichai, in his opening testimony, said the internet giant steers clear of \u0027political bias,\u0027 arguing that this is a core principle of its business to maintain trust of users.Pichai also said privacy and security are essential parts of Google\u0027s mission, and that the company is committed to working with the U.S. government \u0027to keep our country safe and secure.\u0027Pichai strongly denied claims made by by PresidentTrump and his backers earlier this year that Google operates with a political agenda that suppresses conservative voices.\u0027Users also look to us to provide accurate, trusted information,\u0027 he said. \u0027We work hard to ensure the integrity of our products, and we\u0027ve put a number of checks and balances in place to ensure they continue to live up to our standards.\u0027Pichai said Google strives to offer \u0027platforms for erse perspectives and opinions\u0027 without promoting its own agenda.\u0027I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests,\u0027 he said.Pichai said that Google - which on Monday speeded up the shutdown of its Google+ social network after a second data security bug was discovered - supports federal privacy legislation, without offering specifics.          Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified before Congress for the first time Tuesday          Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee promised tough questions at Tuesday\u0027s hearing,\u0027Protecting the privacy and security of our users has long been an essential part of our mission,\u0027 he said.The tech CEO also sought to allay concerns that Google was snubbing American values by its decision this year to drop out of the bidding for a major Pentagon cloud computing project.\u0027Even as we expand into new markets we never forget our American roots,\u0027 he said.\u0027It\u0027s no coincidence that a company dedicated to the free flow of information was founded right here in the US. As an American company, we cherish the values and freedoms that have allowed us to grow and serve so many users.\u0027The appearance  tested Pichai\u0027s ability to be the public face of the search engine giant.\u0027It remains to be seen whether he can step up and be the kind of diplomat and statesman Google requires him to be,\u0027 Arun Sundararajan, a business professor at New York University, told The Wall Street Journal.  \u0027He has, for most of his career, been a product guy.\u0027 But he has slowly made in-road into the political world. Pichai was the White House on Thursday for a meeting between White House officials and tech execs, including representatives from Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and Qualcomm.President Donald Trump stopped by but it was Ivanka Trump who took the lead. Firebrand Republican congressman says he DOES want to be...Fired FBI chief James Comey says Trump could be \u0027in serious...Trump defends hush money payments to alleged mistresses as...Share this articleThe use of artificial intelligence was the main item on the agenda. Pichai is dipping his toe in the political well in the wake of waves caused by his predecessor Eric Schmidt, who had powerful political allies in both parties and counted former President Barack Obama as a friend. Google had some of its political peaks in the Obama years when it beat an antitrust probe  and secured favorable policies on net neutrality, online liability and copyright issues. But the political winds have shifted since then for online companies.Lawmakers are examining the need for stronger federal protections governing the collection of online data and some Republicans complain there is a suppression of conservative speech. President Trump has tweeted his complaints about the company, charging Google\u0027s search results are rigged.             Pichai\u0027s predecessor Eric Schmidt was close with President Barack Obama          Lawmakers left an empty chair in September when Google skipped a Senate Intelligence Committee hearingPichai has kept a  low profile since becoming Google\u0027s chief in 2015. A native of Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company, starting as an engineer. He has already made overtures to Washington after the company angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in September, when it failed to send top leaders to appear at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing along Facebook\u0027s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter\u0027s Jack Dorsey. Lawmakers left an empty chair at the witness table to symbolize Google\u0027s absence. Pichai flew to Washington D.C. later in September for inidual meetings with lawmakers - and agreed to Tuesday\u0027s committee hearing.Google CEO Faces Hot Seat in Washington - WSJGoogle\u0027s turn for the Facebook treatment - AxiosGoogle Hearing to Preview Democrats’ Strategy on Big Tech - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Google employees sought block Breitbart Google AdSense","story":"    Google CEO Sundar Pichai arrives to testify before the House Judiciary Committee to be questioned about the internet giant\u0027s privacy security and data collection, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2018Breitbart has previously published conspiracy theories about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, with many of its ideologically-driven stories having been discredited as false or intentionally misleading.  Google\u0027s Head of Americas GMP Partner Technical Services, Jeff Lakusta, replied to the email chain telling his colleagues that would be \u0027tough\u0027 to prove Breitbart is hate speech.   Muslim Job Centre worker fired for tweets criticising Donald...Share this article    An empty chair reserved for Google, which refused to send its top executive, as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington in September\u0027We enforce these policies vigorously, consistently and without any political bias.

A diseased piglet who had lost a large swathe of skin from its back was left untended \u0027The piglets and their mothers live above their own excrement on a concrete slatted floor in bare, often dirty pens,\u0027 he said.\u0027It is a dismal and inhumane existence.\u0027\u0027The culling of the tail and grinding of the teeth are standard practices, which are forbidden by law when they are routine.\u0027The piglets are screaming during these painful actions while the mother pigs, captive between the iron bars, are left helplessly watching.\u0027Animal Rights spokesman Robert Molenaar said the scenes at the two pigsties are \u0027unfortunately no excesses but standard practice in Dutch pig farming\u0027.Molenaar added that the Dutch Inspectorate drafted 77 reports and sent out 37 letters over violations and gave 21 written warnings (out of 350 inspections) to pig farms.He added: \u0027Until recently this kind of undercover footage was rarely made public in the Netherlands, which is why many consumers and politicians were left in the delusion that \u0027everything is arranged quite well\u0027 in the Netherlands.          The shocking footage  exposed the filthy conditions the pigs were forced to live in at the farms\u0027Now it turns out that a very great deal is wrong. The undercover footage has unleashed a lot in the Netherlands, which resulted in political questions to the Agriculture Minister.\u0027MP Esther Ouwehand, of the Party for Animals, has said her party will question Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten about the issue, demanding she take action to stop the animal cruelty in these pig farms.But Molenaar said consumers also have a responsibility to act.He said: \u0027Animal Rights calls for all consumers to put meat aside during the Christmas period. Peace for animals starts on the plate of the consumer.\u0027According to Animal Rights, most pigs in the Netherlands are kept for the export of pork abroad, with the UK being the prime market for Dutch pig farmers.The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) reports that the UK is a net importer of pork - currently importing around 60 per cent of the pork the country consumes.Together with Denmark and Germany, the Netherlands accounts for almost two-thirds of British pork imports. "},{"url":null,"title":"Chelsea fan previously defended yob supporters Paris Metro","story":"Share this articleChelsea fan who abused Raheem Sterling previously backed Blues thug who kicked black man off train"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2068ca5f1b5c843f4e4e1fca810bd53ac56921b3/29_27_3956_2374/master/3956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e959a87acfbd2378a872e349138a69f5","title":"the big picture neil libbert new york ice skaters","story":"The Observer and  photographer Neil Libbert’s winter shot of Central Park remains one of his favourites decades onNeil Libbert, who has worked for the Observer and the  for nearly 60 years, took this photograph of ice-skaters in Central Park in December 1960. It appeared on the front page of the  on the last day of that month, referencing a long cold snap in New York City that ran beyond John F Kennedy’s inauguration the following January.Libbert took the photo at the very end of a four-month trip across the country, starting in Oregon, accompanying the celebrated  journalist WJ Weatherby. The photographer was 22 years old. He stayed in the Chelsea Hotel for $5 a night and walked the streets most of the day, up to Harlem and back to Greenwich Village, enthralled by what he saw.The Wollman ice rink in Central Park opened in 1949, and during the autumn and winter months remains a much-loved New York destination for skaters – though the Gotham City backdrop that Libbert captured has partly given way to the glass and steel monster apartment blocks of West 59th street.Of all the thousands of wonderful photographs that Libbert has had published in the  and the Observer in the 58 years since, this one, he suggests, remains a perennial favourite. At a recent show of his work at the Michael Hoppen gallery in New York, prints were snapped up by American collectors. However, when he first brought the picture home to be printed in Manchester, where the  was still based, readers who looked at it wondered if Libbert – a native of Salford – had taken the photo of the skaters with LS Lowry in mind.

As a centenary tribute, could I follow his routines for 24 hours?With the publication of his short novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich in 1962, Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn became the first to chronicle the crushing brutality of daily life in the Soviet Union’s prison camps. Sentenced without trial to eight years forced labour and persecuted for years by the KGB, the Nobel prize-winning writer was a spiritual and moral authority for thousands of Russians until his death at the age of 89 in 2008.But – dare I ask – do the harrowing details of his biography, and the weightiness of the tomes that he wrote, cause us to take Solzhenitsyn a little too seriously? Blinded by the big bushy beard and loose peasant’s smock that gave him the aura of an Old Testament figure, it’s easy to overlook the fact that Solzhenitsyn’s lifelong ascetic tendencies, stretching long before and after his imprisonment, are almost as endearingly eccentric as they are admirable.To mark 11 December’s 100th anniversary of his birth, I decided to spend 24 hours in the life of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. I’ll never complain about Friday-night deadlines again.1am: Wake up. When he was writing his monumental attack on the Soviet regime, The Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn would rise at 1am, work until 9am, grudgingly take a short break, then pick back up again until 6pm.I spot the moon through my curtains, decide that battling authoritarianism can wait a few more hours, roll over and go back to sleep.6am: Fell at the first hurdle. But it’s onwards and upwards from here.6.10am: It is breakfast time. Each year on 9 February, Solzhenitsyn would mark the day he was first arrested in 1945. On his self-styled Convict’s Day he would allow himself only the rations he had been permitted by the camp authorities: 23 ounces of bread, a bowl of broth and a ladle of oats.It might be December, but I’m going to recreate this feast. Lacking the traditional gourmet delights of a gulag kitchen, a dissolved Oxo cube, some slightly stale slices of toast and a sprinkling of corn flakes seem like a suitably unsatisfying substitute.6.30am: Shuffle sheepishly back to the kitchen. Apparently, 21st-century stomachs aren’t as hardy as those bred in the Russian Caucasus 100 years ago. Two poached eggs later and I am revived and raring to get to work.7am: I turn on my laptop and begin my research into Solzhenitsyn’s life. A man who would make Margaret Thatcher’s working hours look like Homer Simpson’s, the author was still feverishly craning over his notebooks for more than 14 hours a day well into his 80s – despite acute problems with his spine that left him unable to walk.10am: Time for a spot of (not so) light reading, of Solzhenitsyn’s 581-page novel The First Circle. When he was 10, Solzhenitsyn read the entirety of War and Peace and decided that he would write an equivalent saga of the Russian Revolution. At the end of his life he was working on a 20-volume epic, about four times longer than Tolstoy’s, entitled The Red Wheel.10.03am: Somewhat distracted, I check my Facebook feed. Inspecting a friend’s Majorca holiday snaps with her new boyfriend, I feel a twinge of guilt. Would Solzhenitsyn approve of my wanton interest in such frivolous matters? I think not.When the author first began a relationship with his wife at university, it was with the caveat that their meetings should last only an hour and take place after the libraries closed at 10pm. Even during these fleeting amorous rendezvous he would ask her to quiz him on his history dates.Later in his life, Solzhenitsyn embarked on a passionate affair with the brilliant mathematician Olga Ladyzhenskaya – but the romance ended when he decided that sex was distracting him from his writing. I diligently reopen the BBC’s Timeline of the history of the Soviet Union.11am: After he was exiled from the USSR in 1974, Solzhenitsyn entered a self-imposed confinement in the US. He shut himself away to work undisturbed and began a hermitic existence in a log cabin deep in the mountains of Vermont. Surrounding himself with Russian prison archives and a barbed-wire fence, Solzhenitsyn had the shop owners in the nearest village place signs in their windows warning journalists: “NO directions to the Solzhenitsyns.”I go for a quick stroll to the shops. After smiling and nodding at the postman, I quickly realise my mistake and shove on a pair of dark glasses to regain my cover. Solzhenitsyn would not smile at strangers.2pm: Back at my desk, I try to recall fragments of what I’d been reading about the author’s biography.Solzhenitsyn cultivated a unique writing method during his prison years: he would scribble lines for his future novels on scraps of paper, memorise the words and then swiftly burn them before they were discovered. I jot down what I can remember on a Post-it, grab a match and begin cremating my still-sticky note. By the time the last fluorescent pink slither has curled into ash, I’ve forgotten my Solzhenitsyn fun fact. Back to Wikipedia it is …6pm: My working day finally finished, there’s just enough time to enjoy a well-earned dinner (the rest of my stock cube broth and some more stale bread) and still be in bed by 7pm in line with the Solzhenitsyn family clock.7pm: Before tucking myself in, I place a pair of knitting needles next to the pillow (just in case of any unwelcome night-time knocks on the door). For many years Solzhenitsyn would sleep with a pitchfork next to his bed. A year after he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, the KGB tried to assassinate the writer by arranging for a poisoned needle to be stabbed into his back. Though surely there are no Russian agents lurking around my home in sleepy Wiltshire …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8905eb580f9c019494a88a36bf0fa353d55bddcf/0_155_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=460cec494df59eb23ff56e50d487f85f","title":"marks and spencer appoints former sainsburys chief justin king to board","story":"M\u0026ampS hopes King’s appointment will help struggling retailer revive profitsMarks \u0026amp Spencer has drafted in grocery industry heavyweight Justin King as the struggling retailer embarks on a fresh crusade to revive profits.King, who said M\u0026ampS held a “very special place” in his affections, is best known for his long stint at the helm of Sainsbury’s. Before that, the 57-year-old spent three years working for M\u0026ampS running its £6bn-turnover food business.The appointment of King as a non-executive director reunites the businessman with Archie Norman, who is a year into his chairmanship. The pair worked together on the successful turnaround of Asda in the 1990s.Commenting on King’s appointment, Norman said: “Justin’s appointment completes a very significant reorientation of the board in the last year. He will be a great addition to a strong team.”After a decade of failed reinventions, the 134-year-old M\u0026ampS is now aiming for sustainable, profitable growth in three to five years by shutting less successful stores. When the chief executive, Steve Rowe, updated the City on first-half sales last month there was no good news, with declines in both clothing and food sales as, after several years of outperformance, the wheels also came off M\u0026ampS’s Simply Food chain.M\u0026ampS said King, who joins the board on 1 January, was one of the pioneers of Simply Food: “He brings in-depth experience of retail transformation and operations as well as a good historic understanding of the M\u0026ampS business and values.”King is celebrated for his turnaround of Sainsbury’s when he joined in 2004 it was a near basket case. One of his biggest headaches was an expensive new network of automated food depots that was unable to track stock properly. At the time the misfiring warehouses contributed to empty shelves and millions of pounds of lost or damaged stock.Analysts suggested King’s experience at Sainsbury’s would increase scrutiny of Rowe, an M\u0026ampS lifer, and the retailer’s new food managing director, Stuart Machin. They also speculated that, should Norman lose patience with either man, he would have a ready-made replacement, although Britain’s corporate governance guidelines advise against moving a non-executive director to an executive role.King will continue as vice-chairman of Terra Firma, the private equity firm led by the tax exile Guy Hands which he joined in 2015. However, it was recently reported that he is stepping back from day-to-day management of the buyout group.

The problem she cannot overcome in this hung parliament is the synergetic fanaticism of the retro-imperialist Tory right and the DUP. Together they have made the backstop issue totemic because – in time-honoured fashion – they wish to retain the UK’s freedom to inflict unilateral damage on Ireland.Nevertheless, May has levers against the less hardline leavers. One is her own patent determination to go the extra mile. But the most effective is the ticking of the clock and the well-placed fear of no deal. May’s deal, for all its faults, would be the better option.Nevertheless there is a third option, although it is extremely fraught and contingent. It involves, first, pausing article 50, second, offering a Norway-plus arrangement and, third, if that is rejected, calling a second referendum on the original issue of remain or leave. But this depends on two huge things happening at Westminster.First, it needs Tory leadership, possibly (though improbably) from May herself, or from a liberal Tory such as Amber Rudd, to offer a new cross-party, backbench-based pact – including both Labour and the SNP. This would be, in effect though not name, an unofficial, strictly temporary, issue-based, national parliamentary government.Second, Labour needs to support it. This would almost certainly take place against Jeremy Corbyn’s will. The consequences for politics would be disruptive and long-lasting. But it is hard to see another way of preventing Brexit from destroying our national life – other than May getting her deal, for which there is no majority.It is often said there is still a Commons majority for a softer Brexit or a second vote. At present, however, for all John Bercow’s heroic efforts, this majority remains an angel imprisoned within a block of marble from which it has not yet been carved. Without a sculptor, however, we are heading for no deal.How can Theresa May snatch victory from the jaws of defeat? The prime minister’s decision to delay the vote on her Brexit deal came from a place of weakness after ministers convinced her that the scale of defeat would prove fatal not just to the deal but to her entire premiership.Yet in choosing to delay, May has stored up more problems for herself. Arch-Brexiteers and arch-remainers wanted the vote to proceed so they could finally kill off the deal while May has lost what little goodwill she had with those ministers who were sent on the airwaves to insist the vote would go ahead.May needs to show that she is finally listening to MPs’ concerns and that the troublesome issue of the Irish backstop can be worked on. So far, the signs are not great. May herself appeared to admit that she would not be looking to reopen the legally binding part of the deal. Meanwhile, EU leaders have been quick to say there will be no renegotiation – only a few clarifications.This won’t be enough to assuage the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson. But they are not May’s target audience. What took both the whips and No 10 by surprise in the negative response to the deal was how MPs who come from the middle of the party on Europe – such as Will Quince, Michael Fallon and George Freeman – came out against it.May does, though, appear to be listening to one influential Tory. She heeded the very public advice of Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, to delay the vote until the backstop had been clarified. May now needs to give those MPs who want to back her deal a reason to do so.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondentCalling a vote of no confidence now would hand a reeling Theresa May the lifeline she desperately craves. Given the DUP’s current position is to support the government unless May’s backstop deal is passed, she would win the vote. The narrative would shift to May re-establishing her authority. Those Labour backbenchers and SNP MPs pushing for such a vote know this, of course. Ian Murray, one such Labour MP, told Radio 5 Live on Monday that after the vote of no confidence is “dispensed with” – ie lost – the party would be forced to move on the next component of its party policy, to back a second referendum. They do not want a general election to happen, and indeed it would not happen if a vote is taken now.Labour should instead hold on until May humiliatingly fails, again, to extract any meaningful concessions from the EU. With the government then in even more catastrophically dire straits than now, there would at least be the chance of May losing a vote. That’s in line with the spirit of Labour’s 2018 conference policy, too, which prioritises a general election as “the best outcome for the country”, but that if such an election cannot be engineered, then the party “must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote”.It may well be that a second referendum will end up as the only option left standing. It is not the simple big red shiny button its most avid proponents suggest it is. Settling on a question and the number of options will be exceptionally fraught, and such a vote will be a viciously bitter and isive affair, far more so than even last time. Nonetheless, the left has to prepare now for such an eventuality, not least to ensure that a remain campaign is not run by the establishment pro-status quo types who are doomed to defeat. In the meantime, though, if Labour is not going to provoke profound, irreversible disillusionment from leave voters, it has to treat a second referendum as the last possible resort. It can then tell the people of Blackpool, Mansfield and Ashfield that it did everything it could to make it work, but that the party was left with no choice.Anger about the vote being dropped will continue to dominate the mood in parliament. If Labour get a censure motion through, it could open further moves, though a no-confidence motion seems remote just now. Labour inflicted big defeats last week and will keep pressing now – expect it to take advantage of the strong support the Speaker has shown for anything that respects the House.There are many potential plot twists to come. Theresa May’s future depends on how her party reacts. MPs will start looking to the Christmas break, but they are also aware that the clocking is ticking for a negotiated exit. May’s immediate focus is on renegotiation. She will try to extract concessions from the EU, particularly on giving parliament a stronger say or greater reassurance on the backstop. How much she is likely to get we will know in the next few days, and the outlook is not good as the EU is already talking about not re-opening the withdrawal agreement. Yet, as Donald Tusk says, it is keen to help “facilitate UK ratification”.The EU also wants to avoid a no-deal outcome, and we know the UK is stepping up no-deal preparation. We don’t know when the prime minister will come back with answers. After Christmas seems likely, but even with all sides of her disunited party clamouring for answers, she may not control the timetable.• Catherine Haddon is senior fellow at the Institute for Government"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089eeaa1cc194672c0d8f6b191991b0f18043739/6_0_1733_1041/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f82c11ef4c14c22accb80d2757cba397","title":"the guardian view on mps and brexit parliament must decide","story":"Britain’s raging argument about Brexit is increasingly morphing into a contest about more issues than just this country’s relationship with the European Union. It is also turning into a contest about the relationship between two sources of democratic power – referendums and parliament. Referendums claim to elevate the people’s will over parliament, which is expected to defer indefinitely and in detail. Yet Britain’s historic constitutional doctrine, still bred in the bone of most MPs, has traditionally been that parliament is sovereign.The Victorian jurist AV Dicey argued long ago that parliament “has the right to make or unmake any law whatever” and that “no person or body is recognised by the law … as having the right to override or set aside the legislation of parliament”. Much has changed in the laws of Britain since Dicey, including human rights legislation, devolution and Britain’s 45-year membership of what is now the EU. Nevertheless the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty that he set out remains a guiding and established principle for the courts and for all parties and MPs, whether they are remainers or leavers.However, parliament’s rights are being relentlessly stress-tested by the Brexit crisis. Several times since the 2016 referendum, parliament has asserted its sovereign right to make the final decisions on Brexit, often in the face of government opposition. Examples include the original article 50 withdrawal decision itself, the call for a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal and, only last week, the instruction to publish the attorney general’s legal advice to ministers on the withdrawal agreement. If, in the coming weeks, there is a successful attempt to pause the article 50 process, as Sir John Major advocated on Tuesday, or a vote for a second referendum, then this process will have reached an even greater climax.There was another interim clash in this process on Monday when Theresa May decided unilaterally to suspend the debate on her Brexit deal, which had been due to come to the vote on Tuesday evening. That decision was an insult to MPs, especially the 164 who had already spoken in the debate. It made a mockery of the belief that parliament, rather than government, is in charge of its own processes.When a government has a clear majority, this issue is blurred. Yet in a hung parliament, with no overall majority and both major parties split over Brexit, it is painfully obvious that MPs’ claim to control their own house is in fact still dependent on ministers for much of the time. The Speaker, John Bercow, rightly denounced Mrs May’s decision to pull the vote on Monday. He is clearly up for a long fight to defend the Commons against ministerial attempts to railroad MPs. A Labour backbencher grabbed the Commons mace in protest. On Tuesday, rather than debating the Brexit deal, MPs instead found themselves toothlessly debating why they were not debating it.This is a crucial battle, whose importance goes beyond remain versus leave. Mrs May’s decision to stop the debate must not mean that the procedural concessions that MPs have won are simply wiped from the record when – or if – Mrs May comes back from her travels with a revised version of the withdrawal deal or a new addendum to it. In the Commons on Tuesday the cabinet office minister David Lidington appeared to accept that five days of withdrawal agreement debate are paused, not aborted. It is essential that this should be so.This country needs to have the vote on the Brexit deal but it also needs a Commons that is empowered to make its own decision in time to prevent a no-deal alternative. The vote should therefore happen as soon as possible, not at the last minute. The ensuing process should be facilitated and not blocked by the party whips. Many MPs on all sides grasp this. It is vital that they, and Mr Bercow, stand firm and ensure that the Commons takes charge. Brexiters in the government and on the backbenches always claim to regard a sovereign House of Commons as a fundamental pillar of leaving the EU.

His favourite pastimes are to read and write, especially in retirement when he sits at the dining table for hours on end, crafting deep essays and sublime poetry. I have bought him writing pads and elegant pens but there are only so many of those a writer needs and lately, knowing my penchant for pens, he has been giving them back to me to “use in the meantime”.His computer is ageing – you could comfortably make a cup of tea and drink half by the time it stirs. Recently, some hackers cunningly singled out all his Indian contacts to be notified that he had an urgent illness that required a financial bailout. Their consternation was nothing compared to my dad’s. It turned out that his backup system for five years of writing had been his brain. My husband and a shop managed to retrieve the data but my faith in his computer was forever lost.I’ll get him a laptop, I think, pleased with myself.“Let me buy you a new laptop for your birthday”, I say.He frowns. “Why? My old one is fine.”Worried that a new laptop might just upset his writing pattern, I relent.The next week, the birthday a bit closer, I offer to replace his smartphone, which could really be a great deal smarter, but he is not convinced: “My phone makes calls, sends texts, and fetches mail. What more would a new one do?” I can’t say.Leaving me contemplating the infinite possibilities, my children do what they can. They bake him their favourite chocolate chip cookies. Since they steal away some of the raw ingredients, they manage only ten finished products, which turn out just right – large, golden and chewy. One cookie mysteriously crumbles, and they keep one each for their brilliant effort. This leaves six cookies hastily placed in a used plastic bag and placed into their grandfather’s hands. He is gratified and thrilled beyond words. For the next few days, he savours his grandchildren’s cookies bit by bit, ignoring his daughter’s protestations about sugar hits for breakfast.Which still leaves me short of a present – and now, competing with my own children!I go to work hoping to find inspiration. Every pre-Christmas clinic brings up a similar set of anxieties for a different set of people. Is it OK to have a break at Christmas? If I skip a dose, will my cancer grow faster? Can we give Dad a glass of wine at lunch? Could this be Mum’s last Christmas?I try to answer each question with honesty and consideration, regarding the disease in the context of the person. The majority of patients are reassured to hear that skipping a treatment will not jeopardise their wellbeing and in fact, a convivial family gathering may be the most therapeutic intervention of all. I witness people’s expression turn to joy at the thought of a Christmas unfettered by the toxicities of treatment – and as I sign the orders, I secretly can’t help feeling a tiny bit like a magician.But no closer to finding the perfect gift.Later that day, I meet an elderly man who has resolutely denied my interpretations of his illness, insisting that he feels fine. Worried at the fatal toxicities that chemotherapy can impose, I hope that Christmas will tempt him to take a break. But to my surprise, he wants to know why we close for a public holiday. Sensing my frustration, he reluctantly offers an explanation,“If I stop treatment, I may not see my son. He drives me to chemotherapy and takes me home – it’s our time together. It’s the nicest thing about having treatment.”Then he sits back and looks out of the window as I let his simple and devastating reason wash over me.Did he really see toxic chemotherapy as the price to pay for seeing his son? Had it taken a terminal illness for father and son to talk regularly? I don’t know for sure, but I can see that he believes it and that’s what matters.“Tell me about your son”, I say, so that my chaotic thoughts might settle.When he has finished, I realise that he has told me nothing about who his son is or what he does, only the times they have spent together that mean so much. They are mundane too – trips in the car, buying groceries, picking up a grandchild, going to the carwash.He knows everyone is busy but still, he can’t deny that his son’s company is his greatest consolation and his nicest reward. So, if that means having some extra chemotherapy, so be it. I listen to him, moved and humbled, and a little lost for words.I find myself thinking of a friend who gave his mother 60 walks for her 60th birthday. Each week’s walk was a great commitment but far more meaningful than any wrapped present. And another friend who visited her mother every single week for the years she spent in residential care, dementia chipping away at her core. In the end, there was no gift to give her save that of a familiar presence that could expect no return. It must have been a heart-wrenching gift to give, but at the same time, priceless.And it dawns on me that in searching for that elusive gift for an ageing parent, we are neglecting the one that is most obvious, the gift of our time. In an age where we live and work in far-flung corners of the world, spending time together isn’t always easy or practical but we deceive ourselves by thinking that it doesn’t matter. The antidote to an epidemic of loneliness doesn’t lie in sending a bigger gift but in exercising our imagination. If the stories of my patients are anything to go by, our imagination would tell us to show up a little more, to call a little more and to simply be more attentive. A sorrow shared is a sorrow ided. No medical advance, and no wrapped gift, could ever compete with this.I tell my patient that I will talk to his son and we will figure something out. He says thank you for not judging him. Then I stop looking for a gift for my dad and call him to say I will pick him up and we will go for a drive. I’ll be ready, he says.• Ranjana Srivastava is is an oncologist and  Australia columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99867cc7b2db94069d770eff85eeb1a916d718bc/0_0_941_572/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9404921f53b8c85063e2cd8512ad84cb","title":"comedians asked to sign behavioural agreement for soas gig","story":"Organiser apologises ‘for the misunderstanding’ after comic pulls out of fundraiserComedians invited to perform at a benefit gig at Soas University of London have been sent a “behavioural agreement” that forbids them from tackling any topic in a way that is not “respectful and kind”.Konstantin Kisin, a comedian and free speech campaigner, pulled out of next month’s event after being sent the contract. “I was genuinely shocked,” he said. “I’ve performed at students unions many times before and never been asked to sign a contract.”Kisin was among five comedians scheduled to perform at the event, which is being held to raise money for Unicef. They all received an email from Fisayo Eniolorunda, the organiser from Soas’s Unicef on Campus society. The email read: “Attached is a short behavioural agreement form that we will ask for you to sign on the day to avoid problems.”It said the contract had been written “to ensure an environment where joy, love and acceptance are reciprocated by all.” By signing it, the performers were “agreeing to our no tolerance policy with regards to racism, sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia or anti-religion or anti-atheism.”It added: “All topics must be presented in a way that is respectful and kind. It does not mean that these topics can not be discussed. But, it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way.”Kisin said it was vital that comedians were not prevented from exploring difficult issues on stage.“Obviously performers shouldn’t be allowed to go on stage with the intention of being racist or homophobic,” he said. “But comedians play with ideas and sometimes we stray over the line, or are perceived to have done so. It’s vital that we’re not prevented from playing with ideas in that way or forced to sign contracts that mean if that happens, we’re held up as having broken our word.”The National Union of Students said contracts of this sort were very unusual. “There is little to no evidence that students’ unions are routinely dictating what they can and can’t say,” a spokesperson said.“Some students’ unions will have policies to ensure a booking is appropriate others will not. There is more likely to be a basic ‘sense check’, as would occur in any other venue, to ensure that there isn’t an obvious mismatch between a booking and the audience they’ll be performing in front of.”Unicef on Campus societies are independent of Unicef’s national organisation. The society said in a statement: “We are a group of students who … do not represent Unicef or any student body. We extended an invitation to guests with the idea of hosting a comedy night to raise funds. Given that Unicef is a children’s charity, we wanted to make sure it was an appropriate event for the cause. We would never wish to impose that guests would have to agree to anything they do not believe in. We apologise for the misunderstanding.”Soas students’ union said it did not require external speakers to sign any form of contract before speaking at events and the Unicef on Campus society had been “overzealous” in interpreting guidelines. A spokesperson said: “The union believes fully in freedom of speech and the freedom to try to make people laugh.”Examples of student unions dictating what comedians can and cannot discuss are rare. In 2015, Goldsmiths, University of London cancelled a gig by the comedian and political activist Kate Smurthwaite after reports that campaigners were threatening to picket the event because of her views on decriminalising sex work.In 2014, the comic Dapper Laughs was banned from performing at Cardiff University after more than 700 people signed a petition complaining that his show “trivialised rape, unprotected sex and dehumanising of women”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749df71f2f36fa864ab8da4bb04bf46018e35920/0_300_6266_3760/master/6266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc6307e00703d14de7dc6b2b84f256f","title":"we could smell the boat approaching grim truth animal exports israel haifa","story":"Broken bones and other injuries are common for sheep and cattle held on ships for weeks in cramped pens. Photojournalist  Jo-Anne McArthur tracked the 22,000 arrivals on one boat in Israel’s Haifa portHundreds of thousands of live animals are transported each year on ships from Australia and Europe to the Middle East. The route from Australia to Israel is particularly long – the journey is three weeks at sea, where cattle and sheep are often kept in cramped pens for the duration.It’s estimated this year Israel will import 114,040 animals (cattle and sheep) from Australia, and 409,123 sheep and 169,991 cattle from Europe. Though these figures are lower than the previous year, in general live imports have been on the rise. Israel is expected to import 700,000 live animals this year – up from 200,000 in 2012.In July, I went to Israel to photograph the Australian ships coming into port in Haifa. One of the boats, the Bahijah, was carrying an estimated 22,000 animals.I spent a week monitoring the ships at port, waiting for news of one of the live imports. When we heard the Bahijah was coming in, we managed to rent a yacht that morning and meet the ship at sea. I was able to photograph the ship and the animals from a distance.The ship completely dwarfed us. I was struck by the smell. Even from further away we could smell the boat approaching. At almost every window you could see animals crowded together. The ones at the windows are lucky because they’re getting fresh air.The movement from the sea is really unsteady, and the animals are not used to that: in some cases they suffer injuries and broken bones. In April, a whistleblower employed on a live export ship worked with Animals Australia to reveal the situation on board a vessel. Footage from five shipments from Australia to the Middle East appeared to show sheep covered in faeces and severely decomposed bodies left in pens with living sheep. In one particular journey, more than 880 animals died during the course of the voyage.The story doesn’t end when the ships arrive at port.From here, the animals are unloaded on to trucks. This can take up to 12 and even 16 hours because there are thousands of animals on board.The cattle and sheep are then transported cross-country. I trailed trucks for hours to feedlots near Eilat, and to quarantine in a settlement in the West Bank. The feedlots were dusty and crowded. The animals in quarantine were lethargic.Dead farm animals are routinely washing up on Tel Avivian public beaches. Due to the distressing conditions animals are in, many don’t survive the journey at sea and it’s believed their corpses are just thrown overboard. The washed-up animals often have the ears or heads missing, so their ear tags can’t be traced to identify the ships.The dead and dying in feedlots are also often disposed in the desert. I witnessed football field-sized parcels of land with mounds of manure and decomposing animal bodies that must have been there for decades. The images can’t convey the stench, or the flies. The future of the controversial live imports trade is uncertain. A bill has been proposed in the Israeli Knesset to phase out live imports of animals from Australia and Europe for slaughter because of the suffering it causes the animals. The bill would reduce the transportation of live animals while increasing tax-free imports of fresh meat, and encourage local production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/627517b31cbebd6957182362cbf659198d405e56/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894f0cfbb6b5aeeb223c12b64a1bf777","title":"sparkle the rules of giving jewellery this christmas","story":"Snowman earrings and big-name trinkets are a good bet.

The procedure may sound bizarre or difficult, but I assure you it is neither. Serves 6-8 as an antipasticold water 1 litrechickpea flour 300g olive oil for fryingsalt a big pinchlemon wedges to serveIn a large pan, whisk the cold water and the chickpea flour until it forms a smooth batter with no lumps. Tip the batter into a large, heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat and whisk steadily.After 10 minutes or so, the batter will start thickening and now you really need to whisk to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom. Once the mixture is coming away cleanly from the sides of the pan, it is ready.Now, moving swiftly, use a spatula to smear the batter on to a clean marble surface, a large flat tin, or plates. The layer should be 3-5mm thick. Let the mixture cool completely. If you have spread it on to a work surface or tin, it can be cut into squares where it is. If you have smeared it on to plates, peel off the layer of batter carefully and cut each one into slim wedges.In a pan or deep frying pan, heat the oil to frying temperature, which is 180C, or when a cube of bread dances on the surface of the oil and turns golden after 20 seconds. Fry the panelle in small batches until they are crisp and golden. Lift from the oil with a slotted spoon on to kitchen paper to drain briefly, then transfer to a serving plate. Sprinkle with salt and serve straightaway, with lemon wedges.From Two Kitchens by Rachel Roddy, (Headline Home, £26)You will need a loose 24cm round tart tin base to cook the pie.Serves 6partridges 3bay leaves 3onion 1 smallred onions 2carrots 3 mediumcelery 2 ribsolive oil 6 tbspbutter 20gsmoked streaky bacon 8 rashersthyme 8 sprigsrosemary 2 busy sprigsgarlic 2 clovesherby butcher’s sausages 8ground allspice ½ tspground cinnamon ½ tspground mace ½ tsppuff pastry 500geggs 2For the sauceclementine or small orange 1dried cranberries 50gdry marsala 150mlredcurrant jelly 4 tbspPut the partridges into a deep saucepan then pour over enough cold water to cover the birds. Bring to the boil with the bay leaves and the small onion. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover with a lid, and let the partridges cook for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the red onions, finely chop the carrots and cut the celery into small slices. Warm the olive oil and butter in a large, deep pan, stir in the red onion, carrot and celery and cook for 5 minutes until the onion is translucent. Roughly chop the bacon and stir into the vegetables.Pull the leaves from the thyme sprigs and the needles from the rosemary. Chop the rosemary finely. Peel and finely crush the garlic then stir, together with the herbs, into the vegetables.Remove the skins from the sausages then put the sausage meat into a large mixing bowl. Add the ground allspice, cinnamon and mace and season with salt and black pepper.Remove the birds from their cooking liquor, let them cool briefly then remove the breast meat from the bones. It should come away easily. If not, slice it off the bones with a kitchen knife. Retain the remaining meat, bones and cooking liquor for stock.Stir the softened onion and bacon mixture into the seasoned sausage meat, mixing thoroughly. I tend to use my hands here.Cut off one third of the puff pastry and roll it to fit the base of a round 24cm tart tin with a little extra overlapping the edge. You can trim this later. Pile half the sausage and herb stuffing on top of the pastry, leaving 2cm or so of bare pastry around the edge. Smooth the surface level and place the 6 partridge breasts on top then add the remaining mixture, smoothing the top into a dome.Roll out the second piece of puff pastry to fit plentifully over the meat. Beat the eggs in a small bowl then brush the edge of the bottom layer of pastry generously. Lower the second piece over the top then trim any overhanging pastry with a knife. Press firmly and pinch the edges to seal. Brush with beaten egg.Use pastry trimmings to make leaves or holly berries with which to decorate your pie then press them into place. Brush with more beaten egg and rest the pie in the fridge for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6, placing a baking sheet in the oven to get hot. Carefully put the chilled pie, on its tart-tin base, on top of the hot baking sheet and bake for about 50 minutes till golden. Let the pie rest for 10 minutes before serving.While the pie bakes, prepare the sauce. Cut the clementine in half and squeeze the juice into a saucepan. Remove and discard the flesh then cut the peel into very fine strips, as thin as you can. Add these to the juice, then stir in the cranberries, marsala and jelly. Bring to the boil, immediately lower the heat then serve with the rested pie.Nigel Slater is the Observer’s food writerI love the combination of hot charred bread and aniseed butter with the rich, smoky, whipped cod roe.

Once the ingredients are mixed, add the oil gradually while continuing to whisk to emulsify (as you would with mayonnaise). Stop when you have 100ml of oil to go. Now add the water – this will lighten the mix and alter the colour. Whisk in the remaining oil and salt. The mix should be nice and moussey. Transfer into a piping bag and make a 1.5cm cut at the end, or use equivalent nozzle.For the fennel butter, sweat the fennel in the oil, until soft. Add the fennel seeds and chilli and cook for 1 minute. Add the Pernod and cook on full heat for another minute. Now add the water. When the fennel mixture is boiling, gradually add the cold butter. Add the salt, then cool a little and strain.To assemble, toast the bread – ideally on a charcoal grill, but a domestic grill will work or on top of a toaster. Once toasted, brush liberally with the fennel butter. Pipe or spoon on the whipped roe.

The message for the politicians is for them to be tough on human rights and we have to defend democracy in the best way.”Guardiola praised Sterling. “He’s an incredible person,” he said. “It’s tough to understand today what happened to black people in all history. You have to protect them, how equal we are, all together. It’s tough in the 21st century to still be in this position. To have problems with ersity.Sterling has explained why he feels it is important to speak publicly about important issues.“I’m about sharing so that stuff that has happened to me could help someone else as well,” he told the Glass Magazine. “There was a time when I tried to hold stuff back but I know now that there is a 15-year-old boy just like Raheem, or a girl just like Raheem, that will go through these things and hopefully hearing these things from me and not keeping it to myself will help.“I’d like to know I could have helped someone else that is going through something similar. Not everyone is the same but I want to help them along their journey, that’s what I want to do. I always think of the kids from the next generation, you know the kids from London or Manchester or wherever they’re from.”On Wednesday City play Hoffenheim in their final Champions League group game in the midst of an injury crisis. David Silva will be out a for “few weeks” and Fernandinho is also injured, along with Danilo. Sergio Agüero, Kevin De Bruyne and Benjamin Mendy remain out and this has left Guardiola with 15 fit players. “Sergio may be back at the weekend,” he said.City need a point to guarantee their passage to the knockout stage as the group winners. They are aiming to bounce back from Saturday’s first league defeat of the season at Chelsea.Guardiola said: “It’s incredible to review the game and how we played considering the huge quality of the opponents. We had an incredible first half except for 18 minutes when there was a little mistake in our movement.“The rest of the game we played with courage. Football is what it is. Sometimes you accept it. We could have avoided the two goals – two mistakes for the first goal and they scored. That can happen when you play against a good team. If you make mistakes against good teams – Champions League teams, Chelsea – always you concede. It’s part of the process and we have to learn.”Leroy Sané has indicated he could soon sign a new contract. “I felt really at home here from day one and of course it is possible,” the Germany forward said. “From the beginning since I arrived here, I am really happy.”City have announced that the 23-year-old goalkeeper Zack Steffen will join in July from Columbus Crew on a four-year contract. The MLS side said the fee for Steffen, who has six USA caps, was “the largest in club history and most ever received by an MLS club for a goalkeeper”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f409f2b0b4c1e8b4bddfb03e0ddd2499921d7e80/0_179_2075_1244/master/2075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73ca4c2a8d5287eec6174d34c5dab3af","title":"paul pogba dropped manchester united manager mourinho","story":"Paul Pogba has been left shocked at being dropped by José Mourinho, with the Manchester United midfielder left out of the starting XI for the past two games against Arsenal and Fulham.The relationship between the midfielder and his manager has been rocky since the start of the season. Yet despite Mourinho having terse words for Pogba privately and publicly, the France international did not expect to be left out of the XI.Pogba did not start the 1-0 victory over Young Boys in the Champions League last month either, coming on as a second-half substitute.He was reinstated for the 2-2 draw at Southampton in the following match but was particularly disappointing. Mourinho afterwards indicated Pogba was one of his players who lacked a “mad dog” spirit and has not started him since.Pogba made a 15-minute appearance against Arsenal but was left on the bench last Saturday against Fulham, the inexperienced Scott McTominay being preferred as a replacement midfielder.Pogba has decided to keep his counsel and train as normal but he may seek to speak to Mourinho if the manager continues to exclude him. The World Cup winner looks set to start Wednesday night’s Champions League game at Villarreal, with multiple changes anticipated given that United have qualified for the knockout stage.“I’m looking for him to play well and to have a good impact in the game and a good impact in the team – a team with many players that don’t have many miles on their legs,” Mourinho said. “A team with some players that are not playing a lot, so I hope that people like Paul and a couple of others that are normally in the team and they have that number of miles that players need to be at that top level, I hope he can have a good impact on the team.”There may also be a start for Eric Bailly after Mourinho spoke with the central defender on Monday to offer assurance he was content with him. Bailly’s start against Arsenal was a first appearance for two months, having fallen out of favour. Despite playing well the Ivorian was then left out against Fulham. Mourinho, though, informed Bailly this was merely to rest him and that if he shows patience more regular football will come.The Valencia manager, Marcelino, worked with Bailly at Villarreal and he said: “I wish nothing but the best for him and I feel his youth will help him through these hard times and he will be very important for United.”Mourinho has said he was surprised but unconcerned by the statement his agent, Jorge Mendes, released on Friday. Mendes said Mourinho was “fully committed to the club” and that United were “very happy” with his client. “It’s Jorge’s statement – it’s not my statement,” Mourinho said. “I didn’t know at all and I didn’t care about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9afd04e596c06eeda590d1de0cf75f0d0d9692a/0_136_3342_2005/master/3342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fa54ba72a0243e295dfc6049d935d40","title":"barcelona v tottenham champions league live","story":"34 min: Eriksen slides a pass through to Son, who skitters away from Vermaelen and finds himself one-on-one with the keeper. He aims for the far corner but Cillersen stands up and makes the save! Son will be disgusted at missing the chance but encouraged by how much Vermaelen is starting to struggle now that Spurs have found some attacking vim.33 min: Kane donks a feeble freekick into the wall.32 min: Vermaelen jumps in rashly on Eriksen just outside the left-hand corner of Barçca box. Freekick to Spurs in a dangerous positions. Kane fancies it ... 30 min: Eriksen is starting to find space. Sissoko feeds him, then the Dane slips the pass wide to the Rose, who has sprinted up to join in the attack. Rose curls a hard and low ball across the face of goal. Son lunges at it but narrowly fails to connect from six yards out! 28 min: Walker-Peters races down the right to offer a useful passing option, which Eriksen takes up. But the defender’s cross is blocked and then Sissoko slips as he tries to regain possession. Then he pulls back an opponent as Barcelona try to launch another counter from inside their own half.27 min: Barcelona continue to do as they please, right up until Alena’s curled shot from 25 yards refuses to dip under the bar.26 min: Rose bursts past Semedo down the right and then crosses towards Kane, who never looked like getting it. The game has mostly passed Kane by so far. 24 min: Eriksen swings in a corner from the right. It’s another inadequate delivery from the midfielder.22 min: Son is down in the centre circle, holding the base of his back. The medics come on to give him a rub. Pochettino might be minded to walk on, too, to give the rest of his players a slap round the chops. They’re not at the races at the moment. 21 min: Dembélé’s freekick is headed clear by Kane.19 min: Lenglet pings a ball wide the Semedo on the right. The Portuguese s clattered by Rose, giving Barcelona a freekick near the corner flag.16 min: Coutinho threatens down the left again but the move breaks down when he slips a pass through to Miranda, who had strayed offside. Meanwhile, the crowd are making plenty of noise as they chant slogans and displays banners such as this:14 min: Munir flicks on a frekick from the left at the near post. It’s wellied clear before Vermaelen can touch it in at the far post. 12 min: Dembélé is having a party. The only way Spurs can get the ball off him is by fouling him. Meanwhile on the right, Coutinho is starting to perk up, too. Walker-Peters has just been booked for tripping him.11 min: Good news for Spurs: PSV have taken a shock lead at Inter. In the unlikely event of the scores remaining the same in both matches, Spurs will go through!. 9 min: Barça are out to hit Spurs again while they’re down. They pour forward, eventually working it to Dembélé at the right-hand corner of the box. He jinks and ducks and tries to bang a low cross into the danger zone, but it’s cut out. 8 min: Guess resting Messi isn’t that much of a mercy when you’ve got players who can do what Dembélé just did. What a strike on the counter! Eriken’s weak freekick from the right was headed clear by Munir. Walker-Peters was shunted off it by Dembélé, who raced 50 yards forward and then duped Winks with a canny feint before firing a cool low shot past Lloris. 6 min: Walker-Peters makes a bright run down the right wing, skipping past one opponent before being tripped by Miranda. That gives Spurs a useful freekick wide on the right. Eriksen will surely cross it in ...5 min: Spurs file back diligently as Barça piece together several passes with making much progress. The hosts have yet to find any sort of groove.3 min: Eriksen and Kane combine at the edge of the home box before the Englishman is crowded out as he tries to get off a shot. 2 min: Spurs spend the first minute in the Barça half without making any gains. Barça then try to take the play into the visitors’ territory but Tottenham prevent them. Sissoko has made a strong start in centra midfield. Before kickoff there is a short and solemn tribute to Josip Lluis Nunez, the former Barcelona president, who has died.The players stride out on to the pitch, with some 4,500 Spurs fans struggling and failing to be heard above some 90,000 locals. Those locals whistle and jeer to drown out the Champions League jingle, too.“It’s a must-win game, of course, it’s like a final,” ays the manager before explaining he has no doubts about Kyle Walker-Peters’ ability to cope with the occasions on what is his Champions League debut. “One and a half years ago he won the U-20 World Cup with England so he has enough experience to play this type of game. He can cope with the pressure of playing in a game like this, that is not a problem. He may perform well or not well but the most important thing is he’s going to be a big player for Tottenham.”There have been several mentions in the buildup to the necessity for Spurs to cope with the sheer size of the pitch at the Camp Nou. According to Barça’s website, it measures 105 metres x 68 metres for Champions League matches. Whereas at Wembley, Spurs’ temporary home, the pitch measures 105 metres x 68 metres. I’m saying they should cope.You’d think they’d know he’s not reading thisHere are the starting lineups from Milan. PSV’s selection suggests they are not treating this as a dead rubber, at least not from the start. “So Barcelona have seven first-choice players left on the bench - what did Valverde say again?” tut-tuts Geoff Saunders. “It is never easy for any team to win at the Nou Camp but surely this side gives Spurs their best ever chance.” Yup.Messi starts on the bench! Hello. Barcelona are not invincible. And yet, the instruction “Beat Barcelona at the Nou Camp” still sounds like one of the lesser-mentioned labours of Hercules or the improbable plot of an action-packed romp starring Harrison Ford. But Tottenham Hotspur must do it today if they are to avoid Champions League doom. Their adventure is sure to make a for a fun watch.To be precise, it is possible that Spurs could advance even without winning here – they need to gain the same result, or better, at the Nou Camp than Internazionale gain at home to PSV. Given that the Dutch have managed one point from their five group matches so far and have nothing to play for but the pleasure of sabotaging the Italians, Mauricio Pochettino’s men have to work on the assumption that only victory will do for them.Barça, meanwhile, can play with the liberating insouciance (or the sloppiness?) of a side that is already guaranteed top spot in the group. Their manager, Ernesto Valverde, has vowed not to field a bunch of reserves and hinted strongly that he will let Lionel Messi make merry again, as he did when giving Spurs the run-around at Wembley. And even if Barça are not at full-strength – owing to injuries and selections – when has it ever been easy to win at the Nou Camp? Even on Spurs’ previous visit there in a bygone era – for the second leg of 1982 Cup Winners’ Cup semi-final, when Barça were ferocious hatchetmen and the match had to be stopped because of a floodlight failure, for goodness sake – Spurs left empty-handed and peeved, on the end of a 1-0 defeat. Today they have a chance to write a new page in their history in BIG BOLD LETTERS. Or this season’s Champions League campaign will be remembered as but a footnote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2feda4adae71ebacf598569e213a521144b6dc18/105_74_3624_2174/master/3624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=559f7829fa3efe4bc3fb3bcebf7a5c78","title":"liverpool v napoli champions league live","story":"33 mins: This time Salah gets away, but his cross hits Albiol.32 mins: “Don’t want to jinx him but Koulibaly has been great,” says Padraig McAuliffe. “Looks like he’s got everything.” He’s one of the most-hyped defenders in Europe for a reason, certainly. He jostles Salah for the ball, and just keeps getting a boot in the way.29 mins: Firmino tries to win the ball from Allan, and the referee thinks that’s a foul too. His decision-making has been pretty poor so far, even if the Van Dijk booking that set his rubbish ball rolling was one of those challenges that might have been anything at all, from play on to red card.27 mins: The ball is hoisted into the area and Ospina comes out to claim, fluffs it, bumps into a combination of Mané and Maksimovic and falls over. The referee awards a ludicrous free-kick, and Ospina rolls around a bit to try to convince people he wasn’t making it all up.26 mins: Salah feeds Firmino, but his sidefooted shot hits Albiol.25 mins: Callejon has the ball on the right, and Insigne escapes from his marker and runs unmarked to the near post. The cross goes to the far, and Van Dijk clears.22 mins: Liverpool have the ball in the net, but Mané, who turns it in, is miles offside.21 mins: After a couple of decisions went against them, the referee gives Liverpool a free kick and the home crowd roars in sarcastic approval.20 mins: The game has calmed down a bit after a madcap opening, though there is still a sense that it is teetering on a precipice.18 mins: Liverpool win a free kick near the right corner flag, and Ruiz comes over to stop them taking it for a while. This might be a test of Liverpool’s self-control as much as anything else.16 mins: Mertens has miraculously recovered, but can expect to be roundly booed for the remainder of the evening.15 mins: Mertens is still receiving treatment. He’s now on his feet and walking gingerly to the touchline. I have no doubt that he will immediately spin and sprint back onto the field.13 mins: Van Dijk slides in to dispossess Mertens with a lovely challenge on halfway, but he catches the Belgian’s shin on the way through and the forward proceeds to roll around several times in mock agony. The Dutchman is booked, and will thus be suspended for Liverpool’s next European game.12 mins: Salah and Koulibaly get in a foot race, and the strength of the defender sees him through.11 mins: Cavani has given PSG the lead in Belgrade.10 mins: Liverpool lift a high pass towards the edge of the Napoli box, and Ospina races out to ing-header clear. That was really quite balletic.9 mins: And another chance! Alexander-Arnold crosses and Milner rises above the significantly taller Maksimovic but heads over!8 mins: And a chance at the other end! Mertens runs down the right and pulls the ball back to the edge of the area, where he hits a first-time effort that curls over the bar!7 mins: Incredible miss! Robertson lifts the ball into the area and Salah is on his own, with Firmino on his own behind him! He only needed to sidefoot it into the net, but he tries to control it, fails and it rolls to Ospina.3 mins: Real danger for Liverpool, but despite several opportunities to do so no Napoli player ever gets round to shooting, and eventually Hamsik’s pass to Callejon is intercepted.3 mins: Lovren and Shaqiri look quite the pair sitting side by side on the bench, with their matching goatees making them look like runners-up in a George Clooney lookalike competition.Preliminaries complete, kick off is but a few moments away.The delay, we’re told, was to ensure that the players here and in Belgrade emerge from their tunnels with complete synchronicity.The players are in the tunnel! They’ve been there for quite a long time already. I’m not sure what’s up. “No patience for nervous fellow Liverpool fans,” writes Hubert O’Hearn. “Europe’s our home garden. 4-1 easily, or my name isn’t Ernest P. Walkover. Oh wait ...”You’ll Never Walk Alone is on, and the countdown has begun.What he said.“I wonder how Lovren is feeling, going from starting in both a Champion’s League final and a World Cup final to being third choice after Gomez and Matip,” muses Rick McGahey. I’m pretty sure he’ll be thinking that people should recognise that he’s one of the best defenders in the world.Now this is how to lay out a dressing-room. Nobody’s putting the wrong jockstrap on by accident here.“The conundrum Klopp has set his side is how to move the ball forward to the good players through a midfield that only passes sideways,” says Ian Copestake. “The answer? Substitute Hendo on 70 minutes when it is still 0-0.” “We arrive here with a little advantage,” says Carlo Ancelotti in a pre-recorded interview with BT Sport. “It will be difficult but I think we have a lot of confidence.” He doesn’t seem to have a lot of confidence in his belief that they have a lot of confidence. He should have said “I know without any doubt whatsoever we have a lot of confidence”. Merely thinking it makes him sound quite doubtful, which is ironic given the context.Still 40 minutes before kick-off and the away end is already packed and in full voice:If anyone is playing Crucial Anfield European Night Drinking Bingo and thus downing a shot every time the word Olympiacos is mentioned on TV, they probably already require medical attention.“Oh my god, there’s two jerseys in the corner of that photo facing the same way,” sobs David Flynn. “Is the kit man a sociopath? Either follow a pattern or don’t mate.”So Lovren is fit, but Matip keeps his place. Klopp praised him pretty highly after the win over Bournemouth, but I think he was widely expected to lose his spot anyway. The team sheets have been handed in, and these are tonight’s key protagonists:I fear Napoli’s one-shirt-this-way, one-shirt-the-other-way shirt-hanging regime may cause confusion among the number-in half of the squad. I’m not sure they’ve thought through the practicalities.And so the stage is set, for another of those Anfield nights. Liverpool sit third in Group C, and must win to have any chance of going through to the knock-out stages. A score of 1-0 or victory by two goals or more will make sure, while any other single-goal victory scoreline would only be enough if Paris St-Germain fail to beat Red Star Belgrade in Serbia, which is a feat that neither Liverpool nor Napoli achieved.Liverpool’s away record in this season’s competition has been pretty miserable, but at home they are a different prospect, last losing in this competition in 2014, 18 unbeaten matches ago (they won 13 of those). Napoli have not won an away match in the Champions League in six attempts (four lost) over two years. Liverpool surely won’t play as poorly as they did in losing to a last-minute goal in Naples, were excellent against an admittedly very poor Bournemouth at the weekend, and will be boosted by the return of a now fully-fit Sadio Mané.“We are in a good moment for weeks and months as a club and a team, we have to use it,” says Jürgen Klopp. “We all know the results we need and it is quite difficult. Napoli are good in possession, counterattack as well, typical Italian team good at defending. It’s a big challenge but if something special is possible it is here and that is why we should try.”It is a worthwhile ambition. Everyone likes special things, and I for one am looking forward to watching one this evening.

VR isn’t strictly necessary, but it wraps the game’s astonishing visuals – glittering forests, neon cityscapes, constellations of lights that move like whales – all around you, helping you sink into the trance-like state of concentration that gives the game its title. The cumulative effect is quite emotionally overwhelming. As a fringe benefit, if you turn out to be one of the players who reports crying at Tetris Effect, the headset will help hide your tears from anyone else in the room.Like Super Mario 64, the game that laid out blueprints for every 3D game to follow, Astro Bot reinvents how the camera works – by attaching it directly to the player’s headset. You’re a physical presence in the world, dodging projectiles, headbutting obstacles and peering round corners while controlling a tiny robot who jumps over gaps and on to the heads of villains. Astro Bot himself might not be as recognisable a mascot as Nintendo’s primary-coloured plumber, but Rescue Mission has the same sense of charm and invention.As thousands of YouTube reaction videos will attest, scaring the life out of people has always been one of VR’s most obvious raisons d’etre. Resident Evil 7 leverages that to create the scariest instalment in the horror series’ history, switching to a first-person perspective and bayou setting that is, at least initially, grounded in reality. The bulk of the game takes place within the grounds of a creepy house in the Louisiana swamps, a horrifyingly convincing space that will stick with you long after the headset is removed.A shooter where time moves only when you do, allowing you to pull off some remarkable action-movie feats. Lean backwards to dodge bullets, or slice them out of the air using a motion-controlled blade. Punch an enemy, grab their pistol as it tumbles through the air, and then use it to explode the head of your next target into red crystals without even looking. The closest you’ll ever come to starring in The Matrix – just make sure you’ve cleared the living room beforehand.VR can be an isolating experience, locking you inside a bulky headset, but this co-operative multiplayer game smartly takes advantage of that. The player in a headset is presented with a virtual bomb that is only visible to them, while in the real world their teammates shuffle desperately through an on-screen manual trying to find the instructions for defusing it. The digital equivalent of a good escape room, right down to the pleasures of yelling “don’t you even know the Greek alphabet?” at someone who used to call you their friend.A fantasy adventure set in a Redwall-esque world where heroic knights are mice in adorable little suits of armour, their trusty steeds are squirrels, and their foes clockwork beetles. The game combines jumping, exploring, combat and puzzles into a sort of bonsai Zelda, as you guide large-eared heroine Quill on her quest through a string of tiny diorama-like scenes. There’s a wonderful sense of scale to the world, which can be surveyed from above or peered at closely to admire the intricate details.An ambitious sci-fi shooter that succeeds by putting the emphasis on the physicality of its arsenal. It’s not just a case of aiming and pulling the trigger, but also slamming a clip into the bottom of your pistol to reload, or pumping the next round into the chamber of your imaginary shotgun. You can pick between four character classes, each with their own signature weapon – including a futuristic bow and laser sword – and unlockable abilities. Movement is limited to point-and-click teleporting in order to avoid motion sickness, but given the minor workout each firefight already offers, that’s probably for the best.This quietly gothic fairytale about schoolchildren in a Victorian orphanage is unexpected and weird. You play a fairy that these children are attempting to befriend, existing in between moments in time and giving the events of each frozen vignette a subtle nudge. VR steeps you in the game’s unique atmosphere – as delicate as the filigree of a fairy’s wing, but with a subtly sinister edge – which is the real reason to play.Less a game than a set of brilliant toys that showcase the silly slapstick potential of VR. As the title suggests, it’s a faithful recreation of modern workplaces … as devised by robots from the year 2050, whose understanding of human civilisation suggests the whole thing has been described to them second-hand. This creates an air of Douglas Adams-ish comedy perfectly in line with your own bumbling attempts, flailing around with motion controllers, to photocopy documents and construct sandwiches.Once upon a time, the Liverpudlian-developed anti-gravity racer Wipeout – think Mario Kart set in a gleaming neon future, with missiles instead of banana skins – was the cutting edge of the original PlayStation’s lineup. Omega Collection restores the sense of speed and, occasionally, vertigo you might remember from those days, dropping you right in the cockpit of a ship – you then race along tracks that loop up and over themselves, or drop at sudden 90-degree angles. That can, naturally, lead to some motion sickness – so if you’re susceptible, it might be best saved until you’ve found your VR legs.VR’s initial promise might have been the chance to live inside a realistic simulation, but one of its best applications has actually turned out to be abstract rhythm games – and there’s none better than Beat Saber. The game arms you with two of the Skywalker clan’s weapons of choice, which you use to slice colour-coded blocks in time with the music. It’s like being inside a particularly intense Guitar Hero track, as you bounce, swing, sweat and forget how ludicrous you must look to the outside world.For more recommendations, see our picks for the best PlayStation 4 games and the best games of 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c19bdedb9cb65c825d98c8503d623ec4821b48/0_322_3474_2084/master/3474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6345f53643a3d49b71edf8c7e6d1bb66","title":"the best apps for family bliss","story":"A selection of games, tools and platforms to help family life run that bit smootherWith junk food available on every street, it’s never been more important for children to get to grips with home cooking and proper nutrition.

My Nokia 3210, unveiled the previous year, was state of the art. Competitively priced, lightweight (we thought) … there were even different coloured covers!Fast-forward 18 years and my daughter Alice – 12, new to phone ownership and not easily impressed – is examining this piece of communication history. In her first year of secondary school, with her interests and independence growing fast, Alice uses a smartphone to communicate with friends, organise activities, listen to music and take photos, as well as to contact and be contacted by us.In recent years, parents of communication-hungry tweens faced a predicament: offer their child a smartphone with unfettered access to the world wide web (and everything that comes with it) or pick up an older phone, with limitations imposed by more primitive technology. Now, thankfully, there’s a third way.Alice will be comparing the Nokia with the Verve IMO S2 with monqi – a new phone exclusive to Tesco Mobile, and designed specifically for children and young teenagers easing into mobile technology. How will it and the classic Nokia shape up in her fickle fingers?First up, the Nokia 3210.“It’s really heavy,” she exclaims. “The screen is tiny. It looks old.” She is examining the handset with the sort of sceptical curiosity she might extend towards a fax machine, or acarrier pigeon.“I guess you could call people and text them,” shesays. “Very slowly,” she adds, noticing the three-letters-per-key setup. No emojis. That’s not good. Her face briefly brightens as she spots the hash key. “Wait. What did you actually use that for back then?”The lack of a camera bothers her even more than the no internet access, presumably because the latter is available via our home computer. Not being able to listen to music is another shortcoming.With her reaction so far fairly scathing, it is time to reveal the phone’s killer feature: Snake! This, initially at least, is a hit. “That’s quite good!” she decides, setting about the game. Her initial enthusiasm proves short-lived. “Actually, it’s pretty boring.”Asked when the phone might have been designed, Alice hazards a guess at 1990. At almost triple her lifetime ago, that is ancient history for her.Does the 3210 have “old skool” appeal perhaps? “No,” she says firmly. “Retro is good in clothes, but not in phones.”Case closed. On to the IMO S2 with monqiThis, it would seem, is more like it. “It looks nice. It feels smooth to hold and use and it has a good-size screen – not too big or too small,” says Alice, back in her comfort zone.First of all she checks out the photo options, pulling a series of silly selfie faces. There are two cameras, I tell her, peering at the manual. “Of course there are, front and back,” she says, raising an eyebrow at my ignorance.“It’s really easy to work out,” she says, connecting to the wifi and starting to browse the website of a clothing brand she covets. As well as online window shopping, Alice uses her phone to watch clips from favourite films and musicals, to research and help with homework (foreign language dictionaries for example), and to stream music and contact friends via – parent approved – social media.She makes the odd phone call too, mainly to me, often to ask if she can go to a friend’s, and frequently followed by a call to request a lift home.Taking photos is a favourite pastime, and Alice likes the editing features on the IMO S2. She quickly starts to play around with tints and effects, writing captions and adding characters to her pictures.Intrinsic to the IMO S2 is the monqi operating system, which enables parents – having installed the parent app on their own phones – to monitor and shape how the child’s phone is used.Functions include: setting time limits on usage (remote shut down at homework or dinner time, for instance), blocking unsuitable internet content (monqi’s bespoke browser has built-in filters), monitoring internet and phone usage in real time, and checking on whereabouts. There is also a family chat option – a controlled alternative to third-party messenger apps.“Parental controls are a good idea, especially for younger children when you definitely want to know they are only seeing appropriate things,” says Alice, as she scrolls through the monqi functions.She admits that time limits make sense too. “Especially at first it’s good to make sure it isn’t being used all the time. I do lots of other activities, which keep me busy, but it can sometimes be tempting to have my phone on too long, especially if lots of group conversations are going on.”Having a smartphone has been helpful for settling into secondary school, she says – facilitating new friendships and enabling her to keep in touch with old classmates too.“A smartphone makes it easy to swap numbers and send a message or join a chat with your school friends,” says Alice. “With an old-style phone you would have to call someone direct, and that would feel more daunting,” she adds.The monqi system ensures this is all done safely new contacts are approved through the parent app, so mums and dads get a chance to check they are legitimate and appropriate.The IMO S2 meets with Alice’s approval. “Your parents look after you, and this setup is another way of them doing that. I’d be very happy to have this phone,” she says.Although used to tales of her parents’ seemingly prehistoric analogue childhoods, her foray into early mobile phones has given her a new sense of how technology has changed. “It has made me really appreciate how much we can do now.”Not having today’s smartphone technology would make her life more complicated, she says. “I think we are very lucky today. Maybe those early phones were ok for someone older,” she says in a placatory tone, looking straight at me.I think we have a winner.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896450882ebe852943fe6091e587c189199152/0_72_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47fc95829c1d7604f2df0a51ea6be8b2","title":"i feel more independent one 11 year old on her first year with a phone","story":"Amelia, aged 11, from Bristol shares her experiences of phone ownership – from the ‘contract’ she signed with her parents to getting lost on the way to schoolI finally got a phone last September, just as I started secondary school. I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

The racist abuse of Raheem Sterling at Chelsea is not somehow The Sun’s fault. We hope those allegedly responsible get what they deserve.“We hugely admire Sterling’s talent. Our coverage of his off-field behaviour has nothing to do with skin colour.“The suggestion is ridiculous and offensive — and the idea it inspired racists is baseless. His media mates should engage their brains before dishing out accusations without a shred of evidence.”However, the Sun’s chief sports writer Dave Kidd used his column to say that Sterling’s comments had prompted him to reconsider how young black players are covered, saying that he has “felt uneasy” with some aspects of how Sterling has been covered, and warning that football journalism is not an ethnically erse industry.A Chelsea fan pictured shouting insults at Sterling during the match has lost his job over the incident but insists he was not shouting racist abuse.Sterling’s relationships, decision to get a gun tattoo and other aspects of his private life have been repeatedly covered by newspapers in recent years, with the player saying his white teammates are not subject to the same level of scrutiny. Last year a man was jailed after subjecting the player to a racist attack outside his club’s training ground.The player used an Instagram post on Saturday to compare the headlines on two MailOnline stories about young Manchester City players who both bought their mothers a home after securing a lucrative contract.A story about black player Tosin Adarabioyo ran under the headline ‘Young Manchester City footballer, 20, on £25,000 a week splashes out on mansion on market for £2.25m despite having never started a Premier League match’, while a similar story about white teenage midfielder Phil Foden carried the simpler headline: ‘Foden buys new £2m home for his mum’.The story threatened to spread further as Bournemouth player Tyrone Mings announced he was pulling out of a planned interview with radio station TalkSport – which is owned by the same company as the Sun – in protest at its coverage of the incident.“I’m meant to be doing an interview with TalkSport tomorrow, which won’t be happening,” he said. “I’m fed up of broadcasting channels who have a huge voice allowing this sort of shit to be said. Like someone or dislike them, there is no ‘but’ or grey area when it comes to racism.”“I will absolutely voice my opinion and play my part for those who do not have as much of a reach. It has to be in the right way and on the right platforms though. Silence is deadly for stations and outlets who rely on viewers and listeners.”Mings was reacting to a TalkSport clip featuring former Reading striker Dave Kitson, who suggested that Sterling’s old Instagram posts may have antagonised the public.“We have a duty of care to ourselves as footballers to be a little bit careful with social media and the way we portray ourselves,” said Kitson, who suggested Sterling’s decision to upload pictures of his new homes and new cars was “going to antagonise people”.“That is no excuse whatsoever for racially abusing someone but you sow a seed among people who are not racists not to like that particular person because they don’t want to see that in their faces every single day.”Former Fulham player Leroy Rosenior later called in to challenge Kitson on air."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fca376c1d92ebedceeaf5c40f665aeee13204d3d/0_567_8510_5107/master/8510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc20bece7c84636f2047b18a3e52e60","title":"avicii true stories documentary levan tsikurishvili","story":"Avicii: True Stories was initially given a small release before the death of the EDM star but now the director discusses its uneasy relevanceThe man who got as close as anyone could to the superstar musician Avicii still has no explanation for why he died six months ago. “I have this feeling of unreality,” says Levan Tsikurishvili, who spent four years filming the DJ for a documentary. “I’m still in shock. I don’t have a clear reason.”But his film offers a startling number of clues. Avicii: True Stories, which will debut on Netflix in the US, UK and Australia on 28 December, presents an unflinching portrait of an artist coming apart. With fly-on-the-wall proximity, the camera shows Avicii repeatedly, and emphatically, telling everyone around him how exhausted, anxious and sick he is. “There was never an end to the shows, even when I hit a wall,” the DJ says early in the film. “My life is all about stress.”“He’s a shell of what he used to be,” says a friend in the film, while another describes him as “a ticking timebomb”.It all builds to the point where, late in the documentary, Avicii flatly says of touring: “It will kill me.”Eventually, he did do something about it. At the end of 2016, Avicii fired his manager and retired from the road. The film positions that decision as its happy ending. It culminates with scenes of a tanned Avicii on a tranquil beach in Madagascar, planning a less stressful future by sticking to just producing music in the studio.The director admits that this ending now seems chillingly false. Of course, it read very differently in October 2017, when the film had a very limited, initial release. It only ran in Scandinavian movie theaters and on Netflix in western Europe, buttressed by a single showing in select US theaters. Just six months later, Avicii died and while details weren’t confirmed, his family said he “could not go on any longer”. He was 28.Because of that whiplash turn of events, rumors swirled that Netflix had abruptly pulled the film. But, according to Tsikurishvili, “the film was never supposed to have a wider release back then. What happened was that people tried to watch the movie in the US and UK and couldn’t find it. So, they ran with the story that it had been pulled.”The documentary’s new, wide release will inevitably invite a forensic scrutiny. Even the director says he now sees the film “in a very different way. Watching it, I felt everything you can think of. It was a very emotional experience.”Especially since Tsikurishvili and Avicii had bonded so deeply during their marathon filming sessions. The director first met the DJ, who was born Tim Bergling, six years ago at a dinner in their mutual home city of Stockholm. The musician asked the director to helm a documentary about a charity project he had started which donated $1m to African hunger programs. “It clicked from the beginning,” Tsikurishvili said of their relationship.Neither he nor Avicii had any preconceived notions of what the focus of the documentary would be. But they did know they already had a dramatic story to tell. In his early 20s, the DJ had gone from sleeping on people’s couches to becoming a superstar artist, generating tens of millions of dollars while headlining festivals around the world. A key figure in his rise was his manager at the time, Ash Pournouri, who comes off in the film as savvy and dedicated, but also driven to the point of obsession. Avicii’s talent gave Pournouri plenty to work with.His doctors compounded the problem by enabling a dependence on drugs. They wrote scores of prescriptions for opioids such as Percocet and gabapentin. In the film, Avicii responds by shrugging: “I guess they know what they’re doing.”His passivity bled into his relationship with the business. For much of the film, Avicii lets his manager drive him. “I didn’t take the time to think about what I really wanted to do,” he says. “I just went along with the flow. I was running after an ideal happiness that wasn’t my own.”In the film, even his manager admits that “Tim is going to die, with all the interviews, radio tours and playing. He’ll drop dead.” (Pournouri did not respond to an interview request for this article.)Beyond his exhaustion, it seems Avicii suffered from a kind of social anxiety, which was greatly exacerbated by the demands of fame. “I don’t think he knew what it takes to be as successful as he became,” the director says. “He was never comfortable as the center of attention. He felt stardom is something that human beings have made up. It’s nothing real.”In the footage, Avicii quotes Carl Jung’s insights about introversion, a characteristic he deeply identified with. “I prefer intuition to sensation,” he says.Another source of pressure concerned Avicii’s feeling of obligation to financially support his management team. “He never wanted to do anything to someone else that would cause any problems,” Tsikurishvili says. “He felt responsibility to take care of his co-workers.”Much like Tom Petty, who stayed on the road despite severe health and pain issues, Avicii paid a heavy price for that sense of obligation. The breaking point came before a string of shows in Las Vegas which Avicii felt he had to cancel. Despite his insistence on backing out, Pournouri grouses on camera that the DJ “doesn’t understand the value of money”.As to why the star wanted so uncensored a documentary to be released, the director can only speculate. “All of us, in one way or another, want to share our own stories of who we are and where we come from,” he says. “Tim was such an honest person. He was so honest about himself.”While Tsikurishvili says he never discussed the specifics of the film with its star, he says the last thing Avicii told him, when they met last December, was that he thought the film was great.The director adds: “The documentary gives a very close explanation of how he felt. I’m happy and thankful that we were able to put so many of his years on film, to show others how he really was. As a collaborator, and a film-maker, that’s what I can do for him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e863b0d9f805a2efebfb0767f41845fd92dee0a3/1648_215_6102_3661/master/6102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f85fee9f839bc80156a8ddcecc4865e","title":"nick cave cultural boycott israel brian eno","story":"Musician says boycott is ‘partly the reason I am playing Israel – to stand against those who shame and silence musicians’Nick Cave has elaborated on his stance regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, calling the cultural boycott of Israel “cowardly and shameful”.Cave played a pair of concerts in Tel Aviv in November 2017 with his band the Bad Seeds, and received criticism from artists who oppose Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories and refuse to perform in the country. Writing on his website in an answer to a question from a fan, Cave posted an email he had sent to Brian Eno, one of the artists promoting the boycott.“I do not support the current government in Israel, yet do not accept that my decision to play in the country is any kind of tacit support for that government’s policies,” Cave wrote, adding that he supported the Palestinian cause and that Palestinian suffering “is ended via a comprehensive and just solution, one that involves enormous political will on both sides”. He also highlighted his own charity work that raised £150,000 for the pro-Palestine Hoping Foundation.He also said the boycott “is partly the reason I am playing Israel – not as support for any particular political entity but as a principled stand against those who wish to bully, shame and silence musicians”, and that the boycott “risks further entrenching positions in Israel in opposition to those you support”.Artists opposing him should “go to Israel and tell the press and the Israeli people how you feel about their current regime,” he said, “then do a concert on the understanding that the purpose of your music was to speak to the Israeli people’s better angels … Perhaps the Israelis would respond in a wholly different way than they would to just yet more age-old rejectionism.”Cave added a note saying Eno was his hero, responsible for “some of the most important and essential recordings I have ever heard. So, if there seems to be a thread of anguish that runs through this letter, this is indeed the case.” But he reiterated that Eno was “weaponising” music, adding: “What has brought us to the point where certain musicians feel it is ethically sound to use forms of coercion and intimidation, in the form of ‘open’ letters, on fellow musicians who don’t agree with their point of view? … I simply could not treat my Israeli fans with the necessary contempt to do Brian Eno’s bidding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef9a6180b6999a5fcc157ccb3f4317890409e9d/0_115_1818_1091/master/1818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5f9790d286046077b26a22118cafa14","title":"swing ting manchester rave club scene","story":"With its blend of dancehall, afro bashment, UK funky and experimentalism, Swing Ting has spent 10 years ersifying Manchester’s club scene‘Third Saturday of the month, it’s Swing Ting. I’m gonna pay a fiver. I don’t give a shit who’s playing,” Ruben Platt states, illustrating the attitude of the Manchester club night’s clientele. He’s drinking tea with fellow party co-founder Balraj Samrai at a cafe between industrial Ancoats, where their studio is, and the Northern Quarter, where they’ll later open doors for the basement rave. The former area is undergoing gentrification whereas the latter has been transformed by it already. As Swing Ting approaches its 10th birthday, they’ve learned what to change and what should stay the same in order to hold their corner.They’ve maintained a monthly residency in Soup Kitchen’s 200-capacity basement since summer 2011. It’s barebones inside: down the steps and on to the floor, the room is wide and shallow with hard ground. Minimal seating lines the far side, next to a grungy bathroom you could easily miss in the dark. The venue has a habit of tweaking things, so today there’s reddish lighting and new subs in the soundsystem, but the bar is crammed into its usual alcove. The stripped-back nature of the spot allows the friendly dancehall party, and their motley crew of dancers, to cultivate their own vibe of smiles, wines and gunfingers.In town with a fairly central location and cheap, on-the-door tickets, Swing Ting attracts plenty of walk-ins along with its regular crowd of millennials, students and delegates from Manchester’s disparate music scenes. Samrai recalls that this wasn’t always the case: “When we put bassline on the flyer – bashment, dancehall, hip-hop and garage – most of the time alarm bells were ringing for people. It was different in town back then, very segmented.” The club has a reputation for hiring nicer bouncers than most, and Platt suggests the recent surge of interest in dancehall and reggaeton has also helped people feel welcome inside.But Swing Ting has always been about bringing different groups and scenes together. Samrai and Platt met while studying in the city in 2006, and like so many others in the UK underground, their time at university would prove formative. They’d go to clubs to socialise: funk, soul and bass night Friends and Family at dancehallreggae night Hot Milk they’d meet Joey B, who’d later become a Swing Ting resident they’d trek to Subdub at Leeds West Indian Centre to understand the importance of the soundsystem. They formed links with a wave of Mancunian talent: Jon K, Illum Sphere and Jonny Dub who would run the cutting-edge club night Hoya:Hoya, Italo-disco connoisseur Il Bosco, and Boomkat’s head experimental enthusiast Conor Thomas. “Dancehall, electronica, experimental, but with Fat City’s soul-funk legacy,” Samrai puts it, explaining how Swing Ting would tie all of this together in sound and audience.The crew’s resident DJs reflect the party’s open approach to mixing – a rare attitude around the time of its inception. Samrai and Platt are fascinated with well-engineered soundsystem music, which lends itself well to their continuous, fluid blends. Joey B packs dubplates in abundance, though tonight he also reaches for a new Tyga track. Murlo’s silky electronic riddims bridge gaps between the genres. Then there’s Fox, the singjaying host and crowd favourite. Most importantly, the crowd can trust the crew to fill in for each other, with every member bringing flavours from all across the Swing Ting spectrum. “We have enough not-residents-but-basically-residents that we could just book them on a rotation,” Platt admits, speaking to close crew such as Brackles, Florentino and Hipsters Don’t Dance as well as kindred spirits across the Atlantic like the Large, Jubilee and Dre Skull.Structure of the nights is flexible and Samrai relishes the slow burn of warming up: “We’ve had some wicked nights where it’s got to half one, maybe even two, and the tempo’s not gone above 110bpm. It sets it up so well for the guests, cos they can just come in and smash it.” Tonight’s headliner is Bamz, a producer and DJ known for handling the decks on tour for rapper Nadia Rose. The residents tee up Dave’s Funky Friday which she obliterates with Giggs’ Whippin’ Excursion, before shelling down UK funky remixes of chart hits, true to the formula. “It’s good reflecting on it afterwards,” Samrai says. “I think Murlo was saying, ‘what happened to the garage warm-up sets?’ and we were like, ‘oh, yeah’ – I guess we’ve got so many afro-bashment bangers to play, you just get lost in that.”Early, pre-Soup Kitchen DIY days saw Samrai and Platt carting hired decks and a soundsystem between house parties, student spots and Charlie’s karaoke bar in Chinatown. Holding down a solid venue helped them find time to develop as a studio production unit and launch a label arm to keep Manchester at the forefront of club music. They’ve amassed an international network with the likes of Jamaica’s Equiknoxx crew and have sought to consciously ersify their bookings in recent years, supporting more women and black artists to better represent street rave in its rawest form. Swing Ting began with “no mission beyond being a really fun time” as Platt puts it, though the pair agree there’s always something to improve. “We’re finding that our audience are starting to grow up a little bit more and come out less often,” Samrai muses. “It asks questions: Do you wanna appeal to younger people? Do you wanna have a different generation heading things up and taking things forward? And maybe we can set up a cafe somewhere …”But if tonight is anything to go by, Swing Ting aren’t moving any time soon once again a kaleidoscopic crowd of cavorting Mancs keeps the residents at work after closing time, basslines bubbly and bright even as the lights come on.“This one has been played nearly every session since its creation in early 2013. It was an anthem at the party before finally being released on Fox’s Musik EP in 2016.”“We love this riddim from the funky bashment era which coincided with us first starting the night – it’s stood the test of time neatly.

It was early morning in early summer, and I was tracing my way through the woods of central North Carolina, steering cautiously around S-curves and braking hard when what looked like a small rise turned into a narrow bridge. I was on my way to meet Tami McGraw, who lives with her husband and the youngest of their kids in a sprawling development of old trees and wide lawns just south of Chapel Hill. Before I reached her, McGraw emailed. She wanted to feed me when I got there.“Would you like to try emu?” she asked. “Or perhaps some duck?”These are not normal breakfast offerings. But for years, nothing about McGraw’s life has been normal. She cannot eat beef or pork, or drink milk or eat cheese or snack on a gelatine-containing dessert without feeling her throat close and her blood pressure drop. Wearing a wool sweater raises hives on her skin inhaling the fumes of bacon sizzling on a stove will knock her to the ground. Everywhere she goes, she carries an array of tablets that can beat back an allergy attack, and an auto-injecting EpiPen that can jolt her system out of anaphylactic shock.McGraw is allergic to the meat of mammals and everything else that comes from them: dairy products, wool and fibre, gelatine from their hooves, char from their bones. This syndrome affects thousands of people in the US and an uncertain but likely larger number worldwide, and after a decade of research, scientists have begun to understand what causes it. It is created by the bite of a tick, picked up on a hike or brushed against in a garden, or hitchhiking on the fur of a pet that was roaming outside.The illness, which generally goes by the name “alpha-gal allergy” after the component of meat that triggers it, is a trial that McGraw and her family are still learning to cope with. In much the same way, medicine is grappling with it, too. Allergies occur when our immune systems perceive something that ought to be familiar as foreign. For scientists, alpha-gal is forcing a remapping of basic tenets of immunology: how allergies occur, how they are triggered, whom they put in danger and when.For those affected, alpha-gal is transforming the landscapes they live in, turning the reliable comforts of home – the plants in their gardens, the food on their plates – into an uncertain terrain of risk.In 1987, Dr Sheryl van Nunen was confronted with a puzzle. She was the head of the allergy department at a regional hospital in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia, and had a reputation among her colleagues for sorting out mysterious episodes of anaphylaxis. This time, a man had been sent to see her who kept waking up, in the middle of the night, in the grip of some profound reaction.Van Nunen knew at once that this was out of the ordinary, since most allergic reactions happen soon after exposure, rather than hours later. She also knew that only a few allergens affect people after they have gone to bed. (Latex, for instance – someone sensitive to it who has sex using a latex condom might fall asleep and wake up in the midst of an allergy attack.) She checked the man for the obvious irritants and, when those tests came up negative, took a thorough look at his medical history and did a skin test for everything he had eaten and touched in the hours before bedtime. The only potential allergen that returned a positive result was meat.This was weird (and dismaying, in barbecue-loving Australia). But it was the only such case Van Nunen had ever seen. She coached the patient on how to avoid the meals that seemed to be triggering his reactions, put it down to the unpredictability of the human immune system, and moved on.Then a few more such patients came her way. There were six others during the 1990s by 2003, she had seen at least 70, all with the same problem, all apparently affected by meat they had eaten a few hours before. Groping for an explanation, she lengthened the list of questions she asked, quizzing the patients about whether they or their families had ever reacted to anything else: detergents, fabrics, plants in their gardens, insects on the plants.“And invariably, these people would say to me: ‘I haven’t been bitten by a bee or a wasp, but I’ve had lots of tick bites,’” Van Nunen recalls.As she remembers it, Tami McGraw’s symptoms began after 2010. That was the year she and her husband, Tom, a retired surgeon, spied a housing bargain in North Carolina, a development next to a nature reserve whose builder had priced the big houses to sell. The leafy spread of streams and woodland pockets was everything she wanted in a home. She didn’t realise that it offered everything that deer and birds and rodents – the main hosts of ticks – want as well.She remembers one tick that attached to her scalp, raising such a welt that the spot was red for months afterwards, and a swarm of baby ticks that climbed her legs and had to be scrubbed off in a hot bath laced with bleach. Unpredictably, at odd intervals, she began to feel dizzy and sick.“I’d have unexplained allergic reactions, and I’d break out in hives and my blood pressure would go crazy,” she told me. The necklines of all her T-shirts were stretched, because she tugged at them to relieve the feeling that she couldn’t take a deep breath. She trekked to an array of doctors who diagnosed her with asthma or early menopause or a tumour on her pituitary gland. They prescribed antibiotics and inhalers and steroids. They sent her for MRI scans, pulmonary function tests, echocardiograms of her heart. Nothing yielded a result.Looking back, she realises she missed clues as to the source of her problem. She always seemed to need to use an asthma inhaler on Wednesdays – the day she spent hours in her car, delivering steaming-hot dinners for meals on wheels. She would feel short of breath, and need to visit an urgent-care clinic, on Saturdays – which always started, in her household, with a big breakfast of eggs and sausages.Then a close friend had a scary episode: after going for a run, she arrived home and passed out on the hot concrete of her driveway. Once the friend had recovered, McGraw quizzed her. Her friend said: “They thought I got stung by a bee while I was running. But now they think maybe I have a red-meat allergy.”McGraw remembers her first reaction: that’s crazy. But her second was: maybe I have that too. She did some searching online, and then asked her doctor to order a little-known blood test that would show if her immune system was reacting to a component of mammal meat. The test result was so strongly positive that her doctor called her at home to tell her to step away from the stove.The test launched her on an odyssey of discovering just how much mammal material is present in everyday life. One time, she took capsules of liquid painkiller and woke up in the middle of the night, itching and covered in hives provoked by the drug’s gelatine covering.When she bought an unfamiliar lip balm, the lanolin in it made her mouth peel and blister. She planned to spend an afternoon gardening, spreading fertiliser and planting flowers, but passed out on the grass and had to be revived with an EpiPen. She had reacted to manure and bone meal that had been added as enrichments to the bagged compost she had bought.She struggled with the attacks’ unpredictability, and even more with the impact on her family. “I think I’m getting better, and then I realise I’m not,” she says. “It’s just that I’m more knowledgable about what I can and can’t do.”The discovery of new diseases often follows a pattern. Scattered patients realise they are experiencing strange symptoms. They find each other, face to face in a neighbourhood or across the world on the internet. They bring their experience to medicine, and medicine is sceptical. And then, after a period of pain and recalcitrance, medicine admits that, in fact, the patients were right.That is the story of the discovery of CFSME and Lyme disease, among others. But it is not the story of alpha-gal allergy. An odd set of coincidences brought this bizarre illness to the attention of researchers almost as soon as it occurred.The story begins with a cancer drug called cetuximab, which came on to the market in 2004. Cetuximab is a protein grown in cells taken from mice. For any new drug, there are likely to be a few people that react badly to it, and that was true for cetuximab. In its earliest trials, one or two of every 100 cancer patients who had it infused into their veins had a hypersensitive reaction: their blood pressure dropped and they had difficulty breathing.The manufacturers, ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb, checked every obvious thing about the trial: the drug’s ingredients, the cleanliness of the manufacturing plants, even the practices at the medical centres where cetuximab had been administered. Nothing stood out. The most that researchers could guess at the time was that the recipients might have some kind of mouse allergy.Then the first coincidence occurred: a nurse whose husband worked at the Bentonville clinic mentioned the death to Dr Tina Hatley, an immunologist in private practice in Bentonville. Hatley had recently finished postgraduate training at the University of Virginia’s allergy centre, and she mentioned the death to her former supervisor, Dr Thomas Platts-Mills.The bad responses to the drug looked like allergic reactions, and they were common enough – and far enough from the manufacturer’s expectations – to be an intriguing research opportunity.Platts-Mills pulled together a team, looping in Hatley and several current research fellows as well. Fairly quickly, they discovered the source of the problem. People were reacting to the drug because they had a pre-existing sensitivity, indicated by a high level of antibodies (called immunoglobulin E, or IgE for short), to a sugar that is present in the muscles of most mammals, though not in humans or other primates. The name of the sugar was galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, known for short as alpha-gal.Alpha-gal is familiar to many scientists because it is responsible for an enduring disappointment: its tendency to trigger intense immune reactions is the reason that organs taken from animals have never successfully been transplanted into people. The puzzle was why the drug recipients were reacting to it. To have an allergic reaction, someone needs to have been primed with a prior exposure to a substance – but the trial recipients who reacted badly were all on their first dose of cetuximab.Team members scrutinised the patients and their families for anything that could explain the problem. The reactions appeared regional – patients in Arkansas and North Carolina and Tennessee experienced the hypersensitivity, but ones in Boston and northern California did not. They investigated parasites, moulds and diseases that occur only in pockets of the US such as rural Tennessee.The question then became: what in rural Tennessee could trigger a reaction like this? The answer arose from a second coincidence. Dr Jacob Hosen, a researcher in Platts-Mills’s lab, stumbled across a map drawn by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing the prevalence of an infection called Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It exactly overlapped the hot spots where the cetuximab reactions had occurred.Rocky Mountain spotted fever is transmitted by the bite of a tick: Amblyomma americanum, one of the most common ticks in the south-eastern US. It’s known as the lone star tick because of the blotch of white that appears on the back of the female’s body.The researchers wondered – if the mystery reactions shared a footprint with a disease, and ticks caused the disease, could ticks be linked to the reactions, too?It was an intriguing hypothesis, and was reinforced by a new set of patients who came trickling into Platts-Mills’s clinic at about the same time. They were all adults, and that was odd to start with, because allergies tend to show up in childhood. They had never had an allergic reaction before, but now they were experiencing allergy symptoms: swelling, hives and, in the worst cases, anaphylactic shock. They too had high levels of IgE antibodies to alpha-gal.Meat from mammals inevitably contains alpha-gal – so in already sensitised iniduals, eating meat may constitute a second exposure, in the same way infusing cetuximab had been.If tick bites had sensitised them, then the alpha-gal reaction might be a food allergy as well as a drug reaction. But the connection was speculative, and cementing cause and effect would take one final, extraordinary coincidence.As it happens, Platts-Mills likes to hike. One weekend he took off across the central Virginia hills, tramping through grassy underbrush. He came home five hours later, peeled off his boots and socks, and found that his legs and feet were speckled with tiny dots. They looked like ground pepper, but were dug into his skin – he had to use a dull knife to scrape them off – and they itched fiercely. He saved a few, and sent them to an entomologist. They were the larval form of lone star ticks.This, he realised, was an opportunity. When he returned to the lab, he had his team draw his blood and check his IgE levels. They were low to start with, and then week by week began to climb. Platts-Mills is British – his father was an MP – and in the midst of having his IgE tracked, he went to an event at the Royal Society of Medicine in London. “And at that point,” he says cheerfully, “I ate two lamb chops and drank two glasses of wine.”In the middle of the night, he woke up covered in hives.The lone star tick doesn’t receive much attention in the US. It’s the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, that has the dubious honour of being the most well-known, as it’s the carrier of Lyme disease, which causes an estimated 300,000 cases of illness in the US each year. The lone star tick doesn’t transmit Lyme disease, but is the vector for other serious illnesses, including Q fever, ehrlichiosis, Heartland virus, Bourbon virus and tularaemia, an infection so serious that the US government classifies the bacteria that cause it as a potential agent of bioterrorism.While Lyme clusters in the north-east and the northern midwest US, diseases carried by Amblyomma stretch from the coast of Maine to the tip of Florida, the Atlantic to the middle of Texas, and the southern shores of the Great Lakes all the way to the Mexican border. And that range appears to be expanding. “The northern edge of where these ticks are abundant is moving,” says Dr Richard Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, north of New York City. “It is now well-established further north, into Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and well up into New England.“Climate change is likely playing a role in the northward expansion,” Ostfeld adds, but acknowledges that we don’t know what else could also be contributing.The lone star tick is a sturdy, stealthy predator. It isn’t picky about conditions – it tolerates the damp of Atlantic beaches, and its western expansion only stopped when it ran up against the Texas desert – and is content to feed from dozens of animals, from mice all the way up. It loves birds, which may have helped it move north so rapidly, and it has a special lust for the white-tailed deer that have colonised many American suburbs. And, unlike most ticks, it bites humans in all three stages of its lifecycle: as an adult, as a nymph and as the poppy seed-sized larvae that attacked Platt-Mills, which linger on grass stalks in clusters and spring off hundreds at a time.Ticks detect scent with organs embedded in their first pair of legs, and what they’re sniffing for is carbon dioxide, the exhaled breath of an animal full of warm, oxygenated blood. When lone star ticks catch wind of it, they take off. “The Lyme disease tick is a slow tick,” says Dr William Nicholson, a microbiologist at the CDC. “Amblyomma will run to you.”There has been so little research into alpha-gal allergy that scientists can’t agree on exactly what stage of the bite starts victims’ sensitisation. One aspect of its epidemiology is becoming clear, though: the allergy isn’t only caused by the lone star tick.In Australia, Van Nunen (who is now a clinical associate professor at the University of Sydney School of Medicine) couldn’t understand how her patients’ tick bites solved the mystery of their meat allergy. But she could see something else. The beaches that fringe the coast north and south of Sydney are rife with ticks. If bites from them were putting people at risk of a profound allergy, she felt compelled to get the word out.In 2007, Van Nunen wrote up a description of 25 meat-allergic patients whose reactions she had confirmed with a skin-prick test. All but two had had severe skin reactions to a tick bite more than half had suffered severe anaphylaxis. The crucial detail in Van Nunen’s research was that her cases were caused by bites from Ixodes holocyclus, called the paralysis tick. Alpha-gal allergy was not just an odd occurrence in one part of the US. It had occurred in the opposite hemisphere, making it literally a global problem.And so it has proved. Wherever ticks bite people – everywhere other than the Arctic and Antarctic – alpha-gal allergy has been recorded.It was a sunny early morning at the University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill. Scott Commins, who moved here in 2016 to become an associate professor, had 11 patients to see before the end of the day. Seven of them had alpha-gal allergy.Laura Stirling, 51, was fretting over a list of questions. In 2016, she found a fat lone star tick attached to her, and afterwards had fierce indigestion whenever she ate or smelled pork – a challenge, because her husband likes to tinker with a smoker on weekends. In 2017, she was bitten again, and her symptoms worsened to midnight hives and lightheadedness that sent her to her doctor’s office. She immediately cut all meat and dairy from her diet. A year later, she wanted to know if she could add anything back.“Can I eat dairy?” she asked. “Can I cook dairy? Can I eat it if it doesn’t have animal rennet in it?” She paused. “I’ve been symptom-free, because I don’t take risks.”Commins walked her through a protocol he has developed, a method for adding back mammal products one dose at a time. He has a hypothesis that alpha-gal reactions are linked to the fat content of food that might explain why they take so many hours to occur, because the body processes fat via a slower metabolic pathway than protein or carbs.He recommends that patients start with a spoonful of grated dry cheese, because its fat content is low, and graduate by slow steps up to full-fat yoghurt and milk and then to ice-cream. If those foods don’t provoke reactions, he suggests tiny doses of lean meat, starting with deli ham. Stirling lit up at that. “I dream of charcuterie,” she sighed.Because Commins was part of Platt-Mills’s earliest research, he has been seeing alpha-gal patients for more than a decade now. He estimates he has treated more than 900 men and women five new patients arrive every week. He has coached a significant number of them back to eating some mammal products and managing their exposures to the things they can’t handle, so their worst experience is hunting for an emergency antihistamine tablet, not being rushed to hospital.Commins and Platts-Mills named alpha-gal allergy a decade ago, and Van Nunen saw her first patient 20 years before that. A lab test for the allergy, the one that Tami McGraw received, has been on the market since 2010. (Platts-Mills and Tina Hatley, now Merritt, share the patent.) That makes it hard to understand why patients still struggle to be diagnosed and understand the limits of what they can eat or allow themselves to be exposed to. But alpha-gal allergy defies some of the bedrock tenets of immunology.Food allergies are overwhelmingly caused by proteins, tend to surface in childhood and usually trigger symptoms quickly after a food is consumed. Alpha-gal is a sugar alpha-gal patients tolerate meat for years before their reactions begin and alpha-gal reactions take hours to occur. Plus, the range of reactions is far beyond what’s normal: not only skin reactions in mild cases and anaphylaxis in the most serious, but piercing stomach pain, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea as well.But alpha-gal reactions are definitely an allergy, given patients’ results on the same skin and IgE tests that immunologists use to determine allergies to other foods. That leads both Van Nunen and Commins to wonder whether the syndrome will help to reshape allergy science, broadening the understanding of what constitutes an allergy response and leading to new concepts of how allergies are triggered.Merritt, who estimates she has seen more than 500 patients with alpha-gal allergy, has it herself she has had bad reactions to meat all her life, since being bitten by seed ticks at girl scout camp, and was re-sensitised by a lone star tick bite last year. She is sensitive enough to react not only to meat, but to other products derived from mammal tissues – and as she has discovered, they are threaded throughout modern life.The unrecognised dangers aren’t only sweaters and soaps and face creams. Medical products with an animal origin include the clotting drug heparin, derived from pork intestines and cow lung pancreatic enzymes and thyroid supplements medicines that include magnesium stearate as an inert filler vaccines grown in certain cell lines and other vaccines, and intravenous fluids, that contain gelatine.Some replacement heart valves are grown in pigs they may cause alpha-gal sensitisation that could trigger an allergy attack later. And cardiac patients who have alpha-gal allergy seem to use up replacement heart valves more quickly than normal, putting them at risk of heart failure until they can get a replacement.There’s also a growing sense that alpha-gal may be an occupational hazard. Last year, researchers in Spain treated three farm workers who developed hives and swelling and had difficulty breathing after being splashed with amniotic fluid while they were helping calves to be born. All three of them – a 36-year-old woman, a 56-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man – already knew they had alpha-gal sensitivity, but had never imagined that skin contact would be risky. In the two main Facebook groups where patients gather, it’s common to hear school cafeteria workers fret about reactions from breathing the fumes of meat cooking.What this all means is that there are almost certainly people for whom a meat-containing meal or medical intervention could trigger an alpha-gal reaction of unknown severity.This is an edited version of an article first published by Wellcome on Mosaic and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

Her shambolic negotiations have ended in failure and she no longer has the authority to negotiate for Britain when she doesn’t even have the authority of her own party.”May called off the vote scheduled for Tuesday evening amid near-unanimous predictions she would lose heavily. She then cancelled the regular cabinet meeting and began a rapid tour of EU capitals in an attempt to seek clarifications on the deal, particularly the backstop intended to prevent a hard Irish border.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Corbyn said the “runaway prime minister” was not even seeking to renegotiate the withdrawal deal. “Our prime minister is traipsing around the continent in pursuit of warm words,” he said.He castigated May for sending ministers before the media to insist the vote would happen just hours before it was pulled and for spending £100,000 in a week on Facebook advertising trying to sell her plan to the public. “In the days when she and I served on local councils, council leaders would have been surcharged for wasting public money like that,” Corbyn said.The emergency debate, known as a standing order 24 motion,stated only that the Commons had considered May’s “unprecedented decision not to proceed with the final two days of debate and the meaningful vote”.Labour and other opposition MPs voted against the motion even though Corbyn had proposed it, to signal their displeasure at May’s decision. It was voted down by 299 votes to zero, with the government not asking its MPs to take part. The only Tory who did, Anna Soubry, voted with the opposition.Corbyn argued that, as the government gridlock worsened, the NHS seemed likely to face a winter crisis, homelessness was on the rise and councils and police lacked funding.“This isn’t strong and stable government it’s weak leadership from a weak prime minister,” he said. “If she comes back with nothing more than warm words then she must immediately put her deal before this house. No more delays, no more tricks: let parliament take back control.”Lidington, who is the Cabinet Office minister, said it was absurd to accuse the prime minister of running away whenshe had spent more than 22 hours in the Commons in the past two months debating Brexit and had made six statements. He said there was “no doubt about her commitment to parliamentary accountability, whatever the cost to her in terms of time”.But Justine Greening, the former education secretary and one of relatively few Conservative MPs on the government benches for the debate, intervened to stress to Lidington that May’s endeavours were not the issue. “In the end, what matters to people outside of here isn’t effort, it’s results,” she said. “And this house ought to have the chance to vote on those results.”With barely any Conservatives speaking in support of May, one pointed intervention came from Nadine Dorries, a Tory backbencher and a long-time critic. Dorries said the prime minister had been let down by “third-rate advisers” in Downing Street and compared her plight to the final days of Hitler. “It appears to me that the prime minister is in a bunker. She’s starring in her own Downfall and we all know how that story ends.”Leading Conservative remainer Dominic Grieve said the government had “given itself very considerable latitude as to when this business might return to us”, and called for the rescheduled vote to happen soon. He said: “For this debate to resume on 19 January is simply not acceptable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c29d5675364dd40ad33214f3a32843ca295941/0_324_4862_2917/master/4862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3c35cadced147769393b0779ddd3464","title":"dover checks would take eight hours per lorry in no deal brexit","story":"Haulage bosses say plans for customs ‘dire’ and government in denial over scale of issue Government plans for customs checks at Dover in a no-deal scenario are so impractical it would take eight hours to clear an average lorry carrying food and goods from Calais, the Road Haulage Association has warned.It said plans for no-deal Brexit were “dire” and the sector faced a catastrophe on 30 March.“The government is in denial about the scale of this,” said Rod McKenzie, director of policy at the RHA, which represents major hauliers including Eddie Stobart and DHL.He was speaking after a special summit to discuss Dover and Calais organised in France on Monday by the former French minister and president of the Hauts-de-France region Xavier Bertrand.Hauts-de-France includes Calais, France’s largest passenger port, Boulogne-sur-Mer, its biggest fishing port and Dunkirk, a major cargo port.Bertrand said the French are so concerned about no-deal, they are going ahead with arrangements to keep traffic flowing in Calais.“Our main interest is to protect jobs,” he said. “It is also really crucial we avoid having a commercial war in fisheries.’Bertrand, who has previously made his frustration at the lack of planning for Dover-Calais known, said he decided to take control of the situation this summer to stop an “economic catastrophe” in the absence of high-level political action.“I am convinced that we can avoid this catastrophic scenario. But we don’t have much time left,” he warned.Hauliers were impressed by what they heard in Lille on Monday but said much more needed to be done in Britain. As it stands, each haulier entering Britain will be required to submit a 40-field declaration form per consignment before travel.“That is the worst-case scenario. But even if you took the average trailer which has 400 consignments per delivery, that would take nine people eight hours to process.”“I can’t for the life of me see how this is going to work,” Burnett added, pointing out that 11,000 trucks a day use Dover, triple the amount pre-single market in 1993.Bertrand said his ambition was a “win-win strategy” and a new relationship between the UK and France.“I told Angela Merkel and Emanuel Macron in November that problems in our region are not just problems for us, but for France and Europe as a whole,” said Bertrand.“It is very important to accelerate preparations at a national level. The lorries that will be stopped at the Franco-British border in Calais and elsewhere are not those just for the region but for the whole of Europe and companies that will be blocked from trading will be from the whole of Europe, so delays will affect all countries,” he said.Bertrand said there would be temporary border inspection posts for food controls in place for April and that recruitment had begun for the first batch of 250 customs officials.The region was also working on a “fastpass” virtual queuing system to counter stop-start congestion.He described as “fake news” claims by British politicians that trucks from the EU could simply be waved through customs in an emergency period to maintain a “free flowing” border.“There will be controls for the very simple reason on food, we can’t just have a situation where there are literally no controls.“It is also very important to say that no country in Europe will be more lenient on rules because rules are determined at the EU level. Any country that says that it will have less stringent rules, that cannot be true,” said Bertrand.He called the meeting in Lille out of a sense of urgency. It brought together key officials including representatives of the UK government’s border delivery group and the director of customs in France, who had not met before.Bertrand said the French plans needed to be backed up by an international strategy to communicate with all freight and haulage interests across the EU27.“We need to tell companies locally in France and across Europe about changes that will take place at the border on customs and encourage companies to register the goods that they are trading as early as possible in the process rather than doing everything at the border ... We need to mobilise everybody to avoid that catastrophe,” he said.A spokesman for HMRC said traders would submit customs declarations before transit to avoid delays.He said while no-deal would be a challenge, HMRC had “well developed plans” to ensure “functioning customs, VAT and excise system” in such a scenario.“HMRC will continue to work closely with industry to ensure interventions are carried out in a way that minimise delays and additional burdens for legitimate trade, while robustly ensuring compliance,” said the spokesman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb0347dc36d43466aa8efad4d87e3b288d9062b1/0_0_2326_1395/master/2326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=042f41bff9f658b0317e9e1cd6437a7f","title":"eu steps up plans for no deal brexit as merkel rebuffs may","story":"EU members warned of growing risk as May says UK is also stepping up contingency planning The EU is moving into full no-deal mode, after Theresa May’s shock decision to pull Tuesday’s vote on her Brexit deal prompted Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier to warn privately of a sudden escalation of risk.As she shuttled between EU capitals on a whistlestop diplomatic tour aimed at salvaging her deal, the prime minister also said a hastily-scheduled cabinet meeting on Wednesday would discuss what further steps the government needed to take in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“We have already stepped up the no-deal preparations. That has been happening in recent days. But cabinet will be discussing what is the sensible thing for government to do, which is to make sure that those contingency arrangements for no-deal preparations are in place,” the prime minister said in Brussels.The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, is expected to update the cabinet on no-deal preparations and May said: “We will be looking at what further more we need to do.”Meanwhile, with May declining to set a date at which her deal will be brought back to parliament for ratification, and her official spokesman saying only that it would be before 21 January, France advised its fellow member states that planning for a cliff-edge Brexit now had to be their priority.France’s EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, on a visit to Brussels, suggested her country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, would urge EU leaders at a summit starting on Thursday to take responsibility for their own preparations rather than be sucked into May’s domestic political drama.Loiseau said: “We are very concerned about the delay in the vote on the withdrawal agreement, because this withdrawal agreement is the best deal possible, it is even the only possible agreement. It has been negotiated for months.”Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, is understood to have given a stark analysis of the situation in a meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker and his fellow commissioners, suggesting that the danger of a complete breakdown had significantly increased.The European commission is to publish fresh no-deal warnings next week. During a visit to Berlin, May was reportedly told by Angela Merkel that there could be no renegotiation and that any appeals for help should be made in Brussels rather than brought to the capitals.In a sign of the heightened concerns, Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, took the unusual step of suggesting to his parliament that it was still in Downing Street’s gift to prevent a no-deal by revoking article 50 and turning its back on Brexit.“It remains in the hands of the UK to decide that we don’t end up in a no-deal scenario,” Varadkar said. “The option is there to revoke article 50, the option is there to extend article 50, and where there may not be a majority for anything, or at least any deal at the moment in the House of Commons, I do believe there’s a majority that the UK should not be plunged into a no-deal scenario and it is in their hands at any point in time to take the threat of no-deal off the table either by revoking article 50 or, if that’s a step too far, by extending it.”May will fly to Dublin after Wednesday’s cabinet meeting, in an attempt to win Varadkar’s support for fresh reassurances on the backstop.Brexit-backing cabinet ministers, including Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, are pressing for a legally-binding commitment – perhaps as a formal addendum to the withdrawal agreement.Cabinet sources said the prime minister had warned colleagues on Monday’s cabinet conference call, when she discussed postponing the vote, that reopening the withdrawal agreement would be risky, not least because Varadkar could insist the Northern Ireland-only backstop be restored to the text.Downing Street hailed the removal of the Northern Ireland-only version of the backstop, which May said risked splitting the United Kingdom, as one of its key negotiating successes.As May toured EU capitals, there was fevered speculation back in Westminster that more MPs had written no-confidence letters to the chair of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, to bring them over the threshold of the 48 needed to trigger a leadership ballot.Most of the most prominent May sceptics were wary of making any predictions, bruised by the last time that the letters failed to materialise.One Brexiter MP said he knew colleagues who had spent the day lobbying others to finally send in their letters but many others played down the prospect of the threshold being reached. “A few extras have gone in I think. Who knows how close we are? I can’t understand why there’s not 100 personally,” one said.Another said: “Do I think we’re there tonight? I’m not sure but I think we will be tomorrow.” He added: “Many of us are spending our evenings lobbying other colleagues.”May held talks with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, in The Hague on Tuesday morning before going on to Berlin for talks with Merkel.The German chancellor reported to the parliamentary faction of the CDUCSU alliance of which she is a member that she had excluded the possibility with May of reopening Brexit negotiations. “We said that there will be no further opening of the exit deal,” Merkel said.The prime minister later conducted talks with Juncker, the European commission president, and Donald Tusk, the European council president.Following his meeting with May, Tusk tweeted that the pair had a “long and frank” discussion. “Clear that EU27 wants to help,” he wrote. “The question is how.”Earlier in the day, Juncker had told the European parliament that there was “no room whatsoever for renegotiation”, but that the EU could offer “clarifications and interpretations” to help the prime minister secure MPs’ support.Many Labour MPs including the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, have argued that there is a parliamentary majority to stop a no-deal exit, calling it a “false choice” between May’s deal and no deal. However, Commons officials believe it would be very difficult in practice.MPs opposed to no deal had believed one legal route could be to amend the primarily legislation needed for a semi-orderly no-deal exit, such as an immigration bill, to allow parliament to insist on an extension to article 50.Yet experts have come to believe that those amendments may not be within the scope of the bills and that the amendments could not impose conditions on whether no deal happens or not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb0347dc36d43466aa8efad4d87e3b288d9062b1/0_0_2326_1395/master/2326.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=201b899b2c13a150c718e73b330bb42e 1000w","title":"theresa may struggles with freedom of movement in a child proof limo","story":"In Brussels, the prime minister was rather wishing the car door had never openedWhile the prime minister kept Angela Merkel waiting for 30 seconds as she struggled with the child lock on her limo in Berlin, back home her ministers were left to pick up the pieces of her decision to unilaterally pull the vote on her Brexit deal. Phones that were normally on 247 were switched off.No one wanted to be the fall guy sent out on to the airwaves. It was an occupational hazard to be asked to defend the indefensible. A bit of casual, drive-by fibbing was par for the course. But Theresa May’s latest act of self-harm was above all their pay grades. Now they were being asked to go out with both hands tied behind their backs. The half-life of any government policy was down to a few nanoseconds and now no one had a clue if they were lying or not. Imagine the embarrassment of actually being caught out telling the truth.It was inevitable then that the junior Brexit minister, Robin Walker, was made to answer Yvette Cooper’s urgent question on the legal timing of the vote that had been tabled for the attorney general. There is a good reason Walker is the only minister to have survived in the Brexit department since it was first created. And that’s because he is frightfully polite and breathtakingly dim. Even stupider than Gavin Williamson. He is the government’s very own Private Pike. The over-promoted intern who has outstayed his welcome. A person who can be trusted to know nothing about anything and therefore can never be caught out.Cooper was understandably narked to be palmed off with Walker – she had been expecting the solicitor general (who was also sitting on the government front bench, pretending he didn’t exist) at the very least. But she pressed on regardless, demanding a full legal interpretation of the government’s current position and insisting on a binding commitment that the prime minister wasn’t intending to wind down the clock and defer the vote indefinitely. Walker merely smiled beatifically and nodded. He really didn’t have a clue what she was talking about.Everyone should just relax, Walker said when his synapses finally reconnected. The government’s position was clear as of this moment. Though it could change by the time he sat down. Parliament would get a vote before 21 January. Trust me, I’m a politician. Much to his astonishment, no one from either side of the house felt inclined to do so. Not even the usually ever-present toadies, such as Helen Whately, who can be relied upon to be supportive. The government had blown its last shred of credibility the day before. A tear formed in Walker’s eye. He wasn’t used to such open ridicule.The only upside to Walker’s afternoon was that he wasn’t totally alone. David Lidington also got it in the neck when he was made to answer an emergency debate granted by the Speaker on why the government was basically a bit rubbish and totally untrustworthy. Jeremy Corbyn got things under way with a damning if slightly pedestrian recap of the events of the past few days and weeks. On days like this, he should be eviscerating the government, not trying to bore it into submission.Lidington’s real problem was that he is just a wee bit sharper than Walker. Bright enough to realise just how much trouble he is in. Not least because he has the endearing habit of lowering his eyes and blushing every time he is slightly economical with the actualité. How could anyone doubt the prime minister’s sincerity when she had spent 22 hours at the dispatch box telling MPs something different on every occasion?Over in Brussels, the prime minister was rather wishing the car door had never opened. Her meetings with Mark Rutte, Merkel and Donald Tusk did not go well. None of them had been the slightest bit pleased to see her again so soon. There was to be no renegotiation of the backstop agreement. Just a few more commas and meaningless expressions of intent. It wasn’t enough. “I said I would go back to Brussels and I’ve been back to Brussels,” May gabbled breathlessly. It was the first entirely truthful thing she had said in months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fca5cc8227834bb75116b15b65406af6c3b5d58d/0_56_2167_1300/master/2167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f1a83a6cb2359825409bf07a9077e38","title":"brexit deal latest theresa may eu juncker tells may deal could be clarified but no room whatsoever for renegotiation politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s politics, as Theresa May travels to The Hague, Berlin and Brussels to seek EU support for concessions on the Brexit dealNumerous journalists are now saying they’ve been told that enough Tory MPs have submitted – or are due to submit – letters opposing Theresa May’s leadership to force a confidence vote. They are citing unnamed sources.We have, of course, been here before.A French politician has taken the lead in ensuring there is no “catastrophe” on the Dover-Calais route in the event of no-deal.Xavier Bertrand, a former minister, invited the inter-goverment border delivery group to Lille on Monday. The Road Haulage Association was there and it said the UK government’s plans for customs declarations would mean eight hours of paperwork for a typical lorry.Bertrand told the  he decided to take the lead and has lobbied to get funds from the EU to get Calais ready.Calais is now urgently putting plans in place for temporary border inspection posts and the recruitment of some of the 250 customs officials apparently needed.Boris Johnson has revealed he is dieting and has lost 12 pounds in two weeks after deciding he needed to give up drink and “delicious late-night binges of chorizo and cheese” – just as he could be about to embark on a bid to become prime minister.Writing in the Spectator, the former foreign secretary said he had realised he was “carting around 16-and-a-half stone” after visiting a French doctor and concluded he needed to try to slim down as the UK was leaving the European Union.Modestly comparing his weight to the state of the body politic, Johnson said he hoped to be 15 stone by Christmas, for the first time since he left university, “to toast the moment” when MPs force May to ditch the Northern Ireland backstop.That he said, would amount to “the change that will launch us on a nimbler, lither and more dynamic future,” he wrote, arguing: “If I can do it, so can we all.”Johnson remains one of the favourites to succeed May, should the vulnerable prime minister be dethroned in the aftermath of her decision to pull the vote on her unpopular Brexit deal.His decision to have a haircut at the end of last week prompted speculation that he was readying himself for a run at the leadership, by tidying his normally unruly blond mop in an effort to make himself look more presentable to Tory MPs.Tom Watson, reacting to Boris diet revelation, said: “I applaud Boris Johnson’s diet, I know what it’s like being a middle aged man trying to get fit, but the truth is he won’t lose weight if he keeps trying to have his cake and eat it.”Turning away from the Brexit machinations for a moment: The Labour MP, Kate Osamor, has apologised for her “emotional outbursts” as she deals with a row over her son’s drug conviction and has asked to be afforded the space to care for her family.Osamor resigned as shadow international development secretary on 1 December – the same day the Times reported she had verbally abused one of its journalists. The paper said its reporter was seeking Osamor’s comment for a story on allegations she had misled the public.That’s all from me for today.Theresa May has recorded a clip for broadcasters in Brussels. She has already met the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the European council president, Donald Tusk, and she said there was a “shared determination” in Europe to deliver assurances on the backstop that might satisfy MPs. She said:What has been shown to me from those meetings is there is a shared determination to deal with this issue and address this problem ...The deal we’ve negotiated is a deal that honours the referendum ... It’s the best deal available indeed it’s the only deal available. And the backstop, which is the issue that parliament has raised, is a necessary guarantee for the people of Northern Ireland. And whatever outcome you want, whatever relationship you want with Europe in the future, there is no deal available that does not have a backstop within it. But we don’t want the backstop to be used and, if it is, we want to be certain that it is only temporary. And it’s those assurances that I will be seeking from fellow leaders over the coming days.Asked whether she had been told that the 48 letters to trigger a no-confidence motion in her as Conservative leader had been received, May said: “No, I have been here in Europe dealing with the issue I have promised parliament I would be dealing with.”Carwyn Jones has bowed out as first minister of Wales after nine years leading the country.During his resignation speech in Cardiff, Jones described his feelings as “bittersweet” - he said he was sad to stand down but proud of what he had achieved.Jones received a standing ovation from most fellow assembly members. However, Labour AM Jack Sargeant, the son of Carl Sargeant, who was found hanged four days after he was sacked by Jones as a minister amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour to women, remained in his seat.Before the resignation speech, Sargeant issued a statement in which he said it would be “a real slap in the face” if Jones was given a peerage.Jack Sargeant, who replaced his father as AM for Alyn and Deeside, said: Nothing could be more distressing for the family and friends of Carl to know that such an accolade could be bestowed when there are so many unanswered questions regarding the first minister’s conduct.That apart, the mood in the chamber was respectful and jovial, with political rivals paying tribute to Jones’ command of his wide brief and his steadfastness.Jones’s Labour party colleague, Mark Drakeford, is set to replace him on Wednesday. Jones said: Mark is someone who can effortlessly match both principles and pragmatism, and I have no doubt at all that he will make a superb first minister of Wales.After the ision, the SNP MP Stewart McDonald raised a point of order to complain about the veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner calling him a “piece of shit”. John Bercow, the Speaker, was reluctant to intervene. He said that “moderation and good humour” were conducive to good parliamentary debate, but that he would not comment on something he had not witness and that Skinner was someone he held “in high esteem”.The SO24 motion has been defeated by 299 votes to zero. (See 5.12m.) That amounts to Labour and other opposition parties registering a protest against the government - although, ironically, it involved voting against the motion tabled in Jeremy Corbyn’s name, which in other circumstances would be a Corbyn defeat.The German press has made much out of the incident at the Chancellery in Berlin, when May was unable to get out of the black limousine which drove her up to a red carpet to meet Angela Merkel at lunchtime.“Theresa May began another attempt to save her Brexit deal,” the Bild newspaper wrote. “She met the chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday in order to solicit concessions from her EU colleagues. “But things already began to go wrong when she tried to get out at the chancellery,” the tabloid wrote. “The door of May’s car was still locked. An embarrassing moment: the prime minister had exit problems and couldn’t get out”.The two leaders chuckled over the incident as they shook hands for waiting cameras.At the meeting May, who was accompanied by advisers and the British ambassador, was told by Merkel that no reopening of the negotiations was possible.Later, May met Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel’s successor as leader of the Christian Democratic Union from which she stepped down on Friday.Kramp-Karrenbauer and May held what was described as a 20-minute get-to-know-you meeting at the British embassy in the centre of the German capital, where according to a CDU spokeswoman they talked about the Brexit negotiations as well as future cooperation between the CDU and the British Conservative party.MPs are now voting on the S024 motion on the government’s management of the meaningful vote debate. Normally these debates don’t end in a ision. But Labour is keen to make a point - the wording of the motion is mildly critical of the government (see 1.51pm) - and it has forced a vote. The government is abstaining, and Labour has has to put up tellers on both sides to ensure the ision actually goes ahead.My colleague Marina Hyde has a new column on Brexit. It is hard to do justice to the some of the political delinquency that has been on display, but, as usual, Marina is up to the task. Here is an extract.And yet, there are hourly reminders that it could be a lot worse. European Research Group henchman Steve Baker MP has declared that the four Eurosceptics who have quit the cabinet – Boris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey – should decide which one of them will run as a Brexit PM. What a banquet of choice for the British people that would be. According to YouGov polling this week, Boris Johnson’s approval ratings are currently minus 35, David Davis’s are minus 19, Dominic Raab’s are minus 21, and Esther McVey’s were not polled, presumably on the basis that the recently departed high priestess of universal credit would break their measuring device.Incredibly, though, Boris still spent the weekend casting himself as Aslan in some abortion of a Narnia metaphor, when he’s absolutely the biggest Edmund ever to stalk the earth. “Betray my family for a bit of high-end Turkish delight? Yes please!”And here is the full article.After her meeting with Theresa May, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told the CDUCSU alliance of which she is a member that she had excluded the possibility of reopening Brexit negotiations. “We said that there will be no further opening of the exit deal,” Merkel said in Berlin on this afternoon.But Merkel reportedly added that she remained confident that a solution to the impasse could be found, according to the German news agency DPA, pointing out that the majority of British MPs were not in favour of leaving the EU without a deal.Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn’s, and one of the senior Labour figures most sceptical about a second referendum, has said that Corbyn should not be bounced into holding an early no confidence vote in the government.Ian Lavery, the Labour chair, has posted this on Twitter saying much the same.Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister, does not seem to have got the message. She told LBC there would be a vote before Christmas. But this has been dismissed by party sources, and so it was either an honest mistake by Chapman, wishful thinking, or an attempt to push the policy in this direction.Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative Brexiter and former party leader, has told ITV that he detects “a mood shift” in the party and that he knows of MPs who have decided within the last 24 hours to submit letters calling for a no confidence vote in Theresa May as party leader.And this is from ITV’s Paul Brand.Here is the Reuters story about Angela Merkel’s talks with Theresa May. And here is an extract.German leader Angela Merkel ruled out further negotiations on Brexit on Tuesday but said efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances after Prime Minister Theresa May abruptly pulled a parliamentary vote at home because she faced defeat ...According to two sources, Merkel told her conservative parliamentary group on Tuesday that there would be no further negotiations on Brexit though she also said efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances.According to the sources, Merkel said May had admitted to her that she would not have got a majority in the Commons and it was not in anyone’s interests for Britain to leave the EU without a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c5336b86624d4a0d05337163a9b6ae04c9646f2/0_168_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2340a1621b64129e391f89ee4aa851d","title":"forgotten statue kept in a margarine tub is 2000 year old treasure","story":"Silver-eyed Minerva found by a farmer 10 years ago dates back to first or second centuryA 2,000-year-old Roman statuette of a silver-eyed goddess Minerva that for more than a decade was kept in a plastic margarine tub is among a record number of treasure discoveries made by the nation’s army of metal detectorists.The British Museum on Tuesday revealed the details of 1,267 finds across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, more than there has ever been since the Treasure Act was passed in 1996.They include everything from prehistoric metalwork to a 17th-century pocket watch – but the goddess with the silver eyes was particularly striking. It was discovered by a detectorist in a field near the village of Hailey, Oxfordshire, more than a decade ago but it was assumed to be a modern copy, nothing more than a curiosity.The landowner placed the Minerva statuette in a large, empty Flora tub and more or less forgot about it.This year Len Jackman, a retired lorry driver, asked the farmer if he could search for treasures on his land and was told about the statue in the tub.“I thought it looked important and old,” Jackman said, but it was not until a few months later, when he had found a number of items nearby, that they agreed he should take it to the local finds liaison officer. “I said ‘I think you’ll be getting a phone call’.”Anni Byard, the finds liaison officer for Oxfordshire, recalled: “The objects had been left for me on my desk and I picked up the tub and assumed it might be a piece of lead it was so heavy. I unwrapped the tissue paper and it was just ‘wow’… a fantastic moment.“I knew straight away that it was Roman and it is not something you normally see.“It’s the first statue of this size I’ve seen in 10 years of doing my job.”The copper-alloy and lead statuette of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, dates from the first or second century and would most likely have been on a shrine. Her head has been detached from the body but to even find her head was remarkable, said archaeologists.“It is such an amazing object and it could make an amazing object for a museum collection if that’s what happens to it,” said Michael Lewis, the head of portable antiquities and treasure at the British Museum.Other items unveiled by the museum included a shimmering gold bulla, or pendant, which could easily pass as a piece of art-deco jewellery from the 1930s. It was found in the Shropshire Marches and in fact dates from about 3,500 years ago.“It really is one of the most exquisite pieces of bronze age gold that I’ve seen,” said the curator Neil Wilkin.It was only the second bronze age gold bulla ever found in England. The other one, found in the 18th century during canal digging in Manchester, was lost so “we hope that it might come out of the woodwork now,” said Wilkin. “If it looked like this someone could easily have thought it was a modern object because it is so beautiful, so pretty.”Lewis said the rising figures were down to greater engagement between archaeologists and hobby detectorists, two communities which have not always got on.In the 1970s and 80s there was a campaign by some archaeologists to stop metal detecting. Lewis said: “There was a misunderstanding on both sides about what the other was up to.“There was an idea that metal detecting was all about finding things for financial gain and ruining archaeology.“Over the years it has been realised that there are a lot of people interested in the past, quite happy for the objects to go in to museums. We’re still on a journey, don’t get me wrong … it is very important that the right people are doing metal detecting.”The finds by metal detectorists were welcomed by the heritage minister, Michael Ellis, who has announced a consultation on how the system could be improved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1836b1a48bcb472fb6aabbc0ea0e2cb1fc5558c8/47_0_2325_1395/master/2325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc905cb11f0326c184fa3a2d4710a3f","title":"creative alphazero leads way chess computers science","story":"Garry Kasparov is not only humanity’s greatest ever chess player but its highest-profile victim of artificial intelligence. His loss to IBM’s super computer Deep Blue in 1997 made global headlines and left him feeling bitter and, well, blue. Yet there is a warm glint in his eye when he talks about AlphaZero, the game-changing chess programme that took just four hours to teach itself to become the strongest in history.“For me, as a very sharp and attacking player, it is a pleasure watching AlphaZero play,” he said after playing in a charity tournament for Chess in Schools before the London Chess Classic, which runs until Monday. “We all expect machines to play very solid and slow games but AlphaZero just does the opposite. It is surprising to see a machine playing so aggressively, and it also shows a lot of creativity. It is a real breakthrough – and I believe it could be extremely helpful for many other studies in the field of computer science.”Aggressive. Creative. Helpful. These are words you might not normally associate with artificial intelligence. Indeed, they sound rather human. But for AlphaZero’s creator, Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Deep Mind, this is just the start of what it might be able to do. As he points out, the next step is to use its capabilities to solve real-world problems – such as protein folding, which is responsible for diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cystic fibrosis. But he also expects AlphaZero to be able to develop stronger and lighter materials, better medicines and eventually become flexible enough to adapt to new situations.“Deep Blue could play chess well,” explains Hassabis. “But that is all it could do. It couldn’t play noughts and crosses or Connect 4, or any such simple games. In other words, it couldn’t demonstrate two components which are core to what defines human intelligence – our flexible intelligence and our learning capacity.”AlphaZero is different. In a long-awaited paper published in the journal Science last week, the authors explain how it learned to conquer Chess, Go and Shogi by playing millions of games against itself via a process of trial and error called reinforcement learning. In more than 1,000 games against Stockfish, a regular winner of the computer chess world championship, it won 155 games with only six defeats, with the rest drawn.Hassabis was a child chess prodigy, who learned the game aged four and was able to beat his dad three weeks later – indeed, when he started playing competitively he was so small he had to bring a pillow with him to reach the board – and became a strong player. Yet in AlphaZero’s case there was no human input, other than telling it the rules of each game. “In a matter of a few hours it was superhuman,” Hassabis says proudly.The next logical step, he agrees, would be for AlphaZero to attempt to master games with hidden information, such as poker or the computer game Starcraft 2. “Those are big challenges but we’ll have something interesting to say about those in the next 12 months,” he says. “It would very interesting if it could play nine-player Texas No Limit poker, with all the bluffing involved. No computer is yet able to do that but we think AlphaZero could, if we decided to do it.”Before setting up DeepMind in 2010, Hassabis worked in computer games, including being the lead AI programmer on the iconic god game Black \u0026amp White. So does he ever worry that the machines could become our gods? “Powerful technologies, and AI is no different, are neutral in themselves,” he says. “So it depends on society and humanity. How we decide to share the gains is also going to determine whether it is good or bad for the world.”That doesn’t sound entirely like a flat “no”. But Hassabis is a big believer in human ingenuity. “I think that given enough time and enough human brainpower we will address these questions,” he says. “We are at quite a nascent stage when it comes to understanding how AlphaZero is making decisions. Us and many other teams are now reverse-engineering these systems, and building visualisation and other analysis tools. In five years’ time we will have tools that allow us to look inside this black box and really understand what it does.”Kasparov, who last year published Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins, a well received book on his match against Deep Blue and the future of AI, agrees that we should be optimistic.“I don’t see a shred of intelligence that AI will take over despite this anxiety and fear among the public,” he says. “This is a Hollywood dystopian view. In reality I believe AI will help tremendously and it is much more likely that we and computers will collaborate together for the benefit of humanity.”Hassabis says that he would actually be more worried about the state of the world without the prospect of better AI in the future. “Look at the problems the world faces. We need cures for tragic diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s, which are also costly to treat. I think AI could help with those kinds of things as well as helping find new drugs, new materials and to better analyse climate change.”So how would he assuage the fears of doubters? “Ask yourself, if we didn’t have something like AI coming down the line how would we solve these problems?” he says. “Either we are going to need an exponential improvement in human behaviour, so we become more collaborative and less selfish and short term, or we have got to have an exponential improvement in technology to solve the big problems we are creating for ourselves. I don’t see much evidence for the former.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/313903369d00ceb28d67373e6aad46b463df7fe2/0_0_4212_2526/master/4212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e630e5b24f9f2fb0a5d1563b7454ed15","title":"olympian jess varnish accuses british cycling of extreme control employment tribunal","story":"Employment tribunal hears athlete allege she was punished for minor transgressionsThe Olympic cyclist Jess Varnish has accused British Cycling of exercising “extreme control” over her and other athletes in her long-running legal attempt to sue the organisation for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal.In order to bring her discrimination claim, Varnish, 28, must first prove that she was an employee of either British Cycling, which didn’t pay her but had supported her training since she was 12, or UK Sport, which from 2015 provided her with a £21,500 tax-free grant towards her living and training costs.She fell out publicly with British Cycling in the run-up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, when she was kicked off the podium programme for top athletes. She had failed to qualify for her sprint event at the Olympics and her coaches decided she was unlikely to win a medal at Rio.Varnish then gave a media interview claiming one of her coaches, Shane Sutton, had told her she was “too old” and should leave and “have a baby”. Sutton subsequently said: “I’m adamant that I am innocent. I have definitely never overstepped the mark.” He did however accept he had told her to lose some “timber”.It says that the “athlete performance award” received by Varnish was “akin to grants offered in the past by local authorities to help students pay for their living costs while studying for degrees”.In documents submitted to an employment tribunal in Manchester on Tuesday, Varnish argued that she was an employee because of the “net of control” extended over her and other athletes by British Cycling, alleging it punished them for minor transgressions, and told them what to wear, eat and say in public.She had to wear Team GB kit even when arriving at the velodrome for training, leaving “very limited opportunity for self expression”, she claimed, and had to relinquish her own image rights to British Cycling. She said she was “obliged” to complete media appearances and volunteer days for both British Cycling and UK Sport, where athletes “were told what to say or what to avoid”.She described being punished after turning up 10 minutes late to her first training session with her “idols” Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, when she was still a teenager. Her coach, Iain Dyer, made her “ride around the velodrome for 30 laps as punishment for being late. He made me stick out like a sore thumb when everyone else was just warming up.” She complained: “Non-compliance with the rules was just not tolerated for any reason whatsoever.”Varnish said British Cycling even owned her blood samples – “this is an example of the extreme control exercised over the lives of cyclists.” She also had to submit to monthly skin fold tests to check how much fat she had put on, and had to take pictures of her food via an app to send to her coaches. She also described cyclists regularly training until they vomited and being forced to train when her hands were bleeding and blistered after lifting 180kg weights.She said she was “completely” supported by British Cycling and UK Sport: “I received top quality medical care, dentistry, psychological support … I think UK Sport estimate that this is worth about £23,000 to £40,000.”Varnish joined British Cycling’s talent programme aged 12 and moved up the ranks until 2010, when she joined the podium programme, reserved for elite cyclists with a chance of winning a medal at either a world championship or Olympics. When she first moved to Manchester to train as a teenager she was given £7,500 a year from UK Sport. She lived in a flat rented by British Cycling and paid £250 in rent.She told the tribunal that she missed out on lucrative sponsorship agreements with Virgin Trains and the clothing company Sweaty Betty because they were vetoed by British Cycling.But under cross-examination by Thomas Linden, QC, representing British Cycling, Varnish accepted she had set up a business in 2010 “for tax purposes” through which her sponsorship deals could be processed.The tribunal heard that in June 2011 she signed a three-year deal with Boots that promised to pay her £32,500 in the first 18 months and then a further £50,000. To earn the money she had to commit to nine eight-hour days promoting Boots each year, Linden told the tribunal. If she won medals in 2012-2014 she would receive bonuses of £5,000 a time, he added.Varnish, asked why she hadn’t declared either the business or a sponsorship deal with Boots in her witness statement, said: “I wrote the witness statement about the level of control. Because that’s what it was about.”Linden put it to her that she was able to enter into the Boots deal because she knew Dyer would not object. “I could sign it whether it would be disapproved of or not,” she accepted. Linden said Dyer, who was due to give evidence to the tribunal, had been “very sympathetic to requests from athletes for sponsorship opportunities because he understood the need for athletes to earn from other sources.”She also had a deal to get a free car from Nissan, a British Olympic Federation partner, and had a commercial agreement with Adidas, the tribunal heard.Evidence was also expected to be heard from witnesses including Varnish’s partner, the former BMX world champion Liam Phillips, and Dr Richard Freeman, the former British Cycling team doctor who was embroiled in the Bradley Wiggin’s jiffy bag scandal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a389e4a1674863bcdc127f7dfbc1a192b65769e5/3_70_3685_2211/master/3685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e278658070ae4acce56a13e5b04a61dd","title":"premiership rugby hopes to finalise cvc deal by christmas","story":"Premiership Rugby hopes to conclude a £230m agreement with a private equity firm before Christmas after a board meeting on Tuesday failed to tie up a few loose ends.“There remains unanimity about our approach and our desire to enter into a requirement for a significant investment which we think will herald a new era for the league,” said the Premiership Rugby chairman, Ian Ritchie. “We remain on track in achieving our objectives but nothing has yet been concluded.“These discussions are inevitably complex and take whatever time is necessary. We had a good meeting and have a shared objective. We are still in discussions and they will continue.

They were reassured the lump sum they receive will be a windfall with proceeds from sponsorship and broadcasting deals expected to rise significantly if CVC gets involved.CVC, which used to own Formula One, would have no say in the running of the league but would lead its commercial arm. “We are not there yet because discussions like this one are not straightforward,” said the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Mark McCafferty. “It is a question of time rather than principle and we would like to resolve this before Christmas.“It always comes down to a few issues and we will work through them.

Pichai characterized the Chinese search product as an “internal effort” and said the company would be “transparent” and consult with policy makers before launching in China.Pressed to rule out launching a tool that would enable censorship and surveillance in China, however, Pichai appeared to offer the company’s probable justification for reentering a market that it left in 2010: “We think it’s in our duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information.”“We have explored what search could look like if it were launched in a country like China,” the executive eventually conceded, though he dodged questions about specifics. He also revealed that “at one point” the company had more than 100 people working on the project.Pichai also faced questions on data and privacy issues, as well as allegations of partisan political bias – a subject of outsized fixation for Republican lawmakers.Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the committee, set the tone for much of the questioning in his opening statement, when he discussed the troubling nature of “allegations Google manipulates its algorithms to favor the political party its likes, the ideas it likes or the products it likes” – allegations that he offered no evidence for.“I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way,” Pichai said in opening remarks. “To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests. We are a company that provides platforms for erse perspectives and opinions – and we have no shortage of them among our own employees.”Pichai also emphasized the American-ness of the global company. “It’s no coincidence that a company dedicated to the free flow of information was founded right here in the US,” he said. “As an American company, we cherish the values and freedoms that have allowed us to grow and serve so many users.”More enlightening lines of questioning addressed Google’s privacy practices and prodigious data collection.“Google is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blush,” Goodlatte said.Pichai’s responses to questions about Google’s data collection focused on the ability of users to control their privacy concerns, and generally emphasized that Google collects information in order to provide services that users want. That tradeoff was illustrated when Goodlatte both raised concerns about Google collecting information about users’ location – and admitted that he uses a fitness tracker to count the number of steps he takes each day.The executive’s testimony comes at a time of increasing scrutiny for Google. The company will emerge from 2018 significantly less damaged than Facebook, which has borne the brunt of public outrage over fake news and foreign interference in elections.But a growing labor movement within the company is putting pressure on Google over sensitive issues such as the Chinese censorship project, sexual harassment and performing work for the defense department.The company continues to draw the ire of antitrust and privacy campaigners, who hope that the incoming Democratic majority in the House could lead to regulation of the giant internet platforms.But the partisan political attacks on Google appeared to work in the company’s favor by dragooning Democratic representatives into defending the company. Some Democratic lawmakers were more forceful in their assertions of Google’s right to a political viewpoint than Pichai was.The hearing was Pichai’s first outing on Capitol Hill. The Indian-born executive took the helm of Google in 2015, when the company restructured and the then CEO, Larry Page, relinquished the role to be chief executive of Alphabet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aa33d84b9b0c170a07eb570cee0be5a6fc71a42/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18a1d8f481fa465fb11200c4971892ab","title":"share your best travel discovery of 2018 for the chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Did you find somewhere really fabulous on your travels this year?

But to say that a child must do less homework in order to have more free time seems extravagant to me.”Giovanni Lo Storto, the director general of Rome’s LUISS University, said the level of homework given to children varied from school to school.“Bussetti makes an interesting point, but it also shines a light on equilibrium,” Lo Storto told the . “If children have to do too much work at home, it might mean they are doing less work at school.”Bussetti’s comments are in line with the Italian government’s focus on preserving traditional family values.In September, Luigi Di Maio, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Five Star Movement, the League’s coalition partner, said measures would be introduced to limit Sunday trading because liberal opening hours had “destroyed Italian families”.The government has also included a proposal in its draft budget for 2019 to reward parents who have a third child with free farmland, in an attempt to increase Italy’s low birthrate.Last month, Bussetti said he backed a suggestion for crucifixes to be hung up in all schools and for nativity scenes to be installed in the run-up to Christmas, arguing that both symbols were part of Italian “identity”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/764d59ea896017710fda4433d8a429e61911123a/0_150_4512_2707/master/4512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ae5be2e666d0a497540c933e25b6eb5","title":"macron president of the rich speech elysee palace gilets jaunes","story":"Flaunting Élysée Palace’s gilded rooms does little to quell ‘president of the rich’ tagIt was the most important TV appearance of Emmanuel Macron’s presidency: the 40-year-old former banker had to prove to an angry nation that he was not an arrogant “president of the rich” and that he understood ordinary French people’s struggle to make ends meet.Yet Macron’s choice to deliver his prerecorded speech on social inequality from one of the most opulent and golden rooms in the luxurious, 365-room Élysée Palace was not lost on gilets jaunes protesters who have been occupying protest barricades on rural roundabouts.Indeed, the Élysée Palace, the French presidential residence and workplace that is twice the size of the US White House and costs €104m a year to run, has been the object of fury during the protests. The demonstrations, which began as a citizens’ revolt against a proposed fuel tax on 17 November have quickly morphed into wider anti-government demonstrations against inequality.On the barricades, many have been critical of the Macrons for redecorating some rooms in the palace – including the main reception room where new carpets will cost €300,000 (£271,000). Macron chose to announce his measures aimed at calming the gilets jaunes protests by speaking from the traditional presidential office known as the salon doré, with its gold decorations.He sat behind the large antique desk that has been used by all presidents since Charles de Gaulle and is the most valuable piece of furniture in the gilded palace. At the edge of the frame was a golden cockerel, the symbol of France, between golden lamps, and three carefully placed antique books. Behind him, just to the right of a pair of ornate gold leaf doors, were the French and European flags.The 13-minute address had to prove the pro-business Macron understood the “real world” of protesters. There had been outrage among gilets jaunes when an MP from Macron’s party, La République En Marche, was recently unable to state the minimum wage on TV or when a cabinet minister trying to show the gulf between the working poor and the political elite appeared to complain that Paris dinners cost “€200 without wine”.Macron’s every twitch and movement was scrutinised by viewers. Some wondered if he had a rash on his neck, perhaps from stress. Others felt the way he sat with hands on the table looked a bit like a school teacher returning homework. But a record 23 million people tuned in – about the same number as for the French football team’s winning World Cup final.Macron usually prefers to make TV addresses from his everyday office next door, which features vast works of modern art, including a copy of American street artist Shepard Fairey’s portrait of the Marianne symbol of the French republic. But Macron has said he likes to work in the golden presidential office when he has to focus on things that are more “complex” and require “time and order”. It is also where he meets global leaders such as Donald Trump.“He doesn’t live in the real world” is a common refrain on the barricades, where Macron is likened to a monarch. It remains to be seen whether an appearance from a gilded room in an 18th-century palace will change people’s minds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f41ae9f9a2ac6872f860939dbd89994365eac63/833_0_1546_928/master/1546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fcd83bab2d932b558785b866ac4c286","title":"michael kovrig detained china former canadian diplomat","story":"Michael Kovrig’s employer, the International Crisis Group, is seeking his release but it is unclear if the case is related to Meng WanzhouA former Canadian diplomat has been detained in China, and his current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was seeking his prompt and safe release.Michael Kovrig’s detention comes after police in Canada arrested Huawie’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on 1 December at the request of USauthorities, a move that infuriated Beijing.It was not immediately clear if the cases were related, but the arrest of Huawei’s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver has stoked fears of reprisals against the foreign business community in China.Saying he was “deeply concerned,” the public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, confirmed that a Canadian citizen had been detained in China, but he provided no details on who it was.Goodale said there was “no explicit indication at this moment” that the Canadian’s detention was linked to Meng’s arrest.Meng was due in court on Tuesday on the third day of a bail hearing in Vancouver“International Crisis Group is aware of reports that its north-east Asia senior adviser, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China,” the thinktank said in a statement.“We are doing everything possible to secure additional information on Michael’s whereabouts as well as his prompt and safe release,” it added.China’s foreign ministry and ministry of public security did not respond immediately to questions faxed earlier about Kovrig’s detention.The exact reason for the detention was not immediately clear.The Canadian embassy declined to comment, referring queries to Ottawa.Calls to Kovrig’s phones were not answered.Kovrig, a Mandarin speaker, has been working as a full-time expert for the International Crisis Group since February 2017.From 2003 to 2016, he worked as a diplomat with stints in Beijing and Hong Kong, among others, according to his profile on LinkedIn."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Maxim ZmeyevAFP Getty Dmitry Kuznetsov, better-known by his stage name Husky, was a minor star on Russia’s flourishing hip hop scene until police arrested him last month for staging an impromptu concert from the roof of a parked car. A brief brush with the law has boosted the 25-year-old rapper’s profile and turned his I’ll Sing My Music single into a national battle cry against arts censorship.Husky is by no means the only artist feeling the heat as Russia cracks down on alternative music. But the public outcry about his case has highlighted the risks the Kremlin faces as it moves to exert control over Russian youth’s favourite form of musical entertainment.Rap arrived in Russia from the West in the 1990s and exploded in popularity as the internet came of age, freeing performers from the confines of state controlled television. Top rappers can fill whole stadiums with fans at public concerts, but their main outlets are on social networking sites where they count their success not in thousands but millions of viewer clicks. Hip hop has overtaken pop and rock to become the main music in Russia, says Miron Fyodorov, otherwise known as Oxxxymiron, one of Russia’s most famous rap artists. “It’s like a revolution going on and it’s going to grow further.”Troubles began for rappers last month after a deputy in the Leningrad region parliament asked Russia’s prosecutor to ban alternative music concerts, saying they promoted all kinds of disruptive social behaviour from Satanism to suicide, extremism and betrayal of the motherland.Russian rap, laced with expletives and references to drugs and alcohol, certainly doesn’t jive with Vladimir Putin’s policy to restore traditional values. But political imperatives are also driving the Kremlin to act.Rap’s growing popularity had “inevitably” made it a battleground for the hearts and minds of youth, Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst told Echo Moskvy radio. Russia’s protest movement – led by Putin’s arch foe Alexei Navalny – was “fashionable” among the young so rappers would feel compelled to tilt towards the opposition whatever their political views, he added.Russian showbusiness stars have spoken up for rappers, warning the Kremlin not to repeat the communist party’s ill-judged decision to ban rock bands that helped radicalise Soviet youth in the 1980s. The US state department might well be funding the hip hop crackdown to undermine the Kremlin, joked Alexander Makarevich, a veteran Russian rock artist.“The best way to fall out with the young is to think up something to make impossible for them,” he said.Husky leapt on to the roof of a car to perform in the southern city of Krasnodar on November 21st after a local club, citing concern about Russian anti-extremist laws, abruptly cancelled a gig he had planned. The following day he was sentenced to 12 days in police detention on twin charges of petty hooliganism and refusing to take a drink and drugs test.Rappers are not a united group, but Oxxxymiron immediately rallied fellow stars Basta and Noize MC, to stage a joint concert in Moscow to demonstrate solidarity with Husky and protest against government censorship of the arts.”It’s not just about Husky, but about us and the future of music in Russia,” Oxxxymiron told fans.In a surprise development Husky was released a few hours before the event began having served less than half of his sentence. Navalny, who attended the Moscow concert with his family, said the authorities had let the rapper out “not just because they are scared but because they know they are in the wrong”.That may be but law enforcers have continued to make problems for rappers. Husky called off planned gigs in six cities last month saying he had faced “billions of difficulties and pressure from you-know-who”. IC3PEAK, a rap duo made up of Nasty Kreslina and Nikolai Kostylev said they had been tailed by Russian special services in the city of Perm where their planned concert was cancelled and briefly detained by police when they arrived in Novosibirsk for another event.Police were taking a selective approach and targeting junior league rappers rather than risking confrontation with big stars, said Elena Saveleva, a spokeswoman for Noize.“I don’t like what’s going on. Music and politics should not be mixed,” she told The .Signs that Kremlin spin doctors were scrambling to paper over the rift with the rap community came on Sunday when Dmitry Kiselyev, the host of Rossiya TV’s popular weekly news show, dedicated a full 20 minutes to discussing the hip hop craze and its links – not to Afro-American street culture – but to Russia’s legendary poetic traditions. “Rappers’ verbal associations are not the language of polite society,” he said, “but it’s not worth creating nightmares for them. They’re simply people.”Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the Russian domestic secret services, said the government should consider awarding rap artists grants, to support “contemporary forms of poetic and musical creativity”.Ms Saveleva said she hoped rappers would not accept financial support from the state. “Serebrennikov took a grant and look what happened to him,” she said, referring to the progressive Russian theatre director Kirill Serebrennikov, who is undergoing trial on charges of embezzling state art funds that are widely believed to be politically motivated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3727896.1544548843!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may to visit dublin as part of effort to save brexit deal","story":"The European Union is willing to give Britain further clarifications on its Brexit deal but will not renegotiate the treaty or its protocol on the Irish border, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday (December 11).\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May (L) shakes hands with Angela Merkel ahead of talks at the Chancellery in Berlin on Tuesday. Photographer: Krisztian BocsiBloombergBritish prime minister Theresa May will travel to Dublin on Wednesday as her efforts to save her floundering Brexit deal continue.Having postponed a House of Commons vote on the withdrawl agreement, with defeat appearing certain, Mrs May began a tour of European captials on Tuesday which appears unlikley to yield the concessions shes is seeking on the Northern Ireland backstop.The backstop, an insurance policy included in the agreement to ensure that there is no hard border in Ireland in the event of the UK departing the EU without a deal, is the main sticking point for MPs at Westminster.The EU has been clear that it will give “clarifications” on aspects of the withdrawal agreement but will not countenance reopening the deal.“The deal we achieved is the best possible. It’s the only deal possible. There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation,” European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said in an address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg.The British parliament will vote on a deal before January 21st, Mrs May’s spokeswoman said. If there is no satisfactory deal by then, parliament will still be given a debate on the issue.Mrs May called on Tuesday called on German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte in the Hague in an attempt to win some concessions. She was also due to meet Mr Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk later to seek assurances and ways to give British politicians powers over the Irish backstop.She is to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin late on Wednesday ahead of an EU summit on Thursday and Friday at which the Brexit withdrawal agreement is likely to dominate the agenda.“An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar will hold a meeting with the British Prime Minister, Theresa May Wednesday evening in Government Buildings in advance of the European Council meeting,” a statement from Government Buildings said.With less than four months until the UK is due to leave the EU on March 29th, Mrs May has warned British MPs that if they reject her deal then the only other options were a disorderly no-deal orce, or a reversal of Brexit that would defy the will of those who voted for it.Mrs May’s critics say the backstop, which keeps the UK in the EU customs union in the absence of a better way to avoid border checks, could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely.Mr Juncker said neither side intended for the backstop ever to take effect, but it had to be part of the deal to protect the Belfast Agreement.“We have a common determination to do everything to be not in a situation one day to use that backstop, but we have to prepare,” he said. “It’s necessary for the entire coherence of what we have agreed. It’s necessary for Britain and it’s necessary for Ireland. Ireland will never be left alone.”Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney addressed the Cabinet on Tuesday on contingency plans being worked on in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Coveney said that while the UK leaving without a deal was unlikely, the Government has to be prepared. Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, he said the EU had made it very clear the backstop is not going to change.Mr Coveney said the DUP had changed the backstop “into something that it isn’t, they’ve created fear. There is no threat to the sovereignty of Northern Ireland”.He said Mrs May understands the fragility of the peace process and that backstop is not something to be feared. There was no ulterior motive and it is consistent with the promises to the people “of this island”, he added.British Conservatives opposed to the withdrawal agreement continue to raise concerns over Mrs May’s leadership on Tuesday.“If we can’t go forwards with her deal . . . then I’m afraid the only way to change the policy is to change the prime minister and I really think it’s her duty to go,” Brexit-supporting MP Steve Baker said.A leadership challenge is triggered if 48 Conservatives write letters demanding one to the chairman of the party’s so-called 1922 committee, Graham Brady.Mrs May’s decsion to pull the parliamentary vote on the deal the day before it was due to take place promped ridicule, calls for an election and blunt warnings that her effort to win changes to the deal would be in vain.She said the deeper question was whether lawmakers wanted to deliver on the people’s will expressed in a 2016 referendum, or open up isions with another national vote.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier HosletEPATheresa May’s government has promised MPs that the vote on her Brexit deal, which was postponed this week, will take place before January 21st next year. But as the prime minister toured European capitals to seek concessions on the Northern Ireland backstop, speculation was rife at Westminster about an imminent challenge to her leadership.Conservative Brexiteers who failed to win enough support to challenge Mrs May last month were confident on Tuesday that they were close to winning the backing of enough MPs to trigger a confidence vote. If Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, receives 48 letters calling for such a vote, a ballot could be held within days.Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, a Brexiteer who has until now opposed a challenge to Mrs May, said there was a “mood shift” against her.“I detect in the last 24 hours people have decided this isn’t going to work out . . . and people who wouldn’t have put letters in are openly saying ‘my letter is going in’,” he told ITV News.Veteran Eurosceptic Bill Cash said Mrs May’s decision to postpone the vote on her Brexit deal rather than face a crushing defeat had doomed her premiership.“The prime minister has now reached the cliff-edge of resignation. I believe that she may well have to resign. Yesterday’s events – running away from the vote and then off to Germany, Holland and the EU – was yet another humiliation for the United Kingdom. She is clinging to the wreckage. She has reached the point of no return,” he said.Sir Bill was speaking during an emergency debate on the prime minister’s decision to postpone the vote, which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said demeaned her office. He said Mrs May no longer had the authority to negotiate for her country if she had lost authority in her own party.But Mr Corbyn resisted calls from other opposition parties to table a motion of no confidence in the government, saying he would do so at “the appropriate time”. The Labour Party leader’s critics accuse him of dragging his feet because his party’s policy demands that, if an attempt to trigger a general election fails, Labour should pursue other options for Brexit, including a second referendum.Former Conservative cabinet minister Nicky Morgan suggested that a government of national unity might be needed to prevent a no-deal Brexit.“I do not know how we test parliamentary opinion if we do not have a vote. Perhaps we need to set up a special select committee of senior members of parliament to hammer out what we mean. Perhaps it is time for some sort of government of national unity,” she said.“Perhaps it is time for a free vote on the deal, avoiding the usual party political constraints. However, I do know that with 108 days to go until this country leaves the EU, if the government cannot sort out this matter of great national importance, parliament must step in, stop posturing and get down to work to hammer out a deal.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May in the House of Commons on Monday following a statement where she told MPs that tomorrow’s ‘meaningful vote’ on her Brexit deal had been deferred. Photograph: ParbulPA WireWe are in the market for a “reassurance”. A clarification, not a renegotiated treaty. A way of demonstrating that the withdrawal treaty, and specifically its backstop provision, are not a straightjacket that will confine the UK against its will in the EU customs union for ever more.What then can be done for the UK given the constraints of the treaty? A declaration that the UK can unilaterally repudiate the backstop would undermine the safeguard completely and would be a clear breach of the treaty. Not on. But a clear explanation of the role and mandate of the little-understood arbitrators, whose binding role is provided for in the treaty to adjudicate a deadlock between the EU and UK over leaving the backstop, is another matter. EU leaders anxious to help British prime minister Theresa May out of her pickle are keen to offer some comfort. They were not helped, however, by the infelicitous, almost gloating, but erroneous, suggestion by France’s president Emmanuel Macron at the summit two weeks ago that the backstop review mechanism would allow him to hold up the UK’s departure from the backstop unless it did a deal to allow French access to UK fisheries.The threat was manna to the Brexiteers. Here was the evidence that the UK could be “held hostage” by the EU. But Macron profoundly misunderstands the treaty backstop review mechanism. The treaty provides that should one party, either the EU or UK, feel that the time has come to quit the backstop - when another agreement has been reached that does its job of protecting the frictionless border - it can apply to do so to the Joint Committee set up to manage the Northern Ireland protocol implementation. Should the joint committee, which has equal representation from the UK and the EU, fail to agree, the issue goes to binding independent arbitration.The treaty makes clear that by law, the arbitrators would only be able to consider two grounds for granting or denying the request - that the parties had genuinely been negotiating an alternative in good faith, and, to quote the British legal opinion, whether the party applying to end the backstop “had acted lawfully in reaching a view about whether the protocol was necessary to achieve its objectives”.While certainly not a unilateral right to withdraw from the backstop, the provision does ensure that an unreasonable veto by a member state or the EU itself, either in setting the bar too high or prevaricating in talks, would not be able to “trap” the UK in a backstop or customs union. The absence of a fishing agreement would certainly not be grounds acceptable to arbitrators. A “reassurance” declaration at this week’s summit by the 27 emphasising the role of and independence of arbitrators and of the scope of their mandate in any review of the backstop, could help to clarify the treaty provisions, without changing them, and should be able to answer the “held hostage” fears of at least some of Mrs May’s critics.The UK and the EU have both made clear repeatedly that they believe that a comprehensive future framework relationship which would do the job of the backstop can be agreed. Eventually. It is necessary now to come up with a means of safeguarding and guaranteeing the frictionless border in the interim. Any “reassurance” declaration from the summit must start and end from that point.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Once, that material filled the entire universe, scientists think – during the first few microseconds after the Big Bang, before there were atoms.The researchers found they were able to generate droplets of that strange matter, and it expanded to form into three separate geometric patterns.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCreated with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Baby mice tears could be used in pest controlA study from the University of Tokyo has found that the tears of baby mice cause female mice to be less interested in the sexual advances of males218 Final warning to limit climate catastropheThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued a report which projects the impact of a rise in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius and warns against a higher increase318 Nobel prize for evolution chemistsThe nobel prize for chemistry has been awarded to three chemists working with evolution.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Our experimental result has brought us much closer to answering the question of what is the smallest amount of early universe matter that can exist, said Jamie Nagle\u0026nbspfrom the University of Colorado at Boulder, one of the many researchers who contributed towards the experiment.The cosmic mystery that remains at the heart of our universeScientists first began research on this strange matter in 2000, when they smashed pieces of gold atoms together and threw out temperatures that were trillions of degrees Celsius. In the incredibly hot soup that it generated, the particles that make up all protons and neutrons broke apart and began to flow, suggesting that generating the new kinds of matter would be possible.Researchers developed that technique so that they could be made more precisely, generating the quark gluon plasma by smashing together only two protons – something that scientists didn\u0027t think was possible.They found that if you expanded those experiments you could push the droplets into each other, which formed exactly the kinds of unusual shapes that scientists were predicting.Imagine that you have two droplets that are expanding into a vacuum, said Nagle.\u0026nbspIf the two droplets are really close together, then as they\u0027re expanding out, they run into each other and push against each other, and that\u0027s what creates this pattern.Scientists hope to use the findings to explore how the quark gluon plasma – when it first arrived, in the earliest miliseconds of the universe – quickly cooled and became the first atoms ever to exist.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Crucially, he knew when to fall silent.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut he also had an acute sense of fun. Occasionally permitting\u0026nbsphimself a dry chuckle – as when the alarm sounded on his digital watch and a panellist quipped it must be his bedtime – Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas able to lay down the law when it mattered, evicting a heckler just last year after they began barracking Remain campaigner Gina Miller.Other celebrated encounters he oversaw during his tenure included Ian\u0026nbspHislop\u0026nbsptackling Mary Archer over her husband’s part in dragging the\u0026nbspConservative Party through the mud, Nigel Farage at daggers drawn with Eddie Izzard over immigration\u0026nbspand Eric Pickles facing a hostile crowd during the expenses scandal.Fiona Bruce confirmed as new Question Time hostThroughout, he remained the model professional.“Dimbleby has become virtually inscrutable,” Ben\u0026nbspSummerskill\u0026nbspwrote in The Observer in 2001. “Even his closest colleagues say they find it almost impossible to ine who he might vote for.”Equally adept interviewing John Lydon\u0026nbspas he was John Prescott, Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas on superb form in 2009 when BNP leader Nick Griffin was invited on to Question Time, a matter of huge controversy. The presenter handled the occasion by simply putting his questions forward and allowing the man’s absurdity to speak for itself.Asking the far-right politician about Holocaust denial, he pressed him:\u0026nbsp“Why are you smiling? It’s not a particularly amusing issue.”That same year, Dimbleby\u0026nbspmissed a show for the first time in his career when he was briefly knocked unconscious by a rearing bullock he was attempting to load into a trailer on his Sussex farm. John Humphrys stepped in to the hot seat.In addition to Question Time, Dimbleby has taken part in every BBC general election broadcast since 1979, his famous calm\u0026nbsptested in 1987 when Robin Day unexpectedly threw him a link and caught him out live on camera with a mouthful of Mars Bar. He rowed back on his retirement in 2017 to bump the unlucky Huw Edwards from the desk, apparently unable to resist the excitement of one last ride.\u0026nbspHe has also regularly hosted the BBC’s coverage of America’s presidential elections, memorably sparring with Gore Vidal during the Obama-McCain race of 2008, amused and genial while the writer was on cantankerous form, pretending not to know who he was and asking:\u0026nbsp“May I talk the facts of life to you?”The BBC has made good use of his gravitas for great occasions of state, inviting him to provide the commentary for Remembrance Sunday, the funerals of Princess Diana, the Queen Mother and Margaret Thatcher, New Year’s Eve 1999, Queen Elizabeth II’s Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the Brexit referendum of 2016.“The British people have spoken – we are out,”\u0026nbsphe concluded that night,\u0026nbspeffectively firing\u0026nbspthe starting pistol on the madcap bureaucratic chaos that has since ensued.Like his father Richard during the Second World War and its aftermath, David Dimbleby found himself providing the public face of the corporation, and uniquely suited to it. He might\u0026nbsp have equally become an MP, his privileged upbringing leading him to study politics, philosophy and economics at Christ Church, Oxford, the usual route to the hustings.Dimbleby\u0026nbsphas also developed a nice sideline in national heritage documentaries, fronting A Picture of Britain (2005), How We Built Britain (2007) and Britain and the Sea (2013) and\u0026nbspbeen tipped as a potential director-general or chairman of the BBC at various stages without ever quite making the leap.It’s Question Time though with which he is indelibly associated.\u0026nbspLoved for his deafening ties – electric pink is all in a day’s work – Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas always extremely game when it came to promoting the show on Facebook, wiggling his hips to “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” by the Rolling Stones and even performing a Brexit rap: “We’ve triggered Article 50May’s letter was niftyMichel Barnier looks shiftyAre we going to have to be thriftyWith a recession in 2050?”This underrated side of his character perhaps explains the Dimblebot.\u0026nbspA spoof mechanoid alter ego offering a droll running commentary on Question Time via Twitter since 2009, the Dimblebot\u0026nbsptweets in block capitals to his “DIMBLETS” every week, hailing the work of “BIO-DIMBLEBY” as the real presenter\u0026nbsp“DEFEATS” his guests and members of the audience in debate.Adored online for his “DIMBLE-DANCE” and Teletext-style website, it is rumoured that members of the extended Dimbleby\u0026nbspclan buy each other merchandise from the site for Christmas, so delighted are they by the send-up of the patriarch.When Prescott raised the Dimblebot\u0026nbspwith the host and his unlikely online celebrity live on air in 2011, he responded with a laugh:\u0026nbsp“We’re having a serious discussion here but I do know I’m called ‘Dimblebot’ and I know there’s a Dimble-dance and I can do it, too… But this is neither the time nor the place!”Whether the creators are assembling a BRUCEBOT to succeed the decommissioned avatar of\u0026nbspBIO-DIMBLEBY\u0026nbspis as yet unknown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Earlier this year, Samsung released another advert making fun of the design, featuring the same man now carrying a child with a similarly unconventional hairdo.With the release date for the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspanticipated for early 2019, the trickle of leaks and rumours surrounding the highly-anticipated device is turning into a stream, with the latest potentially revealing how the South Korean tech giant will negate the notch.Notorious leaker Evan Blass\u0026nbspshared designs of what a case manufacturer expected of the Galaxy S10, which featured three models for the lineup.As expected from previous leaks, the single lens devices have a hole in the screen to cater for the camera.The S10+ model, which will feature two lenses, makes use of two separate holes at the top centre of\u0026nbspthe screen in order to avoid the notch design.In a follow-up tweet, Mr Blass said: Usually I\u0027m a big fan of symmetry, but in this case, I hope the cutouts are offset from center as in the examples shown off at SDC.EDELSONAFPGetty Images)Other rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S10\u0026nbspinclude a self-healing screen that could potentially put an end to scratched displays.A patent for a screen containing a self-healing property was revealed earlier this year, which described how such technology could be used in a portable electronic device such as a smart phone or tablet.The Galaxy S10\u0026nbspis set to launch on the 10th anniversary of Samsung\u0027s first flagship smartphone but it isn\u0027t the only high-end phone it plans to release next year.A foldable phone was unveiled in Ocober\u0026nbspat the firm\u0027s developer conference, with Samsung describing it as the foundation of the smartphone of tomorrow.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our updated approach means the public will be better able to make informed choices about CAM charities and whether they wish to support them or use their services.”He added: “Our review was not about whether CAM is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ or should be made available through public health provision – that is a matter for others. And nor do we expect our outcome necessarily to please all those with strong views about CAM generally. Our focus is on the integrity of the register of charities. We know the public place value on the concept of charity, and we must ensure that the register of charities is accurate and that only organisations that are, in law, charities are registered as such.”In the Charity Commission’s response to the consultation on CAM status, the organisation wrote: “Registration of a charity is acceptance that the organisation meets the legal test for being a charity, including that it is established for exclusively charitable purposes for the public benefit. Public benefit is based on evidence. In registering a CAM organisation as a charity we are not endorsing any treatment or confirming its efficacy but confirming that the organisation meets the test for charitable status including that of benefit to the public.”There is no universally agreed definition of what constitutes a CAM, and practices such as massage, acupuncture, tai chi, and drinking green tea may all be considered as such.NHS stops funding homeopathy at major alternative medicine hospitalThe British Homeopathic Association (BHA), a charity which aims to encourage and enable patient access to homeopathic remedies, appears not to be concerned about the results of the review.Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the BHA, told The Independent: “As a patient focused charity we are pleased to see the emphasis of the Charity Commission’s long-awaited outcome report is about ensuring that CAM organisations are subject to the same governance and legal requirements as other charities on the register.“The BHA was established in 1902 and our charitable status is not only a fundamental part of our identity, it also means that members of the public can have confidence that we are meeting the public benefit and legal requirements set by our governing body.”Homeopathic treatments are separate from science-based western medicine, and are based on ideas developed by German doctor Samuel Hahnemann in the 1790s\u0026nbspand early 1800s.Hahnemann’s key principles are based on theories that a substance which causes particular symptoms can also be used to take away those symptoms. This is usually done through a process of dilution and shaking\u0026nbspcalled “succession”. Remedies may often therefore be made from a substance that has been repeatedly diluted with water, until there is almost none, or absolutely none of the original substance remaining.Created with Sketch.NHS at 70: Pride and worry as free health service celebrates birthday Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalNurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalCommon ailments homeopathy is said to “treat”, include a broad spectrum of physical and psychological conditions including bruises, toothaches, nausea, coughs and colds, asthma and depression.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped.

Everyone’s imagination of what they’re doing now is better.”Friends enduring popularity has meant demand for a revival has been in huge demand. Netflix recently paid a reported $100 million to keep the show on their streaming service.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He later stepped down from the role\u0026nbspbecause I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. He also apologised to the LGBT+ community for my insensitive words from my past.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Oscars might give up on having a host altogetherAll the contenders to replace Kevin Hart as Oscars hostNick Cannon defends Kevin Hart by re-posting other comedians\u0027 tweets​Among the 2009-11 tweets was a now-deleted post that read: “Yo if my son comes home \u0026amp try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head \u0026amp say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay’.”People also resurfaced a video from a 2010 standup special, in which Hart delivered an extended joke based on the fear his three-year-old son will be gay. In 2015, Hart revealed that he turned down a role in 2008’s Tropic Thunder because the character was gay and his behaviour was “real flagrant”, before adding that he’d never be able to play a gay character in the future.However, several LGBT+ comedians stepped forward to point out what they perceived as a difference between Hart’s comments and those by Schumer, Silverman and Handler.\u0026nbsp“I\u0027m a gay comic who has had his voice amplified by @SarahKSilverman @amyschumer and @chelseahandler,” Guy Branum wrote. “I\u0027ve been close enough with two of these comics to say I didn\u0027t like gay jokes that they did, and they respected \u0026amp engaged,” he tweeted. “I wish @KevinHart4real \u0026amp @NickCannon could do the same.”\u0026nbsp“Sarah has practically gone joke by joke through her old catalog and apologized for material she wouldn\u0027t say now, with specific reasoning,” Louis Virtel tweeted. “She has never been above criticism and it is ridiculous she\u0027s being compared to him.”Billy Eichner also provided his thoughts in a note shared via Twitter. While he tweeted that he appreciated Hart\u0027s apology, he also called for all comedy stars not to use such hurtful language.“People have been tweeting me \u0026nbspfor my thoughts on Nick Cannon’s tweets. I obviously can’t speak for the entire LGBTQ community. But here’s my personal opinion for those who care, which is probably not that many people. #SundayFunday“People have been tweeting me about Nick Cannon\u0027s tweets and the use of the F-word by the comedians that he points out,” the Billy on the Street star wrote. “I think Nick\u0027s point is a compelling one. I obviously do not and cannot speak for the entire LGBT community (obviously). But here\u0027s my personal opinion: Just don\u0027t use the word. It\u0027s as simple as that.”Neither Schumer nor Handler has commented on Cannon\u0027s tweets. However, Silverman recently re-shared a Twitter thread by author Greg Hogben with a heart emoji. She also replied to a social media user, who wrote,“but that whole part where you replied to a tweet where you used a word with ‘I don\u0027t use that word.\u0027”Hart\u0027s replacement has not been named by the Academy.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But\u0026nbspthere were also the added dangers of terrorist groups such as Isis, and the “bellicose nature of populism and nationalism” that seek to exploit mass migration, which many see as an existential threat to Europe.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) address came in a week of extraordinary political tumult, with the survival of Theresa May’s government in question and the Brexit process in disarray.He began his speech at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in London saying: “Without getting overly excited I guess there’s never been a better week for a CDS to be controversial.”Britain’s defence strategy is being overhauled for the tech ageGen Carter continued: “We live in a multi-polar world of competing powers, with erging views on how the world should work, different values, a sense of historic entitlement and even some scores to settle.“Meanwhile, the character of politics and warfare is evolving rapidly, driven by the pervasiveness of information and the rate of technological change. Our competitors have become masters at exploiting the seams between peace and war what constitutes a weapon in this ‘grey zone’, below the threshold of conventional war, no longer has to go ‘bang’.”He pointed to a worrying lack of knowledge or interest among the public about how current geopolitical issues have evolved.“Of course, people don’t really study history any longer,” he said, pointing to a\u0026nbsprecent survey of 2,000 people about the First World War. “Fifty per cent thought Winston Churchill was the prime minister at the time, and 10 per cent\u0026nbspthought it was Margaret Thatcher\u0026nbsp20 per cent\u0026nbspthought we were fighting the French\u0026nbsp6 per cent\u0026nbspthought it was President Kennedy’s assassination that triggered the war.\u0026nbspAnd when asked what the bloodiest battle of the war was, 16 per cent\u0026nbspvoted for Pearl Harbour, 8 per cent\u0026nbspfor Independence Day, 7 per cent\u0026nbspfor Hastings and 5 per cent\u0026nbspfor Helm’s Deep – yes that’s 100 of the 2,000 who were asked – who thought it was a battle in the Lord of the Rings trilogy”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Armed police restrain a man inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament in LondonA demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, WestminsterA pro-brexit demonstrator speaks into a megaphone at the Brexit betrayal march in London.

We no longer have the same depth of mutual understanding, and the tried and tested diplomatic instruments and conventions that used to be a feature of international relations, such as confidence-building measures, arms-reduction negotiations, public monitoring and inspection of each other’s military activity, are not what they once were.”In purely military terms, he stated: “Countries like Russia and China have studied our strengths and invested carefully in new methods and capabilities that are designed to exploit weaknesses: cyber\u0026nbspballistic and cruise missiles low-yield nuclear weapons space and counterspace weapons electronic warfare integrated air and missile defence systems multi-barrelled thermobaric rocket launchers linked digitally to drone targeting systems new conventional capability such as low-signature submarines, modern aircraft and armoured vehicles.”These are the Brexit security risks you really need to worry aboutWhen it comes to sophisticated weapons, “worryingly, many of these systems are now in the hands of proxy states. No longer can we guarantee our freedom of action from air or sea and on land”, he said.Looking to the future, Gen Carter said: “We will need to be clear in a post-Brexit\u0026nbspworld what role we want to play in the world – for example, is our ambition to be globally deployable or global? And what level of activity should we plan for? We have to find the right balance between ‘fight tonight’ and ‘fight tomorrow’, as this is essential for the long-term sustainability of our armed forces.”The government’s\u0026nbspModernising Defence Programme, due to be made public soon, said Gen Carter, has sought to address the\u0026nbspchallenges. “We need to mobilise to meet today’s threats we must modernise to meet future threats and we must transform ourselves to become the agile and adaptive organisation that the future demands,” he said.Chief of the Defence StaffShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This occurred after hydraulic fracturing had finished for the day. According to recent research by the University of Liverpool the impact would be like dropping a melon.

Well integrity has been checked and verified.”The company began pumping again this week after spending November working through their “wider hydraulic fracturing plan”, including conducting tests and analysis at the site.Environmental groups have passionately opposed the Lancashire site, which marks the first time fracking has taken place in the UK for seven years.“Within a day of Cuadrilla restarting fracking in Lancashire, there has already been another earthquake which means they’ve had to down tools,” said\u0026nbspFriends of the Earth campaigner Tony Bosworth.“It appears that they cannot frack without triggering tremors.

It’s clear that we now need the most precious commodity of all: time.”Sir John, who was prime minister from 1990 to 1997 and has backed a Final Say referendum on the Brexit outcome, called for “serious and profound reflection” on the country’s situation.“There will be a way through the present morass there always is. But in our national interest we now need to take some time to find it and I hope and I trust that we will,” he said.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.With the prime minister in Brussels pleading with EU leaders to offer further concessions, he said there was “wiggle room” to find a compromise but warned it was “probably very limited”.The call came as Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, also argued that whether to head for a no-deal Brexit “remains in the hands of the UK”.The option is there to revoke Article 50, the option is there to extend Article 50 and while there may not be a majority for anything, or at least any deal, at the moment in the House of Commons, I do believe that there is a majority that the UK should not be plunged into a no-deal scenario,” he told the Dail, the Irish parliament.“It is in their hands at any point in time to take the threat of no-deal off the table, either by revoking Article 50 or, if that is a step too far, by extending it.”In fact, the two-year Article 50 period can only be extended – beyond Brexit day on 29 March – with the agreement of all other 27 EU members.The EU has suggested it would be willing to take that step to allow a second referendum to be held. In contrast, Brussels cannot block a revocation of Article 50, the European Court ruled.Richard Branson: Hard Brexit would be \u0027devastating\u0027 for holidaymakersDavid Cameron insists he does not regret calling Brexit referendumMay could delay vote on Brexit deal for more than a monthMay should resign if she loses no-confidence vote, MPs saySir John suggested revoking the notice would allow the UK to “stop the clock” – although the Court said it should be “unequivocal and unconditional, suggesting it could not be used as a negotiating tactic.He also warned about the potential for a return to violence if a hard Irish border returns.“The belief that because we have no violence in Northern Ireland for 18 years that it is gone forever is fatuous. Peace is never definitively forever. Things can go wrong,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We must do nothing to give them the opportunity of doing it and the imposition of a hard border is an opportunity for them to do it,” Sir John said.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

She will return to Brussels on Thursday and Friday to attend a meeting of the European Council, which all 28 EU leaders will attend.After meeting with Ms May, the German chancellor\u0026nbspAngela Merkel said there was “no way to change” the agreement, echoing the sentiments of other member states.Speaking separately in Brussels, French European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau\u0026nbsptold reporters: “We’ve done a lot to help the UK, this withdrawal agreement is the only possible agreement, and we’ve done a lot of concessions to reach it. We sincerely hope that there can be a majority to ratify the withdrawal agreement but we have to stand ready for a no deal and we are preparing for it.”European Council president Donald Tusk, who met with Ms May in Brussels separately to Mr\u0026nbspJuncker, said he and the prime minister had had a “long and frank discussion”. He added that it was “clear that the EU27 wants to help” but that “the question is how”.\u0026nbspMs May said she believed there was “a shared determination to deal with this issue\u0026nbspand address this problem”.Theresa May’s Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated, Irish PM saysTheresa May’s backstop veto plan ‘would rip up withdrawal agreement’Though EU leaders and governments have said they will not renegotiate the deal, some have said they would like to help Ms May pass the plan through parliament by providing “reassurances” and “clarification”.Ms May appeared happy with this, telling reporters in Brussels: “We don’t want the backstop to be used and if it is we want to be certain that it is only temporary. It is those assurances that I will be seeking from fellow leaders over the coming days.”Tory Eurosceptic\u0026nbsprebels and the DUP have made clear that the backstop would have to be removed from the deal, time-limited, or\u0026nbspthe UK given the power to end it unilaterally if they are to back it. Without their support Ms May has little chance of passing the deal.Her admission that she is unlikely to be able to secure substantial changes to the agreement is likely to enrage Eurosceptics, amid reports from Westminster\u0026nbspthat a no-confidence vote from her own party could be looming.Juncker meet in Brussels on Tuesday evening (Reuters)Speaking in the European Parliament in Strasbourg in the morning, commission president Mr Juncker said: “The backstop is necessary for Ireland. Ireland will never be left alone.”He described Brexit as “a surprise guest” at the European Council summit scheduled for this end of this week, adding: “I am surprised because we had reached an agreement on 25 November together with the government of the UK.”Created with Sketch.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

MPs should vote down the withdrawal agreement tomorrow and then support a People\u0027s Vote. If the country support continuing EU membership the court has told us we can revoke Art 50 and keep our existing terms. The threat to this strategy comes from Labour whose posturing around mythical renegotiation and a general election would waste the time we need to organise the referendum.The Commons committee on standards has just published its response to Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report into bullying and harassment of parliament\u0027s staff, writes my colleague\u0026nbspAshley\u0026nbspCowburn.It says greater freedoms should be given greater freedom to trigger investigations into historical investigations against MPs.The publication examined initial proposals for the House of Commons\u0027 standards system following Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report, which lifted the lid on a toxic culture at Westminster.The committee report said: We agree with the commissioner\u0027s view that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry relating to events more than seven years earlier is an unacceptable encroachment on her independence.We therefore recommend that this requirement should be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this.We believe there should be no exceptions to the general principle that the committee does not seek to direct the commissioner\u0027s operational decision-making.For that reason, we also recommend that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry into a former member should also be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this also.Labour MP Kate Green, who chairs the committee, said: It is vital that trust in the process is rebuilt, following the criticisms in Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report.Whilst there is clearly much more to be done, our recommendations will make an important step forward towards a fairer, more independent and credible system.The Standards Committee is unique in having an equal number of MPs and lay members on it, and these proposals will ensure that the skills and expertise of the lay members can help to hold MPs to account in the most effective way.No 10 has confirmed that there will be a Cabinet conference call at 11.30am but insisted this\u0026nbspis to update ministers on Theresa May\u0027s conversations with EU leaders over the weekend,\u0026nbsprather than about any plans to call\u0026nbspoff tomorrow\u0027s vote.\u0026nbspA spokesperson said the vote will go ahead as planned and Ms May is confident of winning it.This is from our deputy political editor, Rob Merrick, following this morning\u0027s No 10 briefing with journalists here in Westminster...\u0026nbspDowning Street has announced that urgent talks are talking place now with cabinet ministers, amid continued suggestions that tomorrow’s ‘meaningful vote’ could yet be pulled.Theresa May’s spokeswoman insisted that was not the purpose of the sudden conference call, telling journalists: “The vote is going ahead as planned.”Instead, the talks were intended to update the cabinet on talks the prime minister held over the weekend with various EU leaders, she said.The spokeswoman refused to go into what was discussed with EU leaders, saying it would not right to do so before cabinet ministers were informed.However, she continued to insist the withdrawal agreement had been “agreed and negotiated” – and that reopening it could backfire on the UK, by allowing some EU countries to push for tougher terms.Ms May will be in Brussels on Thursday, for an EU summit. Asked if, as rumoured, she could travel there before Thursday, the spokeswoman replied: “There are no plans to do that.”\u0026nbspOver the weekend, the prime minister spoke with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Junker, heads of the EU council and commission respectively, as well as with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and the prime ministers of Ireland and the Netherlands.NEW: Asked if the vote is being called off, one Cabinet source tells me: Looks it.BREAKING: Theresa May will give a statement in the Commons on Brexit at 3.30pm. All the signs are that the vote is being called off.BREAKING: Theresa May has called off tomorrow\u0027s vote, a very well-placed source has told me.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has responded to tomorrow\u0027s vote being delayed. He said:\u0026nbsp“The government has decided Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour.\u0026nbspWe have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst of all worlds deal was going to be rejected by Parliament because it is damaging for Britain. Instead, she ploughed ahead when she should have gone back to Brussels to renegotiate or called an election so the public could elect a new government that could do so.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We don\u0027t have a functioning government. While Theresa May continues to botch Brexit, our public services are at breaking point and our communities suffer from dire under-investment.\u0026nbsp“Labour’s alternative plan for a jobs first deal must take centre stage in any future talks with Brussels.”Steve Baker, the Eurosceptic ERG\u0027s main organiser, says:\u0026nbspThis is essentially a defeat of the prime minister\u0027s Brexit deal. The terms of the withdrawal agreement were so bad that they didn\u0027t dare put it to Parliament for a vote. This isn\u0027t the mark of a stable government or a strong plan.\u0026nbspHe added\u0026nbspParliament should be been allowed to voice its concerns about the proposed withdrawal agreement. Without a clear rejection of the terms by MPs, the prime minister has kicked the can down the road and the EU is very unlikely to re-negotiate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But at the moment I’m looking at who is in the papers, who can we get behind, but it shouldn’t be about the personality it should be about the country.”\u0026nbspMs McVey\u0026nbspsaid she would support the prime minister if she were to go back to Brussels and try and renegotiate the deal, in particular around the Irish backstop and the £39bn ‘orce bill’ that Ms May’s withdrawal agreement accounts for.Mr Raab was interviewed on the same show, and asked if he would rule out a run, he said: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out, but I’m just not going to get sucked in to that debate.“The public and people watching this show would think it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in that speculation.”He would not comment when asked if he would stand aside for fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson to run for the leadership.It\u0026nbspcame as comments the government was hit by another resignation over the Brexit plan –\u0026nbspWill Quince, a ministerial aide to defence secretary Gavin Williamson.He hit out at the backstop plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland, saying it could result in the UK being “tied to the negotiating table for years, until we agree to anything in desperation” to get out of the situation.For her part, Ms May warned Tory MPs they risk handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10 unless they back her Brexit deal in an interview with Mail on Sunday, .“It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal,” she told the Mail on Sunday.“We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country.“As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.”Reports suggested Ms May could make an emergency trip to Brussels ahead of a planned summit on Thursday in an effort to secure further concessions in an effort to win over critics of her plan.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But, since then, the Mr\u0026nbspPichai\u0026nbsphas held closed door meetings with members of\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbspto discuss what Republicans have branded as liberal bias at Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialFollow updates from the hearing below and watch a\u0026nbsplive stream of the testimony here.Hello and welcome to our live blog of the congressional testimony of Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\u0026nbspWe are waiting on Mr Pichai to arrive.In attendance in Washington today is Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist who has had plenty of problems with social media over the past year.\u0026nbspJones was in attendance the last time tech CEOs came to testify before Congress, and tends to get into squabbles with folks on a regular basis.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ll see if any Jones news comes out of today\u0027s hearing when the Judiciary Committee calls a recess.Mr Goodlatte has opened the hearing, and recognized House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as a witness.\u0026nbspMr McCarthy has thanked Mr Pichai, and called Google one of the most valuable companies in the world.Mr McCarthy cited a\u0026nbspWall Street Journal\u0026nbspstatistic that said that 90 per cent of internet searches goes through Google.\u0026nbspHe has also said that there is a widening gap of trust between users and technology companies. He went on to suggest that political biases must not seep into Google\u0027s search product.Chairman Goodlatte says that Google is able to collect an amount of data that would make the NSA blush.\u0026nbspHe said that most Americans probably have no idea how much information Google might be collecting about them when they use the platform.Chairman Goodlatte has now said he is interested in how Google handles objectionable content.\u0026nbspHe also has mentioned algorithmic screening, and the dangers that tinkering with that system could have. He then claimed that some Google employees have considered tinkering with the algorithm.Chairman Goodlatte is hitting on a lot of issues here, and has now mentioned that Android smartphones are able to collect a massive amount of data from users during the course of the day.\u0026nbspThat includes tracking data on movement, and even the mode of transport that someone may take.Ranking member Jerry Nadler is now giving his opening remarks, after Mr Goodlatte thanked Mr Pichai for attending the hearing.\u0026nbspMr Nadler has called the idea that Google and other tech companies have anti-conservative bias a fantasy. He said that he expects Republicans to bring up anecdotes, but that they will provide little evidence of an anti-conservative bias.\u0026nbspMr Nadler, on the other hand, has suggested that they should be concerned about online efforts to spread disinformation. He referenced the 2016 election, in which Russia attacked the US elections in favour of President Donald Trump.Mr Pichai is describing his childhood and the changes that technology had on his life before he moved to the United States 25 years ago.\u0026nbspHe has been the CEO of Google for the past three years.Mr Pichai is noting that Google is a major driver of jobs in the US, and that the company is able to help businesses all across the country.\u0026nbspHe noted that the company drives a massive portion of the US economy. He also said that Google works with the government.\u0026nbspI\u0027m proud to\u0026nbspsay that we do and we will continue to work with the government to keep our company safe and secure, Mr Pichai said.Mr Goodlatte has asked if Android phones send information to servers every few minutes, including location, altitude, temperature, and other data points.\u0026nbspMr Pichai has said that Google goes out of its way to give people the ability to control their privacy.\u0026nbspHe said that users have a choice on what data they send, and that some apps — like fitness apps — require certain data collection.Mr Pichai has said that Google offers privacy checkups in order for users to review what information Google collects on them.\u0026nbspHe said that users are able to review data and then to decide if data is stored or\u0026nbsp deleted. He also said that users can take their data with them if they choose to use other services.\u0026nbspWe want to make this work in a sustainable way, Mr Pichai said of platforms like YouTube, and ensuring that the content is agreeable.Please allow a moment for the live blog to updateShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

A certain amount of arrogance came in,’\u0026nbspsays opposition leader Rahul GandhiClick to followThe IndependentIndian Congress party supporters hold their party flag as they celebrate in AhmedabadThe ruling party of India’s prime minister Narendra Modi has suffered a major setback just a few months before a general election, trailing the rival Congress\u0026nbspParty in three key state polls.In the last set of state elections before the whole country goes to the ballot box in spring, preliminary results showed bad defeats for Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, and the vote hanging in the balance in Madhya Pradesh.All three are big, populous states that handed dozens of seats to the BJP as Mr Modi swept to victory in the last general election in 2014.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAs much as the results were a blow to the ruling party, they will provide a big boost to the image of both Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi, who has come under particularly vicious attack from supporters of the present government.As counting continued, Mr Gandhi addressed the media to claim victory in all three of the big states. “The election results are out, and I congratulate Congress workers and the people. It’s the people’s win, the youth’s win,” he said.India’s Modi faces calls for resignation over French jet dealMr Gandhi said the BJP had lost the vote in the mostly rural states because he “refused to listen” to what farmers and young people living outside cities had to say.Hundreds of thousands of people have joined farmers’ protests in the capital Delhi in recent months, demanding the government put in place higher minimum pricing for their goods. At the same time, Mr Modi has been accused of failing to meet his promise of providing a jobs boon in rural economies.“He refused to listen to the heartbeat of the country. A certain amount of arrogance came in,” Mr Gandhi said.It was not all good news for Congress. Two smaller states also returned election results on Tuesday – one, Mizoram, was the only Congress-controlled state in the northeast. Both states saw Congress’s vote decimated by double-digit numbers of seats in favour of local parties.The results highlight\u0026nbsphow Congress still needs to muster a strong, erse alliance of parties if they are to\u0026nbsphave any hope of challenging the might of the BJP next year.This is why India is running out of patience with ModiModi visits troops as India celebrates Diwali festival of lights India’s BJP lashes out at Francois Hollande ‘international conspiracy’India’s Modi leads 50,000 in dawn exercises on International Yoga DayIndian PM, ministers and celebrities join in new fitness craze“To say these results indicate the BJP will lose in 2019 would be jumping the gun,” said Ajay Mehra, a retired political scientist at Delhi University. “But there is clearly a growing desperation that things are not going the way Mr Modi and the BJP would expect.“The Modi magic is on the wane. People are no longer being taken in by this image of him as the ultimate leader.”Analysts had been expecting some anti-incumbency sentiments to manifest themselves in the three big states up for grabs on Tuesday, with the BJP trying for a record fourth term in a row in both Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.Nonetheless, they are still seen as the sort of heartlands Mr Modi will need to hold onto if he is to win again next year. His party won 62 of the 65 parliamentary seats available in these three states in 2014.“We’ve all voted for Congress this time and our candidate is winning here,” said Bishnu Prasad Jalodia, a wheat farmer in Madhya Pradesh, where the Congress was ahead of the BJP and only slightly short of the majority needed to rule.“BJP ignored us farmers, they ignored those of us at the bottom of the pyramid,” he said.The BJP sought to downplay the results, saying state votes would not necessarily dictate what happens in next year’s general election.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomes British Prime Minister Theresa May at the chancellery in Berlin.

Let’s look forward with confidence.”Javid has said he will launch a leadership challengeTheresa Mays Brexit deal collapses and shes ousted as Prime Minister.He has reportedly begun to gather support from ministers and is creating a team to help him bid to become the first non-white PM.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are reported to also be seeking support for their own leadership bids.One Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Sajid is tapping us up. He is very direct, but he’s not offering jobs yet, which wouldn’t be a good look”.Another senior Tory disclosed: “He told me that Theresa’s Brexit deal is s***, she’ll be forced out when it falls, and he is then going to declare immediately”.Javid has said he would support a no-deal Brexit and has been backed by leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom.The government has been rocked by the scandal of Windrush-generation immigrants who have been treated as criminals by the Home Office despite living here legally for decades.Commonwealth citizens were encouraged to move to Britain from the s to s, but many were later unable to prove their right to be here. Some lost jobs, were denied healthcare or were threatened with deportation.Mr Javid said his family could easily have been caught up in the same situation after moving to the UK half a century ago.He told The Sunday : “I thought that could be my mum, my dad, my uncle ...it could be me.”He added: “I was really concerned when I first started hearing and reading about some of the issues.It immediately impacted me. I’m a second-generation migrant.My parents came to this country from Pakistan, just like the Windrush generation.”His comments heaped more pressure on Ms Rudd, but he also defended the government, urging people to look at the bigger picture and his colleagues efforts to put things right.After being made Home Secretary he said his most urgent task is sorting out the Windrush mess and his immigration policy will be fair and will treat people with respect and decency.The Sun revealed how Mr Javid grew up on Britain’s most crime ridden street, which led to his brother Bas Javid joining the police.Bas is now a chief superintendent in the West Mids Police Force, and his brother drew on the coppers  years of force experience in his first major speech.Describing his shock at the abuse he saw hurled at his brother as he tried to work, Sajid said: Over the years, I’ve heard what he has to say about policing.I know the tricky situations he’s been in. He’s been hurt more times than I want to know from being assaulted on duty.I’ve seen the impact the job has on his family le."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000402655327-e1528307444665.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what brexit backstop plan theresa may eu irish border latest","story":"Heres our guide to the plan and what it means for Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , EU leaders approved an agreement on the UKs withdrawal from the EU.MPs were due to vote on the deal in parliament today, but yesterday the PM announced she was delaying the vote.There was a three-hour long debate in the house of commons yesterday during which May was asked many questions about what will happen with the Irish border.She will attempt to reopen negotiations with Brussels about the Irish border backstop, however they have said negotiations are now closed.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has been ordered to publish all the legal advice hes given Mrs May on her proposed deal - but has only handed over a summary instead.It concluded the proposed backstop would stop Britain making trade deals around the world in a separate legal document.Addressing the issue of the backstop - which will keep Britain in the customs uniontheres no other way to protect the Irish border - the Attorney General said: There is no unilateral right for either party to terminate this arrangement.This means thatno superseding agreement can be reached within the implementation period, the protocol would be activated and in international law would subsist, evennegotiations had broken down.How likely that is to happen is a political question, to which the answer will no doubt depend partly on the extent to which it is in either partys interests to remain indefinitely within its arrangements.We are indefinitely committing to itit came into force. There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004544107481.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit vote theresa may james forsyth","story":"They fear thatit goes ahead, she will lose by a margin so large that it could capsize the Government.One Secretary of State tells me it would be “group suicide” to press ahead with the vote.Number  is adamant that no decision on whether to find a way to avoid the vote has been taken yet. Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is not the serious, sensible, unying compromise he believes. Nor does it deliver on the referendum.Joining EFTA — part of the European Economic Area — alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein would leave us nominally “out” of the EU. But that’s pretty much where it ends.We would still be in the single market, accepting free movement, with a supposed “brake” we would never deploy.Worse, we would remain in an EU customs union too, to “avoid” the mythical hard border in Ireland no one will ever build.We would effectively still be EU members  with no vote, nor power to strike our own trade deals — wrecking Brexit’s central economic case.It’s a non-Brexit that only satisfies Remainers. The Leave victory was motivated by a desire for sovereignty, including  control over immigration. This fulfils none of it. It won’t fly.Even a second referendum is better  — though obviously “Remain” cannot be on the ballot, the first vote having ruled it out.CAN the Government not see the obvious conclusion voters draw from its zombie-apocalypse vision of a no-deal Brexit Downing Street trots out these scenarios — medicines, food and water running short and bodies going unburied — like they were inevitable. But it was their job to prepare us. Had they done so from , we would be in good shape.Chancellor Philip Hammond actually considered it irresponsible to spend money on it. The Government, incredibly, feared upsetting Brussels.Now they’re saying: “Brexit’s coming! Look how little we’ve done to be ready.”It is jaw-dropping negligence.He seriously claims Labour could secure all the benefits of the single market while defying its rules, including on immigration, and staying in a customs union while doing our own trade deals.Literally none of it is possible. Yet Corbyn fantasises that Brussels would just surrender to his superior charm and guile.Even as the Tories implode, Labour remains a laughing stock.EX-GCHQ chief Robert Hannigan is right to brand Facebook a threat to democracy.Most users cannot see its misuse of their data or the danger of the fake news it spreads.

Freedom is slavery! Ignorance is strength! Parliament speaks for the ­people!In fact, there has never been such a disconnect between our politicians and our people in my letime.Whatever our politicians represent, it is certainly not the ,, men and women who voted to leave the EU.In their party manestos, both the Labour Party and the Conservatives promised to honour the ­referendum result. Liars, liars, liars.Liars who took . per cent of the vote at the last General Election on a promise they so casually break.Liars who will stop the UK ever leaving the EU.They will stop it with Mrs May’s terrible deal — which takes us out of the EU in name only, bound to their rules and subject to their whims but unable to forge our own destiny.Or, more likely, May’s deal will crash and there will be some grubby little con to overturn the referendum result and keep us snugly inside the crumbling EU empire.A “People’s Vote” — that mealy-mouthed euphemism for “Kill Brexit” — is on the cards now.The irony of any “People’s Vote” is that it will be nowhere near as ­representative of the people as the referendum of . That historic poll saw a massive . per cent of the ­electorate vote — a staggering ,, men and women trudging to the polls.You can bet your last euro that millions would not bother a second time.What’s the point when your vote is meaningless  What’s the pointthey are not listening What’s the pointwe have democracy in name only Thanks to Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, smooth as an oil slick, ­Parliament has ensured it has the final say on Brexit, not the people.I think of my late parents. They believed in voting. They saw it as their duty.My parents had profound political dferences — my mum was a hardcore Labour supporter while my dad voted Liberal because he believed the Tory Party was run for the ­benefit of big business and Labour run for the benefit of big unions.But they both believed in democracy because they were from the generation who witnessed all of our freedoms being paid for in blood.My mother and father would shake their heads at the idea of a “People’s Vote”.They would think that the fix was in. And they would be right.Powerful forces have schemed to have their way — an Establishment alliance of a pro-Brussels civil ­service, the House of Lords, the BBC, big business interests in the CBI and all those well-heeled MPs who despise the people who voted Brexit, who believe that ,, of their countrymen are ignorant racist bigots who don’t deserve a vote.David Cameron clearly lied through his teeth when he told the British people that their decision was final.Parliament is lying today when it says it respects the ­referendum result.No — democracy in this country is dying today. History is moving towards the other side now, to the wishes of the ,, who voted to remain.It is a national tragedy that our politicians are such self-serving, moral midgets that there was not one among them — not one! — who could unite our ided nation.MPs must stop pretending they give a flying fig about democracy, freedom or the will of the British people.Because this week Parliament told ,, men and women that the vote is worthless.IN any long-term feud between Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, there can only be one possible winner.Only one Duchess is ever going to be Queen.KATE Beckinsale reveals that her skin regime includes a serum concocted from the discarded fore- skins of South Korean babies – what Sandra Bullock calls “the penis facial”.“After a long flight,” Kate informed Instagram, “I do like to lie down and be covered in a mask of liquefied cloned foreskins – frankly, who doesn’t ”Experts claim skin cells taken from the unwanted bits of Korean baby boysproduces an anti-ageing face cream that makes fine lines disappear.And have you seen Kate, pictured, lately  At , she is shining like a new diamond.

Once so fashionable, loved and trusted, now Clegg is widely despised and derided as a repulsive boil on the face of humanity.A lot like Facebook.Nick Clegg and Facebook deserve each other.It’s like painting a Hitler moustache on the Mona Lisa.UKIP without Nigel Farage  It is going to be like the Rolling Stones without Keith Richards.THE police brought a ray of sunshine into all our lives when they started knocking scooter thieves off their bikes.“Tactical contact” the law calls it. The tactic is used sparingly – just  times over the past year. But it works.In London, robberies by two-wheeled vehicles stood at , at this time last year. Today it is nearly , fewer.Labour’s Diane Abbott, the Shadow Home Secretary, tut-tuts about the police fighting back against the moped muggers. “Knocking people off their bikes is potentially very dangerous,” scolds Abbott. “It shouldn’t be legal for anyone. Police are not above the law.”In any future Labour Government, Diane Abbott would probably be in charge of policing.Andthat grim prospect doesn’t keep the Marxist muppets from Downing Street, then nothing will.ARISE Sir Tyson Fury! Give him the lot.A New Year’s knighthood. BBC Sports Personality Of The Year.

The French would come for our fish and our banks. The Germans would want concessions on EU immigration.Other countries would want more money.It would be a nightmare negotiation. So why do my friends think they must vote for it Because they believe that there is no alternative: that we may not like what has happened – but that we have run out of time and run out of road.It is crucial to understand that this pessimism is just flat wrong.If this deal is voted down on Tuesday – and I devoutly hope it is - we need to do two big things.First we need to change the Withdrawal Agreement, keeping all the sensible things that have been agreed on citizens’ rights, but getting rid of the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.We should use the so-called transition period both to negotiate a big and generous zero tarf zero quota free trade deal, and to solve the technical problems posed by the Northern Ireland border.There is no reason why we should not use that time – almost two years – to put in place the systems that will allow our whole country to come out of both the customs union and the single market, which is what the people were promised both at the referendum and the general election.We should be clear that we will keep back at least half of the £billion until the free trade deal is done.And second it is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business.This should be a take it or leave it offer – and so show that we mean business we must be able to walk away.This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges – and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit, when for two and a half years this government has studiously and deliberately failed to address those logistical problems.It is that failure and that lack of resolve that has so weakened our hand in the talks.Now is the time to get on with it – and remember,we have to go down this route, we will have the entire £billion to spend on it.We need to get our ports ready, hire the staff, ensure that the planes can fly and that companies are helped to transfer their data under any circumstances.I don’t believe for a moment that our EU friends and partners want such an outcome.They have a £ billion surplus with us in goods alone.They don’t want barriers to trade.They want a deal as much as we do.Do you really think that the people of the Calais region would be gratefulthe Paris government took steps to block commercial traffic from the UK Have you seen what is going on in France No one wants disruption of any kind – and the way to avoid it is to get ready to manage it now, with energy and conviction.We can still get a great deal, and I am sure we will.

This deal fulfils those instructions, while protecting jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.If you are in the EU, you have to accept the automatic right of any citizen of any other member state to live and work in your country.This agreement will end that situation and restore the British Government’s power to decide who should settle in our country. We will admit people with the right skills for our economy, regardless of their background.Britain is generous and tolerant, so the rights of EU citizens already living here will be protected, along with the rights of Britons residing in the EU.We will also stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing the British Government to decide on public spending priorities.As I know from my previous job, this Government’s priority is the NHS.

There are couples who struggle to make ends meet, brave single mothers or widows who can’t afford child care, and poor pensioners who often have to help children and grandchildren, as well as people with disabilities.Mr Macron said this Forgotten France has existed for at least  years, and that everything had to be done to help them.Referring to rioting which has seen , arrests across France since November , Mr Macron said: I will not compromise on violence.

We are due to leave the EU on March  next year, deal or no deal — and Parliament cannot agree what to do.Some MPs want the PM to go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Others want to negotiate a dferent deal altogether. Labour wants an election. Die-hard Remainers want another referendum. Many Leavers just want to get out without a deal.And Mrs May insists her deal is the right one, despite knowing it is so unpopular that she couldn’t put it to a vote in the Commons.Whoever gets their way, it is time to strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for an almighty crash. However things end, we are heading for multiple constitutional crises that risk smashing our political system to pieces.Yesterday Mrs May promised more assurances from Brussels about her deal’s so-called “backstop”, in which we will be trapped in a customs union with the EU, and Northern Ireland will be trapped inside the single market.But it is completely implausible that she will be able to negotiate an end to the backstop or the right to simply withdraw from it in future.So convinced was the PM that she could not win this argument with Brussels, she did not propose it during the original talks. The Europeans insist they will not make any legally binding commitments about how the backstop might end.So the only effect of delaying the vote is to take up even more time before March . In other words, the game of chicken between ministers and rebel MPs will get more and more high-risk.The time for MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit will be cut short, the chances of no deal will increase and ministers — because they want to bully Parliament into accepting their deal — will continue to refuse to prepare properly for no deal.And remember what the PM’s deal involves. For nearly two years — but maybe longer — we will pay into the EU budget, accept free movement and respect all European laws.Then, when there is no agreement on the future relationship, we will find ourselves in the backstop. Northern Ireland will effectively be annexed by Brussels. British goods heading for Ulster will be stopped and checked, European goods will be waved through. The EU will decide how other countries can trade with Britain, without our say and regardless of the effects on British jobs. And we will be forced to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice.Our constitution says Parliament is sovereign: Nothing is more powerful than an Act of Parliament, debated and approved by elected representatives.What’s more, no Parliament can “bind its successors”: One generation of MPs cannot dictate what future generations can and cannot decide.Yet the PM’s deal subordinates Parliament to the EU, and does so permanently, with no legal right for Britain to escape its punishing terms. It would leave us as a colony: A country dismembered and incapable of democratic self-government.The remaining options are just as dangerous. Many pro- Europeans want Britain to join the European Economic Area and form a customs union with the EU.Norway Plus, as their plan is now known, would mean Britain accepting even more European laws than the PM proposes, without any say over what they are. For that reason, coupled with the knowledge that it does not avoid the backstop, Norway Plus is even worse than Theresa May’s deal.Yet the “Norwegians” inside the Conservative Party persist. They know there is no majority among Tory MPs for their model but they have a plan.If Mrs May’s deal is rejected and they win a majority for Norway Plus with support from Labour MPs, they can install a caretaker prime minister to deliver it.With a Commons majority for Norway Plus, they believe the Queen would be obliged to appoint their man — David Lidington, perhaps — as PM.The risk to the monarchy of embroiling the Queen in a political controversy of such magnitude seems not to matter to them. One other option, pushed by a handful of Conservatives and many Labour MPs, is to re-run the referendum. Their goal is to remain in the EU after all.The possibility they might lose, the effects on public confidence in our democracy and the instability caused by a narrow remain victory do not matter.For these Europhiles, staying in the EU is more important than the damage they might do to Parliament and to the party system our democracy relies upon.The default option, however,Parliament rejects the PM’s deal, is a no-deal Brexit. That was decided when Parliament passed the Withdrawal Act earlier this year. To override that Act, Parliament must do more than hold a single vote, and the Government must do more than negotiate something .Parliament must amend the Withdrawal Act or pass another Act to set us on a dferent path. If there is any ambiguity, the Supreme Court — whose president, Baroness Hale, has challenged the sovereignty of Parliament in the past — might again play a controversial role.While the Commons is ided, we know a majority of MPs are determined to stop a no-deal Brexit at almost any cost. Some senior Tories say they will vote against the Government in a confidence motion — risking the election of Jeremy Corbyn —it means they can stop leaving without a deal.It is probable we are heading for Norway Plus or another referendum. Whatever happens, the constitutional consequences are likely to be profound.The power of the courts, the party system, Parliamentary sovereignty, the future of the Union, even the monarchy, might come under scrutiny. Whatever happens will be controversial and further ide the country. But something has to give.So buckle your seatbelts and adopt the brace position.

Were just at the start of the negotiations and at the start of the discussions.And she admitted senior ministers would need to do more No Deal planning when they meet tomorrow.The PM said: We have already stepped up the No Deal preparations, that has been happening in recent days.But Cabinet will be discussing what is the sensible thing for Government to do, which is to make sure that those contingency arrangements are in place.On another day of Brexit high drama:She wants European leaders to agree tweak to the deal in time for a Brussels summit starting on Thursday.That would allow Mrs May to put her deal to MPs as early as next week - butshe fails it could be delayed to the New Year.This morning Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom suggested the PM wanted to give Parliament a say over the backstop.MPs fear the backstop - intended to avoid a hard border in Ireland - could end up locking the UK in the customs union with no way to exit.Mrs Leadsom told the BBC the Commons could get a binding vote on whether to enter the backstop, with an annual review of the situation.But speaking in the European Parliament, Mr Juncker ruled out making substantial changes to the withdrawal agreement, warning the text of the deal is now set in stone.He told MEPs: I will see Mrs May this evening and I have to say the deal we have achieved is the best deal possible, it’s the only deal possible.There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation. But of course there is room,used intelligently, there’s room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without reopening the withdrawal agreement.Everyone has to note that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. The big problem of course is the backstop for Ireland. We have the common determination to do everything to not be in the situation one day to use that backstop, but we have to prepare.The European Parliaments Brexit envoy Guy Verhofstadt added: Whatever the request may be we will never let down our Irish friends. Its out of the question to renegotiate the backstop on Ireland.He suggested the best way to avoid the backstop trap would be for Britain and the EU to agree a closer relationship which keeps trade flowing.And German politician Manfred Weber, a close ally of Mrs Merkel, said: There is no chance to reopen the treaty that is on the table. We don’t play this game - especially in the Irish interest.Frances Europe minister Nathalie Louiseau said: We have to stand ready for a No Deal and were preparing for it.Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he would help Mrs May take any steps needed to avoid a No Deal outcome.Prisons Minister Rory Stewart, one of the PMs most enthusiastic supporters, insisted it was still possible to get a deal which wins over Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson.He told the BBC: I would hope that people like Boris, who have said that their problem is only with the backstop and they could live with the dealthe backstop were changed, hold to their word and we can get them and other colleagues to come on board.The second group we are going to have to reach out to is the DUP and the third group... it would be greatwe can to embrace some of the moderate Labour MPs who believe that we should have a moderate pragmatic Brexit deal.BRITAIN could have to enter the hated Northern Irish backstop after Brexit, evenboth sides dont want to, MPs have warned.The powerful Treasury committee said today that it was feasible that the UK could enter the backstop, even though Theresa May has said that its never intended to actually be used.However, the MPs werent able to model what the economic impact of the PMs deal would be in the short term.And they slammed the Government for failing to talk to businesses about how to prepare for No Deal earlier.MPs said their report shouldnt be used to inform the Brexit vote which was delayed by Theresa May yesterday.But they said Mrs Mays deal was the most optimistic of anything that could happen in Brexit talks - warning that the real outcome could be far worse for Britains economy.Committee chair Nicky Morgan said: The committee is disappointed that the Government has modelled its White Paper, which represents the most optimistic reading of the Political Declaration, rather than a more realistic scenario.The committee is also disappointed that the Treasury has not analysed the backstop and fails to include short-term analysis of any of the scenarios, including impacts on public finances and on regional and sectoral job losses or gains.Britain will fall into the backstopwe cant agree a trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period.The back-up plan, which is hated by MPs across the house, would see Britain go into a customs union with the EU until a deal is reached.But secret legal advice published last week showed it could be impossible to get out, tying us to the EUs rules forever."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0003670525491.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit cake celebration rollout","story":"Cakes were given to staff in  dferent locations to mark the end of the systems introduction in Northern Ireland.The flagship welfare programme will be in every job centre in the UK by the end of the month, for anyone making a new claim.Others on benefits will be rolled over to the new system in the coming months and years.Now Stormonts Department for Communities has come under fire for celebrating it, Irish News reported.SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon described the move as tasteless and insensitive.The North Belfast MLA said: To brand cakes with the Universal Credit logo is tasteless and insensitive.

A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though. The political agenda of the BBC demands it.Who said the following last week: “Oh my God, there’s a cockroach having dinner on my butthole.”A John Barrowman doing the Rotten Retrieval trial on I’m a Celebrity B Tyson Fury during his Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan Sent in by Connor David.

The Labour leader insisted he would wait until the appropriate time to unseat the PM despite calls by four party leaders. The leaders of the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens all demanded he lodge a challenge to Mrs May. But he said it was better to wait until after she finally holds a vote on her Brexit deal - which could be late January. The issue prompted a row within Labour, with more than  MPs urging Mr Corbyn to force out the government now. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also warned Theresa May was trying to run down the clock before Brexit Day on March  and Parliament cannot allow her to get away with that. She said: I want to see a confidence motion that preferably brings this sorry excuse for a government down.  Mr Corbyn, however, said: We have no confidence in this Government. We need to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time to have a motion of no confidence in order to get rid of this Government. Labour argue there is no point forcing a no confidence vote until it can be won. Currently the DUP - whose  MPs prop up the Tory government - are not thought to be willing to back a no confidence vote in parliament. But Labour hope they might do so after Mrs May finally holds a vote on her Brexit deal and it fails in January.  The Labour leader scrapped a meeting with Scottish National Party Westminster chief Ian Blackford last night over the SNP’s “game-playing” over a no-confidence vote. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell insisted Labour will review every day whether to try and oust Theresa May. Pledging to keep plotting how best to remove Mrs May, Shadow Chancellor Mr McDonnell said: “We will judge it as we go on, it will be a fine judgement each day.” He added: “We will put one down when we can win it .. we are judging it literally day by day.” Meanwhile a shadow Brexit minister was forced to backtrack after suggesting the vote would happen by Christmas. Jenny Chapman told LBC: Its gonna happen. Its on its way. I think the vote of confidence will probably come before Santa doesI can put it that way. But after Labour sources insisted the policy had not changed, she hastily backtracked: Might have got a bit carried away trying to make a joke about Christmas! Labour is prepared to bring a no confidence vote and will do so at the best opportunity to topple this rotten Government. There is a clear process for holding a no confidence vote in Parliament.  If more than half of MPs vote no confidence in the government, it has  days to restore order - or there is an automatic general election. Anyone can submit a no confidence motion - but the convention is it is only found debating timelaid by Mr Corbyn. Contrary to suggestions, he can force as many no confidence votes as he wants. But Parliamentary experts argue this would stretch the convention that they are only used when really necessary. Mr McDonnell also accused the SNP of trying to dodge a general election because it would lose seats to Labour.  The SNP wants a second Brexit referendum - and unionists fear thatthe SNP is successful in demanding another EU vote, it will inevitably lead to a fresh referendum on Scottish independence. “All the SNP wants is to avoid a general election. Thenthey pressurise for another referendum on whatever, then they destablise the country to get a referendum in their own country, in Scotland - that’s what this is all about,” he said. “Their tactic is obvious, isn’t it  To press for a vote of no confidence that would potentially lose, that would mean therefore we can’t get a general election. “They are terried of a general election. I was up in Scotland this weekend - they are sitting on a large number of marginal seats at the moment, and we will take them. “Thenthey can’t get a general election they will press for a ‘people’s vote’ and, I think, opportunistically, that then opens an element of destability in Scotland because they will then press for a second referendum. “It’s an obvious strategy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa told eu leaders plan","story":"NewsTheresa May told EU leaders about plan to delay Brexit vote before her own cabinetIts claimed the Prime Minister spoke on the phone to EU chiefs  hours before she told ministers of the plan to pull the meaningful voteShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC News \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May told EU officials she was planning to delay the meaningful vote on Brexit  hours before she told her own Cabinet, it has been claimed.

The Prime Minister had just arrived in Berlin for a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to discuss the Northern Ireland backstop. But on her arrival, aides struggled to open the back door of her limousine, lacking a unilateral mechanism to exit from the vehicle. But the situation turned out to be temporary, and after about  seconds she managed to escape. The Prime Minister finally emerged to shake hands with Mrs Merkel.  Shes due to travel later in the day to Brussels for talks with Mr Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk. The Prime Minister has embarked on a whirlwind tour of European capitals to seek reassurances to get her deal through Parliament, after cancelling a vote scheduled for Tuesday which she accepted she would lose heavily. But she was dealt a blow as European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker declared there was no room whatsoever for renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement reached last month.  Mr Juncker told MEPs the agreement was the best deal possible and the only deal possible. But he offered a glimmer of hope to Mrs May by saying there was room to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement. The delay to the so-called meaningful vote by MPs means that ratication may not be possible until as late as  weeks before the scheduled date of Brexit on March . But Mrs Mays spokesman insisted she continues to believe that necessary preparations can be completed within that time. The Prime Minister held talks over breakfast with her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte in The Hague, which Downing Street described as constructive.  Mrs May told the Dutch PM that additional assurances would be needed on the backstop arrangement to keep the Irish border open after Brexitthe deal was to get through Parliament. The leaders agreed that the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary, the Prime Minister set out the concerns held by many about it in the UK, said her spokesman. She discussed the need for additional assurances on this point in order for the deal with the EU to pass the House of Commons. The Prime Minister and Prime Minister Rutte agreed to work together to find a way through.

Suspending today’s showdown on her Brexit plan is a cowardly act and a futile one by weak and wobbly Theresa May. Hers is a humiliation that proves once and for all that, though she pretends to act in the national interest, our country comes a sad third behind herself and her awful party. The national good is all but forgotten in the PM’s need to save her own skin and her desire to preserve the modern Tories – that splintering coalition of venal interests that caused this mess and keeps on making it worse. But though May might run, she cannot hide. The leaders of the EU’s  countries know she will fail to secure substantial concessions. All those MPs ranged against her know it, too. Everyone gets it but her. The PM also cannot say when she will let our sovereign Parliament finally pass its verdict on her unrecoverable “deal”. She is fighting to survive, day by day.

But this lame duck PM, this rudderless Government, this deadlocked Parliament and this embarrassing stalemate cannot go on. Our proud nation deserves better.

The way Britain is run is not working: Crossrail and Interserve are just the latest examples. With austerity squeezing everything from schools to police, “wealth-fare” payouts for big private firms is a waste of precious money. Financial discipline must be imposed.

Mr Skinner, MP for Bolsover for  years, admitted using the unparliamentary language towards Stewart McDonald, the SNP MP for Glasgow South. Mr McDonald complained to Speaker John Bercow, after Mr Skinner admitted to journalists that he had wanted to put the SNP in their place after Jeremy Corbyn was heckled during todays Brexit debate. The -year-old, known as the Beast of Bolsover for his uncompromising style, mouthed the insult at Glasgow South MP Stewart McDonald during the debate. Mr Skinner, speaking afterwards, said: He attacks Jeremy Corbyn every time he stands up and Ive told him before he is part of the opposition and he should concentrate on attacking the real enemy. I just put them in their place. Mr McDonald branded the Labour veteran a thug after the incident.  He tweeted: A new parliamentary habit seems to be forming, whereby any time an SNP MP sat behind Dennis Skinner verbalises any frustration about what Jeremy Corbyn says, he angrily turns round to tell us off. He has just turned round and called me a piece of shit. He has become a thug. The SNP MP escalated the matter further by raising a point of order with Speaker John Bercow in the Commons. Mr McDonald said: During proceedings earlier the Leader of the Opposition was opening his emergency debate when he had taken an intervention from a member of the Democratic Unionist Party, during the response from the Leader of the Opposition I said to my colleaguethat I wished the Leader of the Opposition would answer a question.  It then promotedto turn around to me and call me a piece of shit, Mr Speaker he then went on to defend that, telling a journalist that he was just putting me in my place. As you know Mr Speaker Ive no desire to raise this formally with you, I had hoped to deal with it informally as you suggested Mr Speaker, but given he shows no sign of having any regret about it can you just reaffirm that its wrong and can you reaffirm that members on all sides should be able to go about this place without being on the tail end of that kind of abuse.

The world in  would once have been imagined with cities in the sky, flying cars and commuter jet-packs. And while our reality is not quite as science fiction as past predictions, it is a pretty clever one. Over the past  years, innovation and invention has quietly shaped how we live and work – with the continuing evolution of smart home connected appliances, lighting and heating systems, and even smart meters. Smart meters are not only an easy tool to track energy use in the home, but the smart meter rollout will support the country in adapting to new, greener ways of generating energy, such as wind or solar power.  Smart meters will also help to inform the smart grid about real time energy usage and will facilitate a sht towards a cleaner, flexible system for a more energy efficient future. More efficient energy use is not the only smart development we can look forward to within our homes. The majority of households in the UK have access to the internet and this is paving the way to a smarter, more connected way of le. What impact has digital tech already had on our homes   In the last four years there has been a surge in smart TV purchases, with almost half of the UK’s population now owning one – allowing us to watch what we want, when we want. But it’s not just entertainment that has been impacted by digital tech – you can get connected devices to help you do all sorts of tasks in the home. We have automated vacuum cleaners, remote video security cameras, robotic lawnmowers, voice-activated lighting systems, app controlled heating systems and smart meters, which show exactly how much energy you are using in pounds and pence, via an in-home display.  All of these are relatively recent innovations that eventhey had been showcased  years ago, would have seemed more science fiction than science fact. “In the past few years, we’ve seen more progress in some areas than in previous decades combined,” explains Alice Bonasio, consultant and Editor-in-Chief of Techtrends.tech. “Experts in fields such as immersive tech, articial intelligence and robotics are constantly having to revise their predictions about when things will cross that threshold between conceptual and actionable. “The ones who prepare for it and embrace the change have a huge opportunity here.” How are digital systems being used by the healthcare industry - and what are the plans for the future   Not only will smart meters contribute to a greener, more cost- effective home set-up, some initial studies have suggested that by sharing energy use data, smart meters could help with in-home care of the vulnerable and elderly by non-invasive monitoring. This could be especially beneficial in flagging unusual behaviour patterns with older people who live alone. Here in the UK, evolutions in medical technology are being billed as the latest way digital systems can be deployed to improve not just the health of an ageing population, but also make access to health care easier. Trials for GP video appointments are already underway in some areas of London.

Lucy Wallis, , was beaten, strangled, bitten and emotionally manipulated by Luke Smallwood. In a campaign of terror that started months into the relationship, Smallwood controlled all her finances paying her an allowance in p pieces.Lucy, an opticians assistant from Swadlincote in Derbyshire, has spoken out in the hope others while learn from her experience.She revealed how on two separate occasions, she was hung from a third floor balcony by her legs. Last Christmas Day, Smallwood strangled her.  Smallwood, , was handed a two-and-a-half year sentence at Derby Crown Court in November. He had pleaded guilty to controlling and coercive behaviour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault. Lucy is now speaking out for the first time. Lucy said: “Luke and I met through a mutual friend, it was my first serious relationship, and it was puppy love. “He seemed like a really nice guy, he paid attention to me, and acted like he really cared. “He was lovely to my mum and he was there for me to start with, he moved in soon after meeting me. “But soon after our relationship started he started pinching me, and digging his nails into my thighs. “He would do this on random occasions, and said he enjoyed causing me pain. He called it ‘soft tissue manipulation’.   “I didn’t know what to think at first, I just thought maybe it was something he liked, but I didn’t expect it to go any further than that. “Once you get attached, it becomes easier to let things like that go. “Watch out the little things, that’s always where it starts. “What started with pinching, became emotional and physical torture.” Lucy said because she loved Smallwood, who she met in June , she found it hard to acknowledge what was happening as his attacks gradually got more severe. Within a short space of time he began to punch her in the face, headbutt and bite her, and on two separate occasions hung her off of a third floor balcony, head first, holding her legs. On Christmas day , Smallwood strangled her until she couldn’t breathe, then released his grip, only to tighten it again once she had caught her breath.   He would also control her money, giving her an allowance of pound a week in only two pence pieces while banning her from seeing her friends and family. Lucy said: “The first time when during an argument he punched me in the face, I was shocked. “After the abuse, he would always try and apologise it away, but the punching never stopped, it just kept getting worse. “One night during a usual argument that we would have, he stood up and headbutted me. “I had to tell people that we were just play fighting and I accidentally clashed heads with him. “Another time when I put the heating on he woke up and beat me up for making him too hot. “I was paranoid about losing my job because he would tell me I couldn’t leave the house.   She continued: “Eventually he would let me leave, but confiscate my phone from me for the day. “He used to tell me my family and friends didn’t love me, and stopped me from contacting them. “He was brutal, he didn’t care about the damage he was doing. “He would hold me over the balcony and tell me he could drop mehe wanted too. “It was scary because even though it was a threat, he could have slipped, and he could have accidentally dropped me at any moment. “It was a game to him.” Survivor Lucy made the decision to go to the police after colleagues at work noticed she was covered in bruises. But she admits the after effects of the abuse still haunt her now, despite her strong nature.   Lucy now wants to share her story, with the hope that it will find any current victims of domestic abuse and show them getting out is possible. Lucy said: “I used to go out and do the usual twenty something activities. I was social and loved to have a laugh with my friends. “But when I was with Luke I wasn’t the same Lucy. “I even stopped posting anything on social media. “My friends told me I was a completely dferent person. “I didn’t recognise myself anymore, he drained the le out of me and left me losing my grip on reality. “The day I spoke to my manager at work, I went home and told Luke he didn’t have any control over me anymore. “A light just came on, I could see who he was.   She added: “It sounds weird, but I was still heartbroken, because somehow I still loved him. “All he cared about was controlling me, and abusing me with that control. “The most depressing part for me, is that I struggle to trust anyone now. “I wish I had listened to my friends, they kept telling me to leave, but I always found a reason to stay. “He used to tell me I made him the way he was, which I started to believe. “I just want other victims to know they’re not alone, the police were really sensitive and they were there for me from start to finish. “Be objective, and make the right decision. “Don’t ever let them manipulate you into thinking you deserve what is happening to you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"baby faced yobs aged 13","story":"NewsBaby-faced yobs, aged  to , named and shamed after terrorising townJayden Burdern, aged , Riley Gaffney, aged , and -year-old Reigan Gaffney, of Crewe, wreaked havoc in Congleton, CheshireShareByHayley ParkerToby Meyjes:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsJayden Burdern, , has been handed two-year criminal behaviour order\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThree baby-faced thugs who terrorised a town have been named and shamed by police.

In the case of a young person, taking a criminal case is always a last resort and our officers both within Cheshire Constabulary and Cheshire East Council have spent a considerable amount of time over several years to support everyone involved. “However, there has to be a point at which we say, enough is enough, our residents have the right to live in peace and without fear and we must protect them from iniduals who don’t respect this.

A study exploring how family food trends have changed over the decades found our palettes still crave many of the same flavours we enjoyed decades ago. Other family meals which have stood the test of time include fish and chips, shepherd’s pie and jacket potato. And modern parents reckon a third of the meals they feed their kids are the same or similar to the ones their parents gave them when they were children. Food historian Monica Askay, acting as spokesperson for cooking appliance brand, Belling, which commissioned the study, said: “Food is and has always been subject to fashion. Our food choices are influenced by so many things including social factors, the availability of ingredients, foreign travel, immigration, celebrity chefs, advances in technology, changing health advice, and food scares.  “Food of the s was still much influenced by the -year period of rationing during and following WW. “The preferred style of eating was very much ‘meat and two veg’ - traditional British dishes. “Over the decades our tastes have become much more cosmopolitan, and we have also reduced our meat consumption. “The research shows that despite the large range of dishes and available ingredients we do tend to stick to a fairly small number of favourite dishes, and that many of these have remained preferred throughout the decades.” The study also found our favourite modern family meal is Spaghetti Bolognese, rising from relative obscurity in the s to become a family staple. Spag bol – which is currently the most popular choice with families in  – couldn’t crack the top  meals back in the s, according to the survey.  Though by the s the meal had become the fth most popular family dinnertime dish. Pizza has also experienced a meteoric rise over the last  years. While rarely invited to the dinner table in the s, pizza became the tenth most popular family meal of choice in the s, and became the top dinner staple throughout the s, according to the survey. Monica explained the appeal of Italian foods: “The rise in popularity of Italian dishes is interesting and quite complicated as it is due to a number of factors. Over the years, there has been migration to the UK from Italy and this led to the many influences on our food. This has included ice cream and ice cream parlours, s coffee bars and the opening of restaurants like Spaghetti House and trattorias. “This, alongside rising numbers of British people holidaying abroad and dietary advice stating a third of your meal should be carbohydrate and citing pasta as a great source of this added to its popularity. “In later years, the increased availability of pasta in shops and supermarkets, rise of Italian ready meals, and popularity of celebrity chefs who are passionate about the cuisine have helped cement Italian meals as some of the nation’s favourites.  Pizza has many American influences and was helped to fame by the opening of chain pizza restaurants across the UK.” The Sunday roast, which was consistently the most popular family meal throughout the s and s, has steadily been replaced by other alternatives since the s, and now sits in sixth place in the rankings. Seventy five per cent of modern parents still believe it is important for their family to eat dinner together each evening, and the average family will manage to get together for a meal four times a week. Fty five per cent of those surveyed consider family mealtimes the highlight of their day. And three in  think their kids prefer classic meals which have stood the test of time over more modern, trendier cuisine. Two thirds of parents think there is more pressure on them to feed their kids healthy, balanced meals than there was on their own parents decades ago. Though almost a third of parents believe their kids are less interested in eating healthy food than they were when they were children themselves, according to the OnePoll study.  A spokesperson for -year-old cooking appliance maker, Belling, said: “We commissioned this research to find out how much things like trends and new diets had impacted on family favourite foods. “But whilst fashion, music and culture has shted in the last  years, we still crave the tastes of our childhoods. “Belling has been at the heart of the family home for over  years, so whilst we know that there are some consistent family favourites which have really stood the test of time, it has been interesting to see dishes which we now consider synonymous with family mealtimes rising from relative obscurity, like everyone’s favourite Spag Bol, to take the top spot in our chart.” THE NATION’S FAVOURITE FAMILY MEALS .

She paired her outfit with simple jewellery and some burgundy nails - which goes against one of the Queens major fashion rules, as she reportedly considers coloured nail nish to be vulgar.

Established in  by Prince Charles, Turquoise Mountain is a charity which aims to preserve and regenerate historic areas and communities in order to create new jobs, skills and a renewed sense of pride.

Can you please PM and let me know what time you ordered, which meal you ordered and your best contact phone number for follow up.” Another Facebook user agreed with James Phan replying: “Have you seen a chicken head  “A chicken brain is the size of a Malteser.

The -year-old continues to stun people with her eerily accurate predictions despite her death from breast cancer more than two decades ago. The Bulgarian prophetess is said to have foreseen Brexit, the Twin Tower attacks and the rise of ISIS among other historical events. It was after an apparent freak accident aged  which left her blind, that she began to have visions which led her to predict events that came true with extreme accuracy. People would flock to her humble home in the mountains to be healed and told of their future.   In her final days, those who visited her say frail Baba would sit in the middle of her living room beside a table of gts from visitors. When she wasnt giving readings and knitting, she reportedly appeared exhausted and pale and at times she could barely speak. She would also apparently ask guests to bring sugar cubes with them and she would hold them in her hands asthey were a crystal before giving a reading. And in her last interview before she died, Baba apparently gave the world a poignant message and said: Don’t hate each other because you are all my children!” Meanwhile, as we previously reported, Babas chilling prediction about the date the world will end has been revealed. She said it will happen in .   Although she did not detail why or how this would happen, she is said to have an  per cent success rate with her predictions. She also appears to have foretold some le-changing occurrences for the next  months, including an economic collapse in Europe and an assassination attempt on Vladmir Putin. She reportedly believed the threat to Putin will come from inside his own security team - but did not specy whether the head of state will die in the attack. She thinks a mega-tsunami, similar to the  disaster, will strike in Asia while a meteorite will land in Russia. Not only that, but Donald Trump will fall ill with a mystery illness, leaving him deaf and suffering from brain trauma. Baba Vanga began to realise she had a gt after losing her sight aged  when she was apparently lted into the air during a storm and flung into a field.   When she tried to open her eyes they were covered in dirt and dust and she was left in agony. Despite three operations, nothing could be done to save her vision. She later cheated death aged  after suffering from pleurisy - which affects breathing and the lungs - with doctors believing she would die. She was also born prematurely and suffered health complications, grew up in poverty, had to look after her siblings following the death of her mother and stepmother, and saw her father arrested after being accused of pro-Bulgarian activity. She began to experience unusual things in her dreams, hear voices, talk to the dead and plants, as well as having visions which led her to predict events that came true with extreme accuracy. In  she guessed that America will be hit by a terror attack by two steel birds   She said: Horror, horror! The American brothers will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing. Baba reportedly prophesised a  invasion of Europe by Islamist extremists, a conflict she predicted would begin with the Arab Spring in . It also emerged that she predicted that Putin and Russia will dominate the world In , during a meeting with writer Valentin Sidorov, Vanga said: “All will thaw, asice, only one remain untouched - Vladimir’s glory, glory of Russia. Too much it is brought in a victim. Nobody can stop Russia. All will be removed by her from the way and not only will be kept, but also becomes the lord of the world.” The future predictions of the blind mystic Ice caps melt From  to  the polar ice caps will melt, causing ocean levels to rise. Meanwhile, Muslims rule Europe and the world economy is thriving.  Cloning cures most diseases The rise of cloning allows doctors to cure any disease as the body is simply and easily replaced. The US will launch an attack on Muslim Rome using a climate-based ‘instant freezing’ weapon.

The end of the Earth From  a series of natural and man-made disasters render our home planet uninhabitable. Humanity escapes to another solar system, but resources are scarce and wars are waged as a result. Going backwards -  to  Civilization has been destroyed and people live like beasts until a new religion rises to lead us out of the darkness.  Immortal alien hybrids From  to  the concepts of evil and hatred have been eliminated, humans are immortal and have assimilated with aliens. The  billion people scattered throughout the universe can talk to God. The end of all things In  the world will end. Did Baba Vanga predict these events  The Kursk nuclear submarine disaster In  the blind prophetess predicted that in August of  “Kursk will be covered with water and the whole world will weep over it. Kursk was a Russian sub that sank in the Barents Sea on August , , killing all aboard.    In  Baba Vanga said: “Horror, horror! The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing. On September , , planes hijacked by Islamic extremists hit the World Trade Center in New York, killing thousands of people. World War III Baba warned that assassination attempts on four heads of states in  would become one of the causes for the start of WWIII. Some dismissed this prediction as incorrect as the heads of state were believed to potentially refer to Obama, Sarkozsky, Netanyahu, Vladimir Putin and Gordon Brown. However, observers note that Hamas leader Mahmuacuted al-Mabhouh was assassinated in Dubai on January ,  and Polish leader Lech Kaczynski was found dead in suspicious circumstances on April , . Others point out that Libyas Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was killed on October ,  and Saddam Hussein died a few years earlier on December , . All were linked to the Arab Spring which Baba said would set events in motion which would bring about the next global conflict.  Syria Before she died, the clairvoyant made a chilling prophecy about the rise of nuclear weapons. Baba reportedly prophesised a  invasion of Europe by Muslim extremists, a conflict she predicted would begin with the Arab Spring in . She also allegedly forewarned of a showdown in Syria where Muslims would use chemical warfare against Europeans. The prediction is eerily similar to the Sarin gas attack thought to have been conducted on the orders of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Brexit Theorists believe she foretold Brexit - even going so far as to say that Europe as we know it will “cease to exist” by the end of . North Korea and Donald Trump Baba also appeared to predict that the th President of the United States - Donald Trump - would be faced with a crisis which would bring the country down. Her chilling prediction states: “Everyone will put their hopes in him to end it, but the opposite will happen he will bring the country down and conflicts between north and south states will escalate.” Some speculate the references to north and south could mean North and South Korea.

Sanaztt, who has more than , followers, also regularly posts pictures of her plumped up pout and ever changing hair colour.   In her most recent photos, she can be seen sporting blonde and pink dreadlocks right down to her waist. Meanwhile, Sahar also appears to have dramatically changed her appearance again. In her latest photographs, shes ditched her long brunette locks for bright green, orange and white wigs. She has also replaced foundation with white face paint. After going viral, Sahar reportedly claimed she had  surgeries and lost  kilos to get her distinctive look and mimic her idol.   But she attracted lots of criticism with many people comparing her looks to Tim Burtons the Corpse Bride and many doubtingher looks were real, or just the result of digital trickery. After causing a flurry of internet speculation Sahar appeared to confirm she had had cosmetic surgery but insisted she never wanted to look like A-lister Jolie. She told Russian website Sputnik News although she had some plastic surgeries, including rhinoplasty, liposuction and cosmetic procedures to give her fuller lips, her spooky looks were mostly down to make-up prosthetics and photoshop.   She also reportedly confirmed the suspicions of eagle-eyed social media users who claimed the photos were definitely digitally altered. She said: No. It is Photoshop and makeup. Every time I publish a photo I make my face more fun. It is my way of self-expression, a kind of art. My followers know that this is not my real face. I had no interest at all to be like Angelina Jolie, and I did not want to look like the character from Corpse Bride. I understand that I do have some similarities with them, but I am my own muse and I did not want to look like anyone. That was not my aim.

The SVR has historically been extremely careful in how it manages the flow of information available to the public, allowing rumours of its deadly reputation to thrive. The agency works along side and often together with the GRU, the Russian intelligence agency suspected of orchestrating the Skripal poisoning.

Alan Gilzean had a brilliant hat-trick, his deft touches were a joy to watch.“The cross swung over from Gordon Smith into Cologne’s box was met by Gilzean, and his head launched a guided missile, the ball bulged and strained the goal net.“The crescendo from Dens was fuelled by an emotional cocktail of euphoria and incredulity, a local wag told me the noise was heard in Cologne. This was the European Cup – how was this possible  The final score of Dundee  Cologne .”The tournament progressed, as did Rob: “Dundee FC and the European campaign advanced.“Sporting Lisbon came to Dens, as did Anderlecht, and Alan Gilzean had notched eight goals so far in this tournament between home and away games. And now the European Cup semi-finals, the first game would be in Italy against AC Milan, and The Courier the morning after the game described it as ugly and rough.“In thegame at Dens, Alan Gilzean was sent off after eventually retaliating against the brutal attacks on him from Milan players.“It was an exit of frustration for Dundee FC from the European Cup and it stripped naivety from all Dundee football fans in the belief that this sport should be played in the spirit of fair play by both teams, and that referee decisions would be unbiased and judicious.”Rob concluded: Some years ago, I would frequent a watering hole called The Saracens Head, and among the patrons were a couple of lads who hailed from north London.“They were Spurs fans.

We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":null,"title":"long awaited us takeover of dundee united moves closer","story":"Rumours the long-awaited Dundee United takeover is nearing completion are growing.So far there has been no statement from either the Tangerines nor the prospective new owners – believed to be American-based businessmen – but it has been suggested a deal to buy the shareholding of chairman Mike Martin has been agreed.Martin controls just over % of the stock and that means new owners would also need at least some of the shares of his fellow director Jim Fyffe who has around %.Their shareholdings were confirmed in a list lodged at Companies House in Edinburgh recently.There had been speculation new owners would be confirmed last week and although that didn’t happen, it does now seem change at the top could be on the way.It’s understood United are set clary whether or not the deal is going ahead at some point in the next few days.Talks with the Americans have been ongoing since last year and originally a deal was expected to be done during the summer.When that didn’t happen, former chairman Stephen Thompson sold his majority stake to Martin and Fyffe in a deal that also involved investment from two other United-minded parties who preferred to remain anonymous.All along, though, Martin has insisted the discussions with the Americans have been progressing, albeit at a slower pace.Indications are they’re now complete and it is simply a matter of satisfying legal requirements before fans find out who will be leading their club for the foreseeable future."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/IMG_2467.jpg ","title":"sponsored everyones talking about dundee newest cook school","story":"People are talking, their social media following is growing and the doors will soon be open.

It’s up to Frank Lampard and the gaffer here.“I’m really enjoying my time here. It was meant to be six months.“The left-back therehas picked up an injury, which changes things a bit but we’ll see what happens.”During Lowe’s time with Aberdeen, Lampard has been keeping a close eye on the player’s performances for the Reds.He added: “Frank Lampard rang me after the League Cup final and thought I did well.“He said the boys were unlucky, which we were because the performance was there, we just didn’t get the result.“Him or Jody Morriscontact me after games and speak about what I did well and what I need to improve on.“It’s similar to the gaffer here. He’s the first to come to me and say ‘you did that well, but you didn’t do this well’.“Then we go into training and work on it straight away because I need to improve my game while I’m here.”Tonight Aberdeen look to move back into the Premiership’s top six following Saturday’s - defeat to St Johnstone by leapfrogging Livingston with a win against the Lions at Pittodrie.It’s the fourth of nine games in a hectic December for the Dons. With five home games before the Premiership’s winter break in January, Lowe wants to take advantage and gather plenty of points to move up the table.“It’s a great opportunity for us, especially with a lot of games at home,” he said.“We need to take advantage of these home games. We take it game by game and move on from Saturday quickly and try to win this game.“It’s been really annoying, losing on Saturday, because we have been trying to find that consistency of winning games. But we can’t seem to get a run going. Sooner rather than later, hopefully we can get a run of games going.“On Saturday it was more the performance that was the problem in the second half we stopped believing once the two goals went in.“They were cheap goals to lose and we didn’t seem to have that belief.“But we need to find it and we’ve got it in us because we have done well against Celtic and Rangers, so it’s frustrating.“It does feel like one step forward and then one step back but the only good thing about it is that we’ve got a lot of games coming up and hopefully we can turn it round quickly.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe success of independent retailers depends on imagination and initiative, and Lochgilphead shops will be showing plenty of that # and festive spirit # in the weeks leading up to Christmas.Lochgilphead is, arguably, seeing a mini-revival, with new businesses outnumbering closures in recent times.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all in reaching this point and look forward to being a part of one of Scotland#s most innovative water sport developments.#The seasports initiative has boosted membership at Campbeltown Sailing Club from

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

I like having hair that looks like a volcano is erupting.However, despite its distinctive appeal, it has been suggested that the pale skin tone which often accompanies red hair may make people more susceptible to certain types of skin cancer.Redheads may also grow weary of peoples expectations that they have a fiery temperament, a myth based on folklore from many countries.It is thought that red hair appeared between , to , years ago, and that Neanderthals also had the MCR gene which makes it possible.Scientists have also suggested that woolly mammoths, which roamed the earth during the last ice age, were covered in ruddy red fur. based on tufts still found on frozen carcasses from Siberia.The Researchers looked at DNA from almost , people who had taken part in the UK Biobank study.The study focused on people of European descent because they have greater iation in hair colour.Comparing redheads to people with brown or black hair, they identied eight previously unknown genetic dferences that are associated with red hair.The team also looked at the s of the genes they identied and found that some of them work by controlling when MCR is switched on or off.In addition to the redhead genes, the researchers uncovered dferences in almost  genes associated with blondes and brunettes.Scientists say there is a gradient of colour from black, through dark brown to light brown and blonde, which is caused by increasing number of genetic dferences in these  genes.The researchers were surprised to find that many of these  genetic dferences were associated with hair texture rather than pigmentation.Others are involved in determining how the hair grows ndash such as whether curly or straight.Redhead Emma Kelly, who successfully campaigned to have Apple create a ginger-haired emoji, said the study was a bost to ginger pride.The businesswoman, who runs the Ginger Parrot lestyle website for redheads,said: \"Itrsquos absolutely fascinating that more and more information is coming out about how natural red hair occurs - who knew us redheads were so complicated \"Red hair is an area of genetics that is still so little known, so itrsquos great that more research is being dedicated to know how such a rare genetic gt occurs.\"Irsquom extremely proud of my red hair and learning more about how rare it is genetically just makes me realise how special it is. I hope that this new research will continue to empower all redheads of all ages to feel distinct ginger pride.\"Redhead Alex McLeishThe study, published in Nature Communications, was funded by the Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.Professor Ian Jackson, of the Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit at the University of Edinburgh, said: ldquoWe were able to use the power of UK Biobank, a huge and unique genetic study of half a million people in Britain, which allowed us to find these effects.Professor Albert Tenesa, of the University of Edinburghrsquos Roslin Institute, added: ldquoWe are very pleased that this work has unravelled most of the genetic iation contributing to dferences in hair colour among people.Melanie Welham, Executive Chair of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, said that the breakthrough the study had been achieved through close collaboration between scientists.She said : ldquoOnce again collaborative research is helping to provide answers to some of lersquos important questions.\"BBSRC is pleased to have helped support the largest genetic study of human hair colour.

In future, though, I will not be quite so hasty to pass judgement.My first ndash and hopefully last ndash experience of refereeing a match came when I went to watch my eldest son play for his school team. As the game was about to kick-off it emerged no whistler had turned up. So I got tapped on the shoulder by one of the coaches and asked to step in to the breach.Now, it was hardly the second leg of the Copa Liberatadores final between Boca Juniors and River Plate in the Bernabeu. It was a seven-a-side game between a bunch a  and -year-old boys on one third of an articial pitch in the suburbs of Glasgow. Nevertheless, it gave an eye-opening insight into the lot of the man-in-black.Who knew, for example, that determining which player touched the ball last in a   challenge and which team should subsequently be awarded a throw-in could be dficult  Having a linesman would have helped. But it was startling how something so seemingly straightforward could be so challenging.The reaction to many of my calls ndash indignation, outrage, tears, recrimination, disbelief ndash was also unexpected.Anyone who says that kids arenrsquot influenced by how high-profile professional players behave on television is, as Steve Clarke might well say, talking out of their backside.One particular objectionable urchin, who must have stood all of three feet tall in his studs, spent a couple of minutes after the game offering a less than complimentary appraisal of my performance. Apparently, for example, shouting isnrsquot allowed in boysrsquo football and is punishable by a free-kick. You learn something new every day.As for the spectators! Their conduct of the smattering of onlookers in what was effectively a kickabout left much to be desired. One especially joyless parent on the sidelines took time to inform me ldquothat was a blue ball after one of my dubious calls. Had he sensed my deep-rooted anti-blue agenda Then there was my positioning. I made Willie Young look like Kylian Mbappe as a I lumbered about the pitch trying to keep up with the action. But I lost count of the occasions I found myself either in the way of play or in a hopeless vantage point.How do referees possibly work out in the blink of an eyea player who was in an offside position had been interfering with play after a goal is scored by a team mate  How do they cope with making such a call in front of tens of thousands of people  The mind truly boggled.Several Stella after the ordeal, I concluded that referees are selfless not clueless iniduals, have a nigh on impossible task and deserve our sympathy and support not abuse and opprobrium.At the very least, they need VAR. The system, as we saw at Russia , isnrsquot perfect, but in an age when every passage of play is filmed from half a dozen dferent angles and incidents dissected the instant they happen, it would help quell a growing disaffection with match officials and make their lives easier."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-stock-exchange-could-be-up-and-running-within-months","story":"The company behind the plans, Bourse Scot Ltd, has agreed a partnership with established stock market operator Euronext, and claims the exchange could launch in the second quarter of .The initiative, known as Project Heather, will form the first Scottish stock exchange since the s, with a head office in Edinburgh and further offices planned for Glasgow and Aberdeen.Project leader Tomaacutes Carruthers, an experienced broker and entrepreneur, said: ldquoStock exchanges play a vital role in bringing together investors and businesses seeking investment.ldquoIn the s there were five such exchanges across Scotland, enabling Scottish investors to directly fund business opportunities which, in turn, supported economic growth.ldquoFty years on and the economic landscape in Scotland is very dferent.

Similarly the ldquoPeoplersquos Vote, having in itself no authority, is devised to influence the Westminster Parliament, which its supporters hope will persuade the Government into authorising a new referendum.In both cases a single driving force was needed to co-ordinate policy. Today Labour is by no means united on our relationship with the EU and it is a Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, who has co-ordinated pro-EU and related groups, as did the European Movement in . Even the funding of these two bodies was similar: in the year following March  the European Movement was able to distribute pound,, much of it from un-named donors, for EEC promotion finance for the Peoplersquos Vote campaign has been raised through crowd-funding.If Ian Blackford is so concerned about the accuracy of interpretation he should examine the backgrounds and interests of its leading proponents. ldquoPeople they undoubtedly are, but not in the sense that we are intended to understand by a ldquoPeoplersquos Vote. It would be at least more honest,not more accurate, to refer to a second referendum.Mary Rolls, Castlegate, Jedburgh.GIVEN the shambles that the Government is making of \"respecting the will of the British people\" and that it is very clear that there is no majority in Parliament for any decisive action, the question must be ed to the electorate for a final decision.Irsquove heard a lot of muddled thinking being espoused about how you achieve this. Itrsquos very simple, rerun the Brexit question, Do you want the UK to leave the EU  Yes No, and add a supplementary question, In the event of a Yes vote, do you want Mrs Mays Plan No Deal.That would resolve the issue once and for all and would be the settled will of the British people.Bill Hendry, Blackwood Road, Milngavie.IN times of stress I have a release activity: I ldquocut the Bible ndash that is, I open it with eyes closed and select the left-hand column. Having listened to the Andrew Marr show with more on the Brexit bourach , it seemed more than happenstance that the Bookopened at Jeremiah  and the verse read: \"Is there no longer wisdom  Has counsel perished from the prudent  Has their wisdom decayed Thom Cross, Needle Green, Carluke.FOR those who would wish to contribute Irsquom considering starting a crowd-funding site to fund the purchase an elephant, a howdah, the services of a mahout and a punkah wallah. Itrsquos a damnable shame that David Mundell, who appears to believe and act ashe is the Viceroy of the Raj in Scotland rather than the Peoplersquos representative in Westminster, is forced to act the role without the proper trappings of power. Oh, and we need to get a big hat with a white plume on it.David J Crawford, Whittingehame Court,  Great Western Road, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-mps-must-reject-brexit-deal-and-let-public-have-their-say","story":"Though the decision will not go down well with the kind of hard-line Brexiteer who believes the blind vote cast in  should be binding, news from the past few days alone highlights why the option is at the very least worth exploring. Indeed, while accountancy giants EY and KPMG are the latest in a long line of experts to issue warnings about the potentially dire economic prospects facing both Scotland and the UKan orderly withdrawal cannot be agreed, the Federation of Small Businesses has found that ldquothe uncertainty and confusion associated with Brexit has brought Scottish business confidence to its lowest-ever ebb, with firms - for which read employers - north of the Border ldquoparticularly distressed about the current state of affairs.While that could have serious consequences for the jobs market, fears are growing about the impact Brexit could have on Scotlandrsquos cultural scene, which relies on international funding packages not to mention the free movement of people for its survival. Though Aberdeenshire-based arts director Claudia Zeiske has floated plans for a body that would help Scottish artists maintain ties with Europe following the UKrsquos departure, the organisation would rely on external funding to survive and we all know what happens to funding for the arts in times of economic stre.Asall that wasnrsquot bad enough the pound, which has never recovered from the battering it took in the wake of the Brexit referendum, fell so low after Theresa May yesterday decided to postpone parliamentrsquos vote on her withdrawal plan that it is now essentially on an equal footing to both the dollar and the euro. Not only does that have serious consequences for trade, it makes a mockery of all that Brexit was supposed to achieve and brings cold comfort to anyone hoping to escape the gloom by indulging in a bit of winter sun. Quite where the pound will be when summer comes around is anyonersquos guess.Of course, just because the European court has said we can cancel Brexit does not mean that we will, with the case still to go back to the Court of Session for a final ruling. As the Scottish judges had sought their European colleaguesrsquo opinion in order to help them make their decision that may well turn out to be a formality, but even then cancelling the deal will in no way be a done deal. While the ECJ ruling has made clear that parliament can instruct the Government to halt the Brexit process, arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg noted that the latter is unlikely to accept such instructions without a fight. ldquoThe only way to stay in the European Union is to legislate to do so, to reverse the Withdrawal Act, and that would require the Government to do a complete U-turn, he said soon after the judgment was handed down. And, though hersquoll have sent many hearts a-fluttering by adding that ldquothis government would find it very dficult to remain the governmentit went away from what it said in its manesto and the referendum result, the logical alternative - a change of regime - would not necessarily bring about a dferent result.Indeed, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is apparently itching to form a minority government should MPs vote to reject Mrs Mayrsquos withdrawal agreement, his long-held opposition to the European project would suggest that far from seeking to give up on Brexit he would instead look to make his own mark on it. Given how shambolic his Labour leadership has been, it can hardly be imagined that he will be able to magically deliver something better than the Prime Ministerrsquos wholly unsatisfactory deal - or that Mrs May will be able to negotiate some kind of improvement simply by delaying parliamentrsquos vote.Yet as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pointed out on Twitter, what the ECJ judgment does pave the way for is ldquoan extension of Article  to allow time for another vote, followed by revocation of Article the outcome is Remain. As we now know so much more about the implications of Brexit than we did when the first referendum was held, surely this is not only the most preferable route to go down but the fairest too.Wersquove known for some time that the economic consequences of leaving the EU will be far from favourable and the news on that front only seems to be getting worse. With the popular support for Brexit now being led by none other than Tommy Robinson - a man so extreme in his views that even yesterdayrsquos xenophobe Nigel Farage has distanced himself from him - the whole project has descended into farce. Thanks to the ECJ ruling, at the very least MPs can vote down the withdrawal agreement - in whatever form it may eventually take - safe in the knowledge that no-deal chaos does not have to ensue. It will hardly be an end in itself, but letrsquos hope they do just that."},{"url":null,"title":"westminster-reacts-to-theresa-mays-meaningful-vote-delay","story":"• Westminster holds emergency debate over delay of meaningful vote• Nicola Sturgeon calls on Labour to lodge vote of no confidence in Theresa Mays government"},{"url":null,"title":"council-approves-plans-for-700-build-to-rent-homes-in-glasgow","story":"Residential investor Get Living said its build-to-rent scheme will transform a derelict site behind High Street train station in Glasgow.:Wheatley secures funding for  new homesIt said that Glasgow City Council has approved plans which will enable the investment partnership behind Get Living PLC to invest poundm to build  new build-to-rent homes on the .-acre site.The scheme will feature a new public square,  student studios and around , sq m of space for retail, leisure, food and drink and commercial businesses.There will also be new tree-lined access routes on the site to connect the Merchant City through to the East End via High Street.Rick de Blaby, executive chairman of Get Living, said: ldquoWith a wealth of commercial developments in the city centre and on the waterfront of the river Clyde, it is an exciting time for Glasgow and it is fantastic to be able to say we are now a part of its ongoing revitalisation.:New homes plan for Newton Mearns given green lightldquoWe have listened carefully to the views of local businesses and the people of Glasgow in forming these ambitious plans.Other than a section currently used as a car park the site has lain vacant and derelict for many years.Developers said the Molendinar Burn, the original freshwater source upon which Glasgow was founded, passes under the site while the area was home to the University of Glasgow before it moved to the west end in the th century.Work on the first phase of the development is expected to start in , subject to securing a building warrant."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9075296.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jean-claude-juncker-there-is-no-room-whatsoever-for-brexit-renegotiation","story":"The President of the European CommissionJean-Claude Juncker won applause from MEPs as he said: \"There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation, but of course there is roomused intelligently, there is room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement.\"This will not happen: everyone has to note that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened.\":Brexit live: Westminster fury as Theresa May cancels voteHe confirmed he would meet Mrs May on Tuesday evening but reiterated: \"The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible -

She has told everyone it is her deal or no deal – or even no Brexit. She has sought to rely on the votes of Labour MPs – providing briefings for key Labour MPs ahead of those from her own party. Accordingly the deal has undergone close detailed scrutiny and been found wanting. Some of the legal advice that the Government then chose to ignore has exposed the deal’s real weaknesses – which, crucially, are far more than the Irish Protocol known as the backstop.Of real concern must also be the failure of Theresa May’s government to show that it has made a serious effort to prepare for No Deal. Those two counts – losing a vote over her flagship policy and leaving the country ill-prepared to face an economic risk – are capital offences that would normally warrant removal from office. It should be remembered that in  the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain actually won a vote of confidence following the failure of the Norwegian campaign yet he knew he no longer had moral or political authority and resigned with dignity. Theresa May must also resign to maintain any degree of political respect, andshe does not she should be subject to a vote of confidence within her parliamentary party, for that is the only way to replace her with someone who can get down to the task of preparing the country for leaving without a deal while trying to get the EU to compromise.A vote of no confidence put forward by Labour would most likely fail, as the DUP would not wish to bring down the governing party in favour of Jeremy Corbyn – and recalcitrant Tory MPs would also fall into line rather than be responsible for the fall of the government and the calling of an early general election. So it must be down to backbenchers to submit their letters to trigger the Conservative Party’s own procedures. At that point I would expect the likes of Jeremy Hunt and Savid Javid to tell the Prime Minister it was time to step aside or face humiliation from her own colleagues.There is much talk for May being given one last chance in Brussels this week and thatshe can get a time limit on the Irish Protocol or other such fix that allows the UK to claim a minor victory then her deal could then pass. This would be a foolish and dangerous approach, for even without the backstop the deal is not Brexit. It would still tie the UK into many Single Market rules overseen by the European Courts of Justice and throw away £ billion for nothing in . Countries like South Korea and Canada make no contribution to access the EU’s markets and the House of Lords found there was no obligation to pay the EU £bn.A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure to meet, Simon Boyd, the Scottish CEO of Reid Steel. Simon, who served his apprenticeship in a Clyde shipyard, explained to me how the company he runs, which exports to some  countries around the world, was originally established in France in  – but is now located in Dorset. Yet despite this pedigree and the existence of the so-called Single Market he finds it easier to export steel to Mongolia than he does to France. He gave me two examples of why the first was when his company had a UK Government contract to build storage facilities at Calais, and the second was for a £.M aircraft hangar in Toulouse – but Reid Steel could not do either because it is not a French company. In France only French companies can buy the insurances needed to work in their country. Those insurances also require that all materials have been approved by the French testing authorities, making it more dficult for UK manufactured goods.Far from creating a level playing field like the single market Scotland enjoys across the whole of the United Kingdom, the EU has rigged the game rampant protectionism is the only winner – and this state of affairs is what the Withdrawal Agreement seeks to maintain.Boyd also explained to me how the EU’s Eurocodes system for design unormity ensures each dferent country, and in some cases dferent regions, have their own local ‘annexes’ or conditions. Often they are in native languages and are simply a means to tie up competition in a tangle of prohibitive and costly red tape. Businesses have to purchase Eurocodes from the British Standards Institute, which is a signicant overhead and can be a barrier to entry for many SMEs. To purchase just one part of the Eurocodes for Reid Steel’s type of work costs circa £,, and that is for just one of the  parts of the codes that relate to their industry. For an SME like Reid Steel these overheads are burdensome,not completely unaffordable.As a further example Boyd told me of how Reid Steel designed and helped build  structures in the Caribbean, all designed to British Standards . Every single one stood up to the category five hurricanes last year. Boyd doubted Reid Steel would have been able to win that work using Eurocodes as the use of Eurocodes internationally is rare.The UK needs to be free from the EU’s bureaucratic restraints of the Single Market, Customs Union and the jurisdiction of the ECJcompanies like Reid Steel are to maintain their global reach and grow. The Withdrawal Agreement is a bad deal – with or without the Backstop – and on Tuesday MPs need to take the brave pills and defeat it to ensure a real Brexit can be delivered by setting up the chance for a better deal.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841571.1544428298!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch norway plus is not an option for the uk s brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Amber Rudd and her colleagues are deluding themselves with their Brexit plan B, writes Lesley RiddochScots stand today, surveying the collapse of British governance, like folk on leboats watching the mighty Titanic start to slip beneath the waves.Most of us do not vote Conservative and never will. Most of us voted to Remain in the EU in . And now most of us would opt for independence in the EUa self-harming Brexit goes ahead. And no matter which withdrawal deal is advocated by desperate members of both main political parties south of the Border, each one is more damaging than simply staying in the EU. That includes Amber Rudd’s crazy, last gasp advocacy of “Norway-plus” as a Brexit option,or really when Theresa May’s dead duck is finally allowed to waddle off the stage. Of course, on the face of it, Norway-plus looks inviting. The UK was one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Associationin . Britain left to join the EEC in , so EFTA membership could be portrayed as ato the fold we should never have left. Rejoining EFTA would let the UK remain inside the European single market by also gaining eligibility to join the European Economic Areaand that would guarantee genuinely frictionless trade.Britain would leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the common agricultural and fisheries policies and be free of the drive towards “ever closer union” from the end of . And the “plus” bit – remaining in a temporary customs union – would allow goods to join services enjoying business asnormal instead of the impending chaos of a no-deal Brexit.But the price is high, especially for a party which consciously decided to follow the irresponsible and malicious path of blaming Brussels, EU nationals and immigrants for the Dickensian levels of poverty, inequality, starvation, collapse of public services and general hopelessness created by their own policies in Britain. There is therefore no way the Tories can sell a Norway-plus deal which accepts freedom of movement and “rule-taking” from Brussels while paying - per cent of full membership fees to feverishly Brexit-ready English voters. Of course, there’s another tiny problem with the Norway-plus option. Norway will block it.Last week, Heidi Nordby Lunde, Conservative MP and president of Norway’s European Movement, kicked British membership of the EFTA roundly into touch, telling Channel : “I’m sceptic to letting the UK into the EFTA family because it’s kind of like having an abusive partner spiking the drinks and inviting them to the Christmas party.”When askedshe felt that the potential of Britain joining the EFTA would upset the balance in that group, she added: “I think you would mess it all up for us, the way you have messed it up for yourselves.”This kind of reality check has so far been completely missing from Britain’s pie-in-the-sky Brexit debate and is all the more signicant because Norwegians are usually the world’s most diplomatic people – the product of compromise and consensus that comes from almost a century using PR in elections.But Lunde summed up Britain’s Norway-plus problems succinctly: “The Norway deal has four issues that I don’t think UK politicians want. First of all, we accept migration internally in the EU, we also accept rulings by the European Court of Justice, we accept the rules and regulations that we get from the EU. Also, being in the EFTA bloc, we can’t make our own free trade agreements without having Liechtenstein and Iceland with us.”Interestingly, none of these obstacles for “red line” Britain would create an insuperable barrier to an independent Scotland which wanted to pursue the EFTA EEA routeEFTA members and Scots decided that was preferable to full EU membership. But after this one short interview on Friday, Norway-plus stood roundly demolished as an option for Britain. Yet, unbelievably, the very next day, flying in the face of all that had just been said, Rudd became the first Cabinet minister to publicly back the Norway-plus modelMay’s Brexit deal is defeated in the Commons tomorrow. Even more incredibly, Rudd’s desperate advocacy of this non-viable Norway deal propelled the Work and Pensions Secretary back up the pollsters’ rankings in the race to become the next Tory leader. Mind you, since the attempt to keep legal advice from MPs also shunted Attorney General Geoffrey Cox into the running, why should anyone be surprised  Despite defeat in the Commons, Tory MPs and London-based political commentators were apparently moved and impressed by the gravelly, authoritative quality of his voice. These are the depths to which “leadership” in British politics has sunk.In short, a proposal that was comprehensively trashed only  hours earlier by a Norwegian Conservative politician has earned the deluded or deliberately obfuscating Rudd an even greater chance of taking over when May has gone.If folk believe this bourach can still be described as governance, they must be part of the minority – according to weekend surveys of Scottish public opinion – that still prefers Brexit in the UK to Scottish independence in Europe. You don’t have to be a card-carrying Christian for a verse of Matthew to come to mind: “Beware of  prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them.”Well, now all Scots know how the Conservative Party and the British Government choose to operate. They are always focused on the short term, always seeking one-off deals instead of long-term relationships, always feathering their own nests – recent European investments by leading Brexiteers haven’t escaped public attention – and always suspicious or careless of neighbours’ interests. It’ll be a very long time before the Irish forget Priti Patel’s appalling suggestion that the prospect of food shortages should be used to scare Irish people into submission over the backstop. Of course, Scots are not immune from Brexit or its ill effects.But looked at from the perspective of those boarding the leboat north of the Border today, there’s only one question left as Britain embarks on its final act of jaw-dropping self-harm.

I’ve only ever had a good sighting of one once – on the dunes at Coul Links in east Sutherland back in . Though I didn’t know it at the time, the animal I saw was unlikely to have been a pure-bred wildcat, despite displaying all the physical characteristics of the species, including a wonderfully bushy tail. It’s highly likely it was a hybrid between a domestic cat and the ancestors of the European wildcats that colonised Britain , years ago by crossing the ice which then connected us to the continent.Like many other species, wildcats have suffered a precipitous decline in numbers over several centuries due to a combination of habitat destruction and persecution. By the end of the th century, Victorian hunters had exterminated wildcats in England and Wales and only a few were hanging on in northern Scotland. In the th century, hunting reduced somewhat but by now the remaining wildcats had begun to breed with domestic cats creating a new race of hybrids.: ‘Enormous’ wildcat caught on camera in Aberdeenshire forestThis history of hybridisation makes the design of a conservation plan for the species a big challenge. Most, possibly all, purportedly ‘wild’ wildcats are to a greater or lesser extent a blend of domestic and wild genes. This raises a question. What are we conserving and why  If most or all are now hybrids, one approach could be to set a ‘percentage pure’ cut-off and try to focus on saving those that pass the test. To do this, however, will involve an awful lot of trapping and genetic testing. Another obvious problem is deciding on the percentage in the first place. Let’s say the cut-off is  per cent and a test result comes in for a given cat at  per cent – does this mean that inidual has no conservation value As complex and morally tricky as wildcat conservation is, there is a carefully thought through national plan which, in the long term, could see wildcats thrive again above the Highland fault line. The plan is being led by Scottish Wildcat Action, a partnership of  organisations, including my own, the Scottish Wildle Trust. It aims to save the wildcat by implementing a portfolio of actions underpinned by the best available science. : Wildcat kittens born at Edinburgh Zoo could provide ‘lele’ for the speciesThe partnership team has been working with local people in five priority areas – Strathbogie, Angus glens, northern Strathspey, Morvern and Strathpeffer – to reduce the risks of hybridisation, disease and accidental persecution whilst also gathering extensive data to improve our understanding of the species. It has also been improving habitat in places like Clashindarroch Forest, where sensitive forestry operations are creating ideal wildcat habitat with mosaics of open ground – often rich in prey such as field voles – in combination with denser plantation woodland.All of these actions will help but they are unlikely to be enough on their own. This is why Scottish Wildcat Action is also considering reinforcing remaining populations with wildcats bred in a conservation breeding programme being led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. In time,combined with trap-neuter-release schemes for feral cats, reinforcement could reverse the degree of hybridisation and help create self-sustaining breeding populations across large areas of the northern Highlands. We shouldn’t pretend that achieving such a vision will be easy, but we must surely try.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies. LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong .."},{"url":null,"title":"review kansa impress at mareel album launch ","story":".from their new album an early highlight of the set., an ode to making the most of the time you have, proved an audience favourite also.Huddled tight together in a semi-circle at the front of the Mareel stage, Kansa appeared in a number of dferent guises throughout the night, with fiddlers Lynda Anderson and Lois Nicol swapping sporadically.After the interval, former Kansa member Stewart Grains provided the audience with a mixture of reels and Christmas classics with the accompaniment of Kirsten Hendry on piano. reduced some audience members to tears.The night belonged to Kansa though, and theirto the stage for the end of the concert was greatly appreciated by the full audience.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8734911.1544460417!/image/image.jpg","title":"jonathan rea honorary degree i feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it s nice to be recognised","story":"Four-time World Superbike champion Jonathan Rea has received an honorary degree for his outstanding contribution to sport.The Co Antrim racer received the honorary degree of Doctor of Lettersfrom Ulster University at its winter graduation ceremony.World Superbike Champion Jonathan Rea collects his Honorary Graduate from the University of UlsterOf the occasion at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, he said: “It’s dficult to stand in a room full of highly educated people and receive an award like that when I haven’t gone to university. “But I have served my time.

In fact, one of my current co-workers is about to set up his own independent group there. “I was there at the end of October and plan to go back next summer.”She added: “It’s pretty intense work when I’m there and it doesn’t leave too much time to look around but everyone is so hospitable I guess thatmy parents wanted to visit we would have a guide show us around more.”Despite her busy workload Professor Fleming told us she will be flying home for Christmas to spend the season with her parents, family and friends.At last week’s full meeting of Mid and East Antrim Council, members offered their congratulations to councillor Wales and her daughter.Councillor Wales told theshe was “very pleased and very proud” of her daughter’s appointment.

The draw of playing with her friends a few metres away is just too much for her.“She loves to be involved in everything,# says Clotilde, #especially helping to prepare food and cook. She#s quick to learn.#The proud mum of four is thankful that Ines and her other children are growing up strong and healthy. She puts it down to a combination of a ied and nutritious diet and the help and advice of community-based health workers, carers and volunteers supported by international development charity Concern Worldwide.Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, where more than a third of the population don’t have enough food to eat. Poverty, political instability and scarce rainfall all contribute to high levels of food insecurity and hunger. And children, who make up around half the population, are disproportionately affected.What makes it even more of a challenge is that Clotilde and her family live in Cibitoke – an area with one of the highest levels of chronic malnutrition in the country. Every other child living there is chronically malnourished.Hunger prevents them from developing. It causes stunting and weakens their immune systems making them more susceptible to diseases. Their ability to grow and learn is permanently damaged. By the time they are two-years-old, the effects of chronic malnutrition are irreversible.The overall level of acute malnutrition in the area is also poor, with one in every  children moderately or severely malnourished. Last year, the UN estimated that as many as . million children in Burundi were impacted, with almost , under-fives requiring treatment for severe malnutrition.It is for that reason that aid agencies like Concern are targeting pregnant women, and mums with young children. The aim is to prevent malnutrition in the first place or spot the early signs before it takes hold.A few kilometres away, we meet another -year-old mum, Charlotte Nzeyimana. She has been walking for almost two hours carrying baby Keddy on her back and with four-year-old daughter Kyntia by her side.In the shade of a banana grove, Charlotte shares her concerns about young Kyntia, who sits motionless on the ground beside her. “My daughter is not very healthy,” she says.Seven months ago little Kyntia was diagnosed with oedema – a symptom of severe acute malnutrition. She was admitted to hospital and recovered after a month. But her situation remains precarious.“I breastfed her until she was three-years-old,# says Charlotte. #After that, she began to get sick. She has never had a ied diet – and has only ever eaten cassava paste.#In the next few weeks, though, Charlotte will begin to reap the benefits of the same vital health and nutrition advice and support that Clotilde enjoys.The programme, which started in July, is run by Concern with funding from the UK government. Last year, as part of the overseas charity’s Food in a Fragile World appeal, the public donated just over £, which was matched pound-for-pound by the government. That matched funding is now being used in this part of Burundi to help improve the lives of more than , under-fives at risk of malnutrition.At the heart of Concern#s efforts to tackle hunger is a team of  skilled Community Health Workers . They are trained to detect the early signs of malnutrition on the spot and treat certain illnesses and infections. Concern also supports , Care Group Volunteers and  Mother Leaders who promote breastfeeding and good nutrition, food preparation and hygiene practices.#We rely on our Community Health Worker,# says Clotilde. #She has treated my children for malaria and diarrhoea. Andthey fall sick again, she will know what to do.#Both Clotilde and her husband earn what they can from casual work cultivating cassava and corn. Between harvests and during lean times they sell eggs, buns, soap and home-made banana juice to friends and neighbours. It is enough for them to survive on.#The CHW has told us the importance of having a balanced diet,” she says. “We eat twice a day – mostly beans, corn, rice, cassava paste, sweet potatoes and vegetables.”On a steep hillside in Bukinanyana not far from where we met Charlotte, Community Health Worker Jeannette Icimanishatse is greeted by shouts and laughter. The -year-old grandmother is visiting one of ten households on her weekly rounds. It is clear that she has gained the trust and respect of her neighbours, encouraging them to take simple preventative measures to positively impact their children’s lives.“I am proud of what I do,” says Jeanette. “Mums depend on us for help. It is rewarding to know that we are doing something to make the le of the community better.”Community Health Workers like Jeannette refer any cases of severe acute malnutrition to the local health centre for specialist treatment. They even help to arrange transport and encourage mums to save a little for emergencies. Mothers whose children are moderately malnourished are enrolled in community-based nutrition demonstrations where they receive advice on key feeding and care practices. They are also given support to build a kitchen garden which enables them to have vegetables all year round, and an opportunity to be part of a savings and loans scheme.It is a highly effective approach, according to Sebastien Sebahizi, Concern’s Health and Nutrition Programme Manager in Cibitoke, because it focuses on behaviour change and peer-to-peer communication.“What we have observed,” he says, “is that some mothers in exactly the same living conditions have children who are healthy. We bring them into the programme as Mother Leaders and Care Group Volunteers, so that mums who are struggling can spend time with them and see how it’s done.”A further spin-off from tackling malnutrition at grassroots level is that less of a strain is placed on the therapeutic and stabilisation services provided by local clinics.“What we hope to achieve,” says Sebastien, “is to halve the number of childhood nutrition-related consultations in local health centres. That will ease the pressure on the system and enable medical staff to deal with more complicated cases.“But ultimately, our goal is to reduce childhood malnutrition and give more young children the opportunity to grow up healthy and well. It is something each one of them deserves.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"food bank demand in north belfast soars for yet another christmas","story":"THE demand for food for those in need this Christmas is as high as ever before after another tough year for many people in North Belfast.A year of drastic changes to welfare reform and the roll-out of the controversial universal credit in November has left more and more people in need of essential food products over the upcoming Christmas period.The annual drive by North Belfast Advice Partnership and Ligoniel Improvement Association is now on for donations for this year’s initiative to help local families across North Belfast.Sinead McKinley, who is helping co-ordinating this year’s food drive, said this year’s appeal is their most important ever.“This year once again we have been inundated with requests for food parcels and Christmas hampers,” she explained.“It has been a really tough year for families, with all the dferent changes to welfare policy on top of the higher cost of food and living generally and the uncertainty around Brexit, it means more people are in food poverty.“Utility bills are also getting higher yet benefits have been frozen for four years.“There is also the cruel Universal Credit which I believe has resulted mainly in an increased demand for the food bank.“People are on a five-week wait for the changeover in their benefits which has put them in debt coming up to Christmas. There is no mitigation payment for that crossover period because the Assembly collapsed before they could pass the legislation.”Started in , the local food bank drive resulted in a record number of people receiving hampers last Christmas, with a total of  hampers delivered to iniduals and families in need.Once again, Sinead is appealing for long-le food products, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and festive toys and gts amongst the vital donations for this year’s appeal.“We want to build on last year’s successful food bank drive success which resulted in  Christmas hampers delivered to those in need.“This year we expect the demand to be much higher and we will continue to work with our partners in St Vincent de Paul, St Patrick’s Soup Kitchen, Haven Outreach and Oasis Food Bank on the Shankill to meet demand.“We want to maximise resources to support a bigger group of people. Food is always the priority – it frees up other money for them to pay bills and spend a few pounds at Christmas time.“Christmas hampers are vital so that local families get through the festive period.

This week marks the th anniversary of the atrocity.At pm on December ,  – two days before the McGurk’s attack, British soldiers of the nd Battalion Royal Regiment Fusiliersraided and searched the Gem Bar close to McGurk’s Bar on North Queen Street.Less than  hours later, loyalist paramilitaries of the Ulster Volunteer Forcetargeted the Gem Bar for a major bomb attack. The Gem Bar was suspected by the British Army of being frequented by members of the Official IRA.The one convicted bomber, Robert James Campbell, confessed that the UVF gang drove to the area to attack the Gem Bar.It is believed that they could not plant the bomb there as young men were outside the bar so the bombers drove around the corner and pulled up beside the side entrance of McGurk’s Bar instead. One of the bombers got out of the car and placed the bomb in the entranceway, lit the fuse and ran back to the car which then sped off down Great George’s Street.Ciarán MacAirt said: “It is horric to contemplate that the British Army believed that the Gem Bar was frequented by members and supporters of the Official IRA and had raided the bar, searched it and screened its customers before lting a half dozen men. The action resulting from these lts is redacted in the files. Then, two nights later, pro-state loyalist extremists targeted the Gem Bar but failed to get clear access so made the fateful decision to attack the soft target of McGurk’s Bar instead.“We also know from these files, contrary to what the police and Office of the Police Ombudsman reported to our families, the British Army within an hourhad linked the Gem Bar to the bomb attack as the files record that McGurk’s Bar “was close to the Gem Bar” – but the British Army’s description of the Gem Bar is withheld from the families even after  years after the atrocity.“I believe the redacted information records that the Gem Bar was a ‘Goulding’ bar which in British military parlance denoted its alleged affiliation to the Official IRA whose leader at the time was Cathal Goulding. The reason that it is redacted could be that it shows that the British Army had correctly considered the Gem Bar to have been the target and the bombers loyalists. This alone would undermine the botched investigations our families have endured until now.“We also know from the same file that a British Army bomb expert had reported that the seat of the explosion was clearly in the entranceway and not inside the bar as the police had lied to the public, so the bar was attacked as witnesses had testied. Finally, from this signicant new discovery, we now know for a fact that the British Army’s covert death-squad, the Military Reaction Force, was operating in the area with  RRF who had raided the Gem Bar and we had long suspected that it had facilitated and directed the bombers.”Niall Ó Murchú of Kinnear and Co. Solicitors is legal representative for many of the McGurk’s Bar families. He added: “With every piece of new evidence which a family member had to find, it is becoming increasingly clear that the British army was involved in the planning and targeting of this bomb attack. “To allay all suspicion, we challenge Chief Constable George Hamilton and Police Ombudsman Michael Maguire to retrieve this file and release the information that the British Ministry of Defence is withholding from the families  years later.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish premier uk could halt or delay brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.— Donald TuskDecember , Mr Varadkar held a telephone conversation with European Council President Donald Tusk on Monday afternoon ahead of this week’s meeting of leaders in Brussels.The Irish premier added: “Our approach is that we have a deal on the table, a deal that has the support of  Governments, negotiated over  months.“Our objective is to get the deal ratied by the House of Commons and that is what we will be working on over the next couple of weeks, giving the UK the assurances it may need but never compromising on the basic fundamental substance and written letter of the backstop.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37610293.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/graph.jpg","title":"survey reveals 65 in northern ireland would now vote remain and 60 think united ireland more likely","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may to visit dublin for crucial brexit talks with taoiseach leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Jonathan Bell: I was disparaged and demonised just for telling the truth about my role in RHI scandal The RHI probe, which is led by retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin, will hear closing submissions over three days from tomorrow. This will include a short presentation of the evidence already heard over  days, as well as oral submissions from lawyers representing three key players - the Department for the Economy, the Department of Finance and regulator Ofgem.Oral submissions will also be heard from some of the  iniduals and organisations who were granted enhanced participatory rights. These include Mrs Foster, former DUP minister Jonathan Bell, a number of the partys special advisersand some senior civil servants.Mrs Foster was in charge of the Stormont department that set up the flawed scheme.As details of the scandal emerged later, she faced calls to stand down as First Minister. When she refused to step aside, Sinn Fein collapsed the Executive in January .The public inquiry has since exposed internal rows between senior DUP members and the power wielded by unelected Spads, as well as how codes that set standards for public le were apparently ignored routinely to get business done.In a closing statement to the inquiry, during which Mrs Foster gave five days of evidence, her lawyer said it will be up to the  to determine the impact of a \"lack of ministerial input\" on certain key issues.Mrs Foster, who launched the RHI scheme in  when Enterprise Minister, previously admitted to the inquiry that she did not read the legislation she introduced to the Assembly in her name.She also said that she was \"accountable but not responsible\" for her former Spad Dr Andrew Crawford.Mrs Foster said Dr Crawford never raised allegations that the RHI scheme was being abused with her, or the potential for a spike in applications. She told the inquiry she now believes both of those issues should have been brought to her attention when she was Finance Minister in .In her statement last night, Ms Ellison said Mrs Foster had been \"clear that she is accountable to the Assembly for the failings that occurred within Deti during her tenure as minister of that department\". \"She has welcomed the inquiry as a means of establishing the facts of what went wrong with the scheme and how to ensure it does not happen again. \"It is clear, however, that there were many issues that were not raised to ministerial level for either information or decision-making. \"It will be for the inquiry to determine the impact the lack of ministerial input on certain key issues has had, and whether, in light of the issues that were not raised, Mrs Foster was in a position to have done anything dferently such that the schemes adverse outcomes could have been avoided.\"At the DUPs annual conference last month, Mrs Foster said her party was \"deeply, deeply, sorry\" for its handling of the RHI scandal, which saw the Northern Ireland taxpayer open to a huge overspend because the scheme paid out more in subsidies than the cost of the fuel, leading to a \"burn-to-earn\" incentive.Last night her barrister repeated Mrs Fosters apology \"for the mistakes made\" by her party in the handling of the failed green energy scheme and that the RHI crisis has been the former First Ministers \"biggest regret both politically and personally\"."},{"url":null,"title":"backstop must be removed arlene foster insists ahead of prime minister theresa may meeting","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But he offered a glimmer of hope to Mrs May by saying there was room to give “further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker addressed MEPs in Strasbourg The delay to the so-called “meaningful vote” by MPs means that ratication may not be possible until as late as  weeks before the scheduled date of Brexit on March . But Mrs May’s spokesman insisted she continues to believe that necessary preparations can be completed within that time.The Prime Minister held talks over breakfast with her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte in The Hague, which Downing Street described as “constructive”.Mrs May told the Dutch PM that “additional assurances” would be needed on the backstop arrangement to keep the Irish border open after Brexitthe deal was to get through Parliament.“The leaders agreed that the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary, the Prime Minister set out the concerns held by many about it in the UK,” said her spokesman.“She discussed the need for additional assurances on this point in order for the deal with the EU to pass the House of Commons. The Prime Minister and Prime Minister Rutte agreed to work together to find a way through.Mrs May then flew on to Berlin for a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and was due to travel later in the day to Brussels for talks with Mr Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk.The weekly Tuesday morning Cabinet meeting was postponed because of Mrs May’s travels and will now be held on Wednesday afternoon, when preparations for a no-deal Brexit will be on the agenda.Mrs May will thento Brussels on Thursday for the two-day European Council summit, though it was unclear whether she would be invited to join leaders of the other  member states when they discuss Brexit. Mrs May’s move to abandon a crunch Commons vote, scheduled for Tuesday, on her Brexit deal drew howls of condemnation from the opposition as well as a number of Tories.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Leading Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker suggested that that PM had a “duty” to stand down in order for a new leader to deliver EU withdrawal.“What I would like to happen today is for Conservative Members of Parliament to realise that we simply cannot go staggering forward any longer like this and I’m afraid to put their letters of no confidence in,” Mr Baker told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.But Mrs May’s spokesman responded: “The Prime Minister believes it is her duty to deliver on the will of the British people and take us out of the EU.”Askedthe PM continued to have full confidence in chief whip Julian Smith, the spokesman replied: “Yes.”Mr Juncker won applause from MEPs as he said: “There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation, but of course there is roomused intelligently, there is room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement.I will meet @theresa_may this evening in Brussels. I remain convinced that the #Brexit deal we have is the best - and only - deal possible. There is no room for renegotiation, but further clarications are possible.— Jean-Claude JunckerDecember , “This will not happen: everyone has to note that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened.”He confirmed he would meet Mrs May on Tuesday evening but reiterated: “The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible – it is the only deal possible.”It came as Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom suggested Mrs May was seeking changes that would give Parliament an additional “democratic ability to decide”.“That might include an addendum to the Withdrawal Agreement that sets out that Parliament will vote prior to going into a backstop, should that prove necessary, and potentially that the EU Parliament and UK Parliament must vote every year thereafter to provide that legitimacy for the UK to stay in the backstop, should that prove necessary,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“So there are plenty of options for the PM to talk to the EU about that don’t involve reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but that would provide the legal text as a part of the Withdrawal Agreement, through perhaps an addendum.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May is facing repeated calls from leading Tory Brexiteers to be replaced as PM Downing Street declined to be drawn on the specic form of reassurance being sought by the PM, saying only that she needed to be sure that it was something which would satisfy MPs.As anger at Westminster continued to fester over the PM’s move to cancel the Brexit vote, MPs were poised for an emergency debate on the situation called by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on the day the “meaningful vote” was initially scheduled to take place.Mr Corbyn told MPs Mrs May was making an “abject mess” of the Brexit negotiations, and said his party would do the “appropriate thing at the appropriate time” when asked whether he would table a motion of no confidence in the Government.“We have no confidence in this Government.

Mrs Bradley said she fully supported the Prime Ministers decision, but said the deal was still in the best interests of Northern Ireland.\"The deal protects our precious Union with the  Belfast Agreement, and the consent principle at its heart, fully maintained. \"That is the constitutional guarantee for Northern Ireland and this Government will always uphold it,\" Mrs Bradley said.\"The deal ensures that there will be no customs border down the Irish Sea, with free and unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods and services into its most important market, Great Britain.\"She said the withdrawal agreement offered \"huge gains... for those of us who believe strongly in the Union\".And she warned: \"I am convinced that leaving the EU without an agreement would be disastrous for Northern Ireland and potentially for the long-term future of the Union. \"I am not prepared to take risks with or gamble the Union of the United Kingdom.\" Earlier the Prime Minister suggested that a united Ireland could move dramatically closerthe backstop is removed from the Brexit deal.In a warning that caused signicant surprise in Dublin, Mrs May openly admitted that voters in Northern Ireland may want to join the Republic rather than see border posts re-erected.\"Businesses operate across that border. People live their lives crossing and recrossing it every day,\" she said.\"Ive been there and spoken to some of those people. They do not want their everyday lives to change as a result of the decisions we have taken.\"They do not want ato a hard border. Andthis House cares about preserving our Union, it must listen to those people because our Union will only endure with their consent.\"An Irish Government source said: \"We have been very careful not to talk about a united Ireland during this, so to hear it from the British Prime Minister was extraordinary.\"On another day of shambolic politics in Westminster, the Prime Minister delayed todays so-called meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement and vowed to seek further reassurances from the EU on how the backstop will work.Mrs Mays U-turn came after she and senior ministers had spent days insisting the vote would go ahead despite the scale of opposition.Her statement to MPs is also a clear signal that her relationship with the DUP, who had been propping up her Government, is all but over.Addressing the Commons, the PM accepted that there was \"widespread and deep concern\" among MPs over the backstop, designed to keep the border openthe EU and UK fail to strike a wider trade deal. But she insisted that there was \"no deal available that does not include the backstop\". Mrs May is now expected to canvass EU leaders in a bid to secure additional reassurances for MPs on the backstop. It is believed she is seeking a declaration of sorts on the backstop which would underline its temporary nature in an effort to win over critics in the Commons.She will hold crisis talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel today and will meet Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague. In her statement to MPs, Mrs May also said the Government was stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit, despite saying that this would cause \"signicant economic damage to parts of our country\". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Government was \"in disarray\" and told Mrs May she should step asideshe was unable to deliver the \"fundamental changes\" needed to her plans. But Labour made clear it will hold back on a confidence motion until after Mrs May s to the Commons with whatever assurances she secures from EU leaders."},{"url":null,"title":"parents touched by organ donation decisions urge families to discuss the issue","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"department of health accused of having a complete lack of control in spending","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop. After his try-scoring cameo for the seconds last week, Ross Adair was added to the bench.The first half was a dour affair. Old Wesley scored an early converted try, but the lsquoHinchrsquos blanket defence was able to keep the home side at armrsquosfor the rest of the half andfour penalties from the booming left boot of Peter Nelson kept the visitors in touch.Two well struck penalties from the reliable Rory Stynes gave Old Wesley a narrow - lead at half-time.The arm wrestle continued early in the second half with another exchange of penalties making it - coming up to the hour mark.Ballynahinch were starting to dominate the physical exchanges and were rewarded with a try from replacement Adair as the game moved into the final quarter.He seems to have lost none of his electric pace following hip surgery and the coaching staff will hope to ease him back into the starting line-up as he gets more rugby under his belt.The travelling support were spared a nervy finish when front row replacement Campbell Classon went over following a sustained bout of lsquoHinch pressure on the Wesley line.Nelson completed a fine afternoonrsquos work with the boot with the conversion sealing a - victory.The rest of the results in B fell perfectly for the Co Down men and the top five teams are now separated by just two points, with Ballynahinch right in the mix for promotion once again.Old Wesley Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Daisy Lodge receives donation from Amazon Delivery Station  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE charity supporting children and young adults suffering from cancer has received a generous donation from an online delivery company giant.Daisy Lodge welcomed the pound, donation from Amazon Delivery Station and plans to use the donation to provide a child undergoing cancer treatment with short break to Daisy Lodge.Daisy Lodge provides a leline for every young person diagnosed with cancer or living with a parent with the disease during and after treatment so that no family has to face cancer alone.

At the touch of a switch the sun roof and windows open, the seats adjust and the radio aerial goes up and down. The steering is adjustable, the boot opens from a switch on the dash, the lights automatically dip when meeting a car and there is a special lsquoclimate controlrsquo knob. The car also boasts quahonic radio and tapes, a miniature dressing table with lights and a place for a TV.ldquoI was over in England and called in with a friend dealt in American cars. I saw the Cadillac, fancied it and told him I would come back the following week with a view to purchasing it, Jim said.Worth around pound,, Jim reckons it was a real snip and it leaves him in a position to sell his other American car, a  Buick. ldquoComing from the sunshine of state of Florida, there was no rust on it and it was rather frustrating when someone bumped into it after only three weeks on Northern Ireland roads, he added.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick police have warned motorists to lock up their vehicles properly when they go Christmas shopping.The warning comes after recent incidents in the town involving the theft of cars, including one which was taken from a car park at Downtown Shopping Centre.A Ford Cortina car was stolen from Raholp last Wednesday and was later found in a field after crashing through a hedge, while a car was stolen in Market Street and later found in St Patrickrsquos Drive.ldquoA police spokesman said: ldquoThe Christmas period is a time when many cars are stolen. So car owners must secure their vehicles properly and put valuables away when they go shopping.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is in danger of folding mdash unless more of the townrsquos shopkeepers start supporting the monthly meetings.Poor attendances over the past number of months have left organisers demoralised to such an extent that the possibility of folding is having to be considered.Indeed, only a large turn-out at next Tuesday nightrsquos meeting can save the organisation mdash so it is hoped shopkeepers will support the Chamber.A spokesman for the Chamber said: ldquoWe are the only voice the shopkeepers have, so it is in the interests of local traders to give us as much support as possible.ldquoOnly about one third of the townrsquos shopkeepers are actually registered members and there is always an open invitation to any others to attend.ldquoBut it is the turn-out of the registered members that is slightly disturbing. Most actually attend throughout the course of the year, but quite often it is dferent faces cropping up each month. If only all could come every month, instead of some on occasional months, then we would be a good, strong .The spokesman added: ldquoThere are many issues which can be debated and decisions reached which affect traders and shoppers, so it is hoped that our next meeting will see a revival of interest.NEWCASTLE mdash A petition urging a halt to work on a house in Newcastle was presented to Down councillors at their meeting this week.Signed by  local residents, the petition added fire to Cllr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuersquos claim that the builder had overstepped the restrictions of the original planning permission.After one-and-a-half hours of heated argument the council agreed on a majority decision to ask the planning authority to reconsider the application.Cllr OrsquoDonoghue said the house in King Street was originally given the go-ahead as a two-storey duelling, but had now developed an additional storey. He said the house as being built much higher than it should be and that it was dwarfing the adjacent houses.Cllr Ethel Smyth disagreed strongly with Cllr OrsquoDonoghue and said she felt that the builder was being victimised.KILLOUGH mdash A new pound, housing development in Killough was officially opened last Friday mdash three months ahead of schedule. The development, which consists of  houses, is situated at Castle Street-Main Street on a site which was originally acquired by the old East Down Rural Council.It was eventually transferred to the Housing Executive, but dficulties regarding site boundaries were not resolved until .

However, the contractor has managed to complete the development three months ahead of schedule.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash An exciting new multi-body committee, pledged to crush threats of over-exploitation of Strangford Lough, is expected to be set up within the next three months.The ambitious move is the product of recommendations by a Government working group which was formed two years ago to probe increasing pressures on the lough and surrounding area.The group has concluded that the lough could have massive future potentialit can be preserved in its present unspoilt state.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast.

Sadly, children are growing up in a society that is saturated with technology and it appears to be hindering their development in reading and understanding.Five Famous Dogs of Ireland brings to le the best loved of all the Irish hounds in history since Finn McCool and his favourite dog, Bran, strolled these parts.They include the much loved best friend of Manus OrsquoKane, an ancient chieftain from the Glens. His wolfhound was called Bawn and was known to be the best jumping dog in all of Ireland and could scare off the meanest of enemies.Mrs Donnelly said: ldquoI had the privilege to grow up with stories such as Bran. I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation. So much of our heritage and culture is being lost on our young generation.ldquoThis series of books is a way for me to rescue those stories. This generation is seeing a lot more children who are hyper active but a book in hand can be a slowing down tool to enjoy in a park or curled up on the sofa.Five Famous Dogs of Ireland would make a great Christmas gt for any child or adult.

He doesnrsquot hog the limelight ndash in fact quite the opposite. He stays away from it. His hero status is earned, though, his earning of the status is not a deliberate focus.

I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this.

Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people. We have a great staff team and Knockevin has many, many family connections with the area which is so lovely..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Presentation night at Spa Golf Club  ","story":"FINAL closure on Sparsquos  playing season came on Saturday night when Marian Armstrong and Mark Smyth were named the clubrsquos golfers of the year.It was a remarkable achievement for Marian who claimed the title for a fourth time along with the addition of five other trophies she collected at Sparsquos presentation night.Meanwhile, the Spa team captains will soon be knocking on the door of Mark as they make their selections for the  inter-club matches.While this was his first golfer of the year award, he won three other trophies and over the course of the season has seen his handicap plummet from  to the present .Club captain John Robinson said it had been a great year for Spa for many reasons including the achievements of the ious teams.The Pierce Purcell squad reached the final of the competition while the Sam Rutherford and Rossmore teams also won through to the closing games.He thanked everyone for their tremendous support during his year in office including the council, club officers and staff including the green keepers who, he said, had protected and improved Sparsquos most precious asset.Congratulating all the winners, Mr Robinson said the consistent high quality of play meant it was never easy to win a trophy at Spa Golf Club, but to those who achieved their golfing ambitions in  it was a case of ldquovery well done.Lady captain Carol Shields also thanked the large number of club officers and staff who had made her term in office such an enjoyable experience.She said it had been ldquoan absolute pleasure to work with Mr Robinson, describing him as ldquoa perfect gentlemen who has been a great ambassador for Spa Golf Club.Menrsquos prizewinners: Golfer of the Year , Mark Smyth Winter League trophy, Greg Wilson, Tom Wilson and Julian Kelly Gordon Cup, Robert Gartley Sunbound Cup, Barry Stevens Shaw Cup Doubles, Larry Power and Tom Coburn Lowe Cup, John Munn Holmes Cup, Daniel Connolly Scotia Cup, David Corr John Smith Cup , Bobby Wallace and Mandy Murphy Vice-Presidentrsquos cup, Alan Stevens Mark Gibson Trophy, Gordon Martin Montalto Cup, Alan McNamara Boyd Cup, Mark Smyth Ferguson Cup, Larry Power Eric Dodd Cup, Brian McQueen Wallace Cup, Mark Smyth Joe Mulholland Cup, Chris Donaldson La Carte Trophy, David Kidd Sam Graham Cup, Daniel Connolly Action Press Cup, Daniel Connell H L Hegan Cup, Mark Smyth Plessey Cup, James Walker McIlveen Cup, Alan McNamara Caldwell Cup, Eamon Canavan D J Bell Cup, Brian Blythe Eden na Vadie Cup, Brendan McAlarney Summit Trophy, Sammy Gurr Brian Irvine Cup, Gary Simpson Walter Moore Cup, Alan Stevens Dominic Stratton Cup, Brian McGrillen Forthill Cup, Larry Power Spa Cup, Brian Rea Sunday Jug, Barry Stevens.Ladiesrsquo prizewinners: Golfer of the Year, Marian Armstrong Hugh Gordon Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Challenge Cup, Suzanne McLoughlin Caldwell Cup, Mandy Murphy Lindsay Cup, Lynsey Martin Josie Murray Cup, Gillian Earls Kinray Trophy, Beth Coburn Combat Cancer Trophy, Marian Armstrong  Challenge Trophy, Sally Ann Douglas Slieve Croob Cup, Vivienne Abernethy McRoberts Rose Bowl, Pam Trohear Harvest Cup, Catherine McEvoy Plessey Cup, Ellie Smyth Mr Presidentrsquos Cup , Lisa McCavery Victor and Rita Ginesi Cup, Mandy Murphy Sena Feneran Cup, Marian Armstrong Ladiesrsquo Foursomes Matchplay Trophy, Sally Ann Douglas and Carol Shields Howitt Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Montalto Cup, Alex Murphy Adams Aiken Trophy, Stephanie Rea McIlveen Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Hunter Cup, Marian Armstrong Lowe Cup, Gwyneth Cordner McEvoy Cup, Carol Shields Coburn Cup, Marian Armstrong Sarah Brennan Cup, Mandy Murphy Maureen Hanna Trophy, Gwyneth Cordner Lynne Robinson Trophy , Marian Armstrong..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Seaforde machine on target  ","story":"SO close for the Saints in this first round tie as they had the league leaders on the ropes for much of this match, with it only being decided on the final run of games.After last weekrsquos below par performance against the same opposition, the home side battled better in keeping the games tight as Francie McGreevy lost narrowly - to Derek McCann and Des McAuley lost - to David Boal.The next run of games saw another tight away win, this time Graham Christie beating Collie Brown -.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters. Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Craigavon Manager Jenner Fearon said: “It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position after our long association with the Citizens Advice brand. From December we will be changing our name to Community Advice Craigavon. For us it is ‘business as usual’.“We have been in talks with Advice NI since the summer and are looking forward to working with our colleagues in the independent advice sector and at Advice NI. We have already moved to a new case management system and we view this as opportunity to improve and develop. We will continue to focus on helping our clients who are experiencing increasing pressures as a result of welfare reform changes and the universal credit roll out. We are grateful for the continued support of the Department for Communities, ABC Council, the Southern Health  Social Care Trust  Macmillan Cancer Support. “We offer help with welfare benefits advice, completion of forms, advice on employment law, consumer rights, housing problems and immigration law. We also have a dedicated debt advice service, guidance on private pensions via the Pensionwise Service  tribunal representation. We have a Macmillan Benefits Service which operates out of Craigavon Hospital for clients with cancer and family members. “We have been able to set up a digital area in our Lurgan office at Mount Zion House.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
